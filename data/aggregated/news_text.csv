BofA needed a calm figure to lead the clean-up, put the bank back on an even keel and restore investor confidence. It chose Moynihan, who would become Wall Street's quiet man: lacking the brashness of some of his peers, he has pursued a strategy he calls “responsible growth”, shunning many of the riskiest bets in an attempt to avoid the pitfalls of the pre-crisis era.",Bank of America,Matthew Garrahan,"BofA's CEO on Trump, King Charles and keeping the brakes on risk",2025-01-13,False,news,"News article by Matthew Garrahan

This could help banks boost their revenues, via higher deal volumes, and lending activity, as well as possibly lower compliance costs which could directly boost profitability. Trump has also been in favor of tax cuts, which could also help the bottom lines of banks such as Bank Of America.",Bank of America,Trefis Team,What To Expect From Bank Of America Stock In 2025?,2025-01-21,False,news,"News article by Trefis Team
