"First, our banking system as a whole is very strong. While a small handful of institutions still have challenges to overcome, the U.S. financial system remains unmatched globally.

"The U.S. system comprises a healthy mix of community banks, regional banks and global banks including Citi. We all have important but different roles to play, serving different clients with different needs and on different scales. I would also point to the rapid response by state, federal and international regulators that helped reinforce confidence in the system at a critical juncture.",quarter,Jane Fraser,CEO,1,Prepared remarks,Q1_2023,2023-04-14,Citigroup,transcript,"Jane Fraser (CEO)

"We are in a position to play this role because our strategy is delivering a simpler, more focused bank. We benefit from a diversified earnings base and resilient business model.

"The cornerstone is our institutional deposit base, which comprises about 60% of our deposits.

"The Fed continues to use rate policy to battle inflation, which has been more than stubborn in services, even as we see signs of cooling in labor and manufacturing. We expect the recent events to be disinflationary and credit to contract. We believe it is now more likely that the U.S. will enter into a shallow recession later this year. That could be exacerbated in depth and duration in a more severe “credit crunch.” But right now, the biggest unknown is the impact on terminal short-term US interest rates and, of course, how the debt ceiling plays out.",quarter,Jane Fraser,CEO,2,Prepared remarks,Q1_2023,2023-04-14,Citigroup,transcript,"Jane Fraser (CEO)

"In Europe, the ECB is on a similar, but more difficult, quest to tame inflation. They have had some help from lower-than-expected energy prices and the outlook continues to be a bit brighter. However, the war in Ukraine sadly shows no sign of ending and Europe faces more structural challenges such as the need for increased defense spending, higher energy costs and fiscal burdens that will make efforts to dampen inflation and stimulate growth more difficult.",quarter,Jane Fraser,CEO,2,Prepared remarks,Q1_2023,2023-04-14,Citigroup,transcript,"Jane Fraser (CEO)

"In Asia, the reopening of China is adding to the momentum in the region although the Chinese consumer has been slower to rebound than expected. I saw many green shoots firsthand talking to our clients and our bankers in my various trips to India, Japan, and Hong Kong this year. We have to keep a close eye on geopolitics as the US-China relationship becomes increasingly strained and is fragmenting economic blocs.

We had good revenue growth of 6% ex-divestitures and both revenue and expenses were in line with our guidance. Our ROTCE of nearly 11% benefitted from the closing of the sales of our consumer businesses in India and Vietnam and would have been over 9% without those gains.",quarter,Jane Fraser,CEO,2,Prepared remarks,Q1_2023,2023-04-14,Citigroup,transcript,"Jane Fraser (CEO)

"In Services, TTS continued to go from strength to strength, with revenues up 31%. Non-interest revenue was up 11% quarter-on-quarter-on the back of increased cross-border activity and good performance in commercial cards due to the rebound of corporate travel. Securities Services wasn’t too shabby either, up 23% as we executed on new mandates, onboarded new AUC and benefitted from higher rates.",quarter,Jane Fraser,CEO,3,Prepared remarks,Q1_2023,2023-04-14,Citigroup,transcript,"Jane Fraser (CEO)

"Thank you, Jane, and good morning, everyone. I am going to start with the Firmwide financial results, focusing on year-over-year comparisons for the first quarter unless I indicate otherwise, and spend a little more time on expenses, our balance sheet and capital.

"On slide 4, we show financial results for the full firm. In the first quarter, we reported net income of approximately $4.6 billion and an EPS of $2.19 and a RoTCE of nearly 11% on $21.4 billion of revenues. Embedded in these results are pre-tax divestiture-related impacts of approximately $950 million, largely driven by the gain on sale of the India consumer business. Excluding these items, EPS was $1.86 with an RoTCE of over 9%.",quarter,Mark Mason,CFO,4,Prepared remarks,Q1_2023,2023-04-14,Citigroup,transcript,"Mark Mason (CFO)

"In the quarter, total revenues increased by 12% on a reported basis and increased 6% excluding divestiture-related impacts as strength across Services, Fixed Income and .S Personal Banking was partially offset by declines in Investment Banking, Equity Markets and Wealth, as well as the revenue reduction from the closed exits and wind-downs.",quarter,Mark Mason,CFO,4,Prepared remarks,Q1_2023,2023-04-14,Citigroup,transcript,"Mark Mason (CFO)

"Our results include expenses of $13.3 billion, an increase of 1% versus the prior year. Excluding divesture-related costs in the prior year, expenses increased by 5% largely driven by the transformation, other risk & control investments and inflation, partially offset by productivity savings and the expense reductions from the exits and wind-downs.",quarter,Mark Mason,CFO,4,Prepared remarks,Q1_2023,2023-04-14,Citigroup,transcript,"Mark Mason (CFO)
Citigroup, Q1, 2023 Earnings Call Transcript, Page 4"
"Cost of credit was approximately $2.0 billion, primarily driven by the continued normalization in Card net credit losses and ACL and other provision builds of approximately $700 million, largely related to a deterioration in macroeconomic assumptions and growth in card revolving balances.",quarter,Mark Mason,CFO,4,Prepared remarks,Q1_2023,2023-04-14,Citigroup,transcript,"Mark Mason (CFO)

"On Slide 5, we show an expense walk for the first quarter, with the key underlying drivers. Transformation investments drove ~1% of the growth largely in the data, finance and risk and control programs. And 4% of the increase is driven by structural, largely in the form of compensation and benefits including the full-year impact of the people we hired last year as well as those we hired in the first quarter.",quarter,Mark Mason,CFO,4,Prepared remarks,Q1_2023,2023-04-14,Citigroup,transcript,"Mark Mason (CFO)

"Embedded in this structural bucket are a few key items. First, other risk and control investments that are enterprise wide and in the businesses make up about 2% of the total expense increase. Second, the impact of additional front and back-office hires. Third, inflation and severance costs. All of this was partially offset by productivity savings as well as the benefit from foreign exchange translation and the expense reduction from the exits and across the firm, technology-related expenses grew 12%.",quarter,Mark Mason,CFO,5,Prepared remarks,Q1_2023,2023-04-14,Citigroup,transcript,"Mark Mason (CFO)

"On slide 7, we show net interest income, deposits, and loans where I’ll speak to sequential variances. In the first quarter, net interest income increased by approximately $80 million, largely driven by interest-earning balances in cards. Average loans were up slightly as growth in PBWM was largely offset by a decline in ICG. Average deposits were also up slightly, driven by growth in both PBWM and ICG.

Second, we returned $1.0 billion in the form of common dividends, which drove a reduction of about 9 basis points.

"Hi, thank you, a simple one. I appreciate the many, many moving parts, but your first quarter NII and revenue production was great, and if you just annualize it, you're handily ahead of your full year guide.

"Yeah, thanks, Glenn, and good morning. Appreciate the question. Look, we did have a very solid first quarter, but as Jane mentioned in her prepared remarks, there are a number of things that are still out there in the global macro environment that are uncertain and unclear, including, frankly, as we contemplate the direction of rates and what's required to tame inflation, let alone the uncertainty that we've seen in parts of the sector here through the quarter.",quarter,Mark Mason,CFO,9,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-14,Citigroup,transcript,"Mark Mason (CFO)

"And so when I think about that and I think about how frankly betas have evolved and the likelihood of a recession in the back half of the year, which we have built into our outlook, I remain comfortable with the guidance that we've set here. And when you think about where that comes from, the strength in TTS, the strength in Securities Services, both benefiting from the rate hikes we saw last year, but also deepening relationships with new and existing clients, the Card momentum, which is really about seeing more revolving activity as payment rates start to slow, and the recovery in Investment Banking and Wealth is not as swift as we would like and so we have to see how that plays out too.",quarter,Mark Mason,CFO,9,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-14,Citigroup,transcript,"Mark Mason (CFO)

"So, slide 25 and 26 people should look at because they're great and they show the stability of your deposit franchise, but I'm curious if history can change at all. Meaning right now, those are cash and operating deposits that clients keep with you and they need you, and you're fully integrated, but do you have client concentrations we should know about or are you thinking about any big changes that can happen in terms of client behavior relative to the past in terms of what they keep at any given bank?

"Glenn, I'll kick it off and pass it over to Mark. I feel very comfortable about how very well-diversified our deposit base is across different countries, industries, clients, and currencies. It's extremely strong in that respect, and as you say, the majority of the Institutional deposits are integrated into the operating accounts all around the world to enable the clients to run their day-to-day operations, the payroll, the working capital, the supplier financing, et cetera.",quarter,Jane Fraser,CEO,10,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-14,Citigroup,transcript,"Jane Fraser (CEO)

"And I think what's changed in the more digital world is frankly these have become even stickier because the amount of data, the extent of integration into the technology platforms and systems of the clients and the value that we extract and present back to the clients from the combination of our FX trade, cash, et cetera, flows, is incredibly important in driving their efficiency, their risk management, and their financial performance as well. So both the extent of that diversification and the increasing stickiness versus history is something that we're certainly not complacent about, but I think is why you see from the pages we've put into the deck as well including in the back on just the consistency of this base.",quarter,Jane Fraser,CEO,10,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-14,Citigroup,transcript,"Jane Fraser (CEO)

"The only thing I'd add additional to that would be obviously we're in an environment where there's quantitative tightening that's occurring. That's going to have a broad industry impact as we've started to see already, but we're also in an environment where rates are increasing. We'll see how that plays out through the balance of the year. That has an impact on betas, but we shouldn't mistake price-sensitivity or interest rate sensitivity with the stickiness of the deposits. And so we've obviously talked about betas increasing particularly in our TTS portfolio, more so in the US. It obviously will continue to increase outside of the US, but we'll work the relationship that we have with those clients and the breadth of services that we bring to influence and impact pricing, and more importantly, because of the operating nature of them, we do see them as very stable.",quarter,Mark Mason,CFO,10,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-14,Citigroup,transcript,"Mark Mason (CFO)

"Oh, thank you, Mike, and a great question. I think one of the numbers I'm almost more happy about than the stellar revenue growth was the fee growth quarter-over-quarter here because obviously, we've been benefiting in TTS from the rates environment but we've also been benefiting from the drivers behind the franchise. And the fee revenues are coming from multiple different products and different offerings that we have here, and we're typically looking and have consistently looked at growing our fee revenue as a percentage of the underlying growth in TTS.",quarter,Jane Fraser,CEO,10,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-14,Citigroup,transcript,"Jane Fraser (CEO)

"Yeah, so again, I think that there is certainly more opportunity in terms of how rates move and capturing NII as you pointed out outside of the US. We articulate our interest rate exposure for a parallel shift and that mix at the end of last year was the 90/10 that you mentioned for non-US.

"My first question is a follow-up to Betsy. I think everybody were certainly impressed, Jane, at the Andy Sieg hire, and clearly, he was running a much larger business than what Citi has today. And this is sort of a tricky question. Clearly, you're still working through some of the transformation. There's still a consent order, but given your strength as a global player, could Citi participate in perhaps inorganic opportunities that could be out there, having a result perhaps of the liquidity crisis that we saw that could potentially enhance your Wealth Management footprint more quickly?",quarter,Erika Najarian,Analyst,12,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-14,Citigroup,transcript,"Erika Najarian (Analyst)

Appreciate the fact that the potential sale of the Mexico franchise would be a negative impact, but you're sitting at a pretty comfortable cushion now above your target.

"Yeah, thanks, Jim, and good morning. As you point out, we grew capital pretty sizably this quarter, up to 13.4% from a CET1 ratio point of view and up significantly from a year ago, some 200 basis points or so.

"Look, the way we think about it is that 13.4%, we certainly have well-above what's required from a regulatory point of view and it includes our internal management buffer of about 100 basis points. But as we've said in the past, there is certainly the Mexico transaction and that would be a temporary drag to CET1 at signing, the difference between signing and closing if it were a sale to take place.

And so when I think about all of those factors, we're in a place where we will continue to take it quarter-by-quarter, but I'd end by saying our bias is kind of where yours is, which is given where we're trading, all things being equal, we'd like to be buying back shares, but we have to be responsible about that and the timing of that.",quarter,Mark Mason,CFO,13,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-14,Citigroup,transcript,"Mark Mason (CFO)

"So in terms of the reserve, again, remember we have a couple of different scenarios that we run when we calculate the CECL reserves.

"The other point worth mentioning is that in this particular calculation for the quarter, we did skew a little bit more towards the downside in terms of the probability weighting than last quarter, in light of the macro environment and the combination of that as well as some normalization in the portfolio including an increase in revolver activity contributed to the increase in reserves we saw.",quarter,Mark Mason,CFO,13,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-14,Citigroup,transcript,"Mark Mason (CFO)

"Yeah, I'd jump in before you turn to Banking as well. I think one of the differences with our franchise compared to some others is that we are the go-to bank for corporates, and that provides a highly attractive but pretty steady flow of activity. This is obviously in the volatile markets we've been seeing is from our perspective very good volatility because we're able to support our clients in rates, FX, commodity hedging, and it makes our risk flows much more diversified than our competitors particularly in volatile markets like this.

"No, thank you, I think that's exactly right in terms of the corporate client base there. Look, in Investment Banking, obviously the wallets were down meaningfully last year. We saw some good performance in debt capital markets this quarter, up 66% versus the prior quarter, particularly as we saw activity in the investment grade names, which is an area of strength for us for sure, and I think there was a bit of momentum behind a bit more clarity on the direction of rates, and so we'll see how that continues to evolve and play out.",quarter,Mark Mason,CFO,14,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-14,Citigroup,transcript,"Mark Mason (CFO)

"I think there are a couple of things to kind of keep in mind in terms of PBWM fees, and I think part of it is that PBWM is a combination of both the Cards business as well as the Wealth business, and a good amount of the pressure that we've seen in fees and that is still subject to how the environment evolves is in the Wealth space, because we continue to see fee pressure on investment activity and revenues there, and we'll have to see how the market valuations move on some of the assets that we manage on behalf of clients and what momentum it drives in terms of more investment activity.

"The upside that we've seen in fees in Banking and Cards, again, I think will be subject to how activity and volume evolves across our Cards business.

One, in terms of the Banamex sale, I think, Jane, you mentioned that maybe we might hear something relatively soon and you still are pursuing the dual track process. One, if you do decide to go the IPO route, does that change the accounting dynamics, Mark, with regards to taking that hit early on if given just the time it might take to go through an IPO.

"So we've got an enormous body of work going on in Mexico to separate out the Institutional business. I'm pleased with the progress they're making. I think we're seeing, when we look at the performance of our Mexican franchise, a lot of the really strong performance is happening in our ICG business where Mexico is such a beneficiary of the supply chain dynamics that are happening around the world, and its location is obviously very beneficial given the proximity to the US as well.

Everything we're doing is positioning us for both a private sale and/or an IPO, and we'll choose the path that's best for shareholders. An IPO would take longer. It would likely take longer as we would want a set of full audited financials, et cetera. I would say that in terms of what the implications would be from an accounting point of view, CTA accounting is different for an IPO so we would not recognize that CTA through the P&L in an IPO.

"Yeah, look, again, look, the expense base is a key area of focus for us, right? We recognize that expenses have been growing. They've been growing because we've been investing in the franchise both transformation-wise as well as business-led growth to support the competitive advantages that we have in many of our franchises, but we're managing that very actively and very deliberately, and that means that we're looking to ensure that we're spending the money in the right way in the right places and that we're going to yield the benefits that we expect from that over time. And that was all factored into the targets that we set at our Investor Day for the medium-term, and what that requires is that we start bending the curve in 2024 as I stated and that we end in that medium-term at a place where we have an operating efficiency of about 60% and we're positioned to have returns that are in that 11% to 12% RoTCE point of view.",quarter,Mark Mason,CFO,16,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-14,Citigroup,transcript,"Mark Mason (CFO)

"There are a couple of factors that are going to contribute to lowering that expense base. One, the divestitures that we've been talking about, right. The second is the benefits from the transformation and other investments that I've just referenced. And the third is further organizational and management simplification efforts that we have underway that are enabled by the idea that we're exiting 14 consumer countries. And so those three factors, if you will, become very important to ensure that we get to that lower cost structure and that we're able to deliver on the broader commitments that we're making with regards to returns.",quarter,Mark Mason,CFO,16,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-14,Citigroup,transcript,"Mark Mason (CFO)

"Thank you. Hi, Jane. Hi, Mark. A couple questions. Jane, maybe starting with you first, or Mark, both of you can answer it. In view of what the disruptions we've seen in the banking system in the month of March with what went on with the regional banks here in the US and obviously the large investment bank over in Switzerland, do you guys see changes coming, or what changes do you see coming in terms of regulatory whether it's more capital, more liquidity, and it may not be directed at a company like yours because you're a global SIFI already and it might be more regionally orientated in the United States. And as part of this question, Jane, can you guys give us some color on the deposit you and your peers made into First Republic? What was the thinking behind that as well?",quarter,Gerard Cassidy,Analyst,16,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-14,Citigroup,transcript,"Gerard Cassidy (Analyst)

"Sure. Thank you for the question, Gerard. Well, I'd say that we hope that there will be a thoughtful and targeted approach to any changes in the regulatory and capital framework and that they address the root causes of what actually happened here, and what happened is a combination of macro impacts from the sharp, rapid rate increases and some idiosyncratic situations, namely a lack of proper asset and liability management at a small handful of banks.",quarter,Jane Fraser,CEO,16,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-14,Citigroup,transcript,"Jane Fraser (CEO)
Citigroup, Q1, 2023 Earnings Call Transcript, Page 16"
"We don't see these issues as pervasive throughout the broader banking industry, but the events certainly highlight the importance of prudent asset and liability management. We still believe that there is plenty of capital amongst the large banks, and if capital requirements were to increase for the large banks by the regulators it would exacerbate any credit tightening that might go on.",quarter,Jane Fraser,CEO,17,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-14,Citigroup,transcript,"Jane Fraser (CEO)
Citigroup, Q1, 2023 Earnings Call Transcript, Page 17"
"And related to that, what continues to keep me most awake at night is the quantity and quality of activity in the shadow banking industry. It does not benefit from the same regulatory frameworks and protections for participants, and I, amongst others, fear that more activity getting driven into it, if the banking capital requirements increase, will be to the detriment of system strength and stability. So we hope that this approach will be thoughtful and targeted to where the issues actually were.",quarter,Jane Fraser,CEO,17,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-14,Citigroup,transcript,"Jane Fraser (CEO)

"And let's just step back for a minute. In the face of tremendous market uncertainty, 11 of the largest US banks were able to come together to inject $30 billion of deposits into First Republic in a little over one day, and that speaks volumes for our capital and balance sheet positions, and I think the responsibility of large institutions in recognizing that we also play an important role here in helping stabilize situations like this. We thought it was very important to help buy some time and also demonstrate our confidence in the overall US banking system. So, I hope that gives you a bit of a flavor.",quarter,Jane Fraser,CEO,17,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-14,Citigroup,transcript,"Jane Fraser (CEO)

"No, very, very insightful. Very good. Thank you. And then as a follow-up question, I noticed in your Card, I think it was slide 8, you give us the prime, 80% of the portfolio is prime, which is FICO scores greater than 680. I don't know if you would agree with this statement, but we're hearing that there was some FICO score inflation as a result of the pandemic. A lot of consumers saw their FICO scores go up, and I've seen numbers as high as 70 points, that may be on the high side, but can you guys, do you agree with that, and if you do, would you then expect the 700 FICO score customer at some point to behave like a 650 score customer?",quarter,Gerard Cassidy,Analyst,17,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-14,Citigroup,transcript,"Gerard Cassidy (Analyst)

"I think what's really important here, Gerard, is kind of what we're seeing in the way of the performance of the portfolio. So again, I've heard that sentiment regarding FICO score inflation. We feel very confident in how we've assessed our customers and what it means to have 80% of our customers prime and greater than 680. I think importantly, what we're seeing is we're seeing payment rates start to slow. We're seeing average interest-earning balances start to increase. We're seeing NCL rates increase, but particularly driven by the lower FICO score customers across the portfolio which is where you would expect to start to see that drag occur, and the NCL rates that we're seeing are still well below what we would see in a normal cycle and they're in line with what we've been forecasting for performance. So there are no surprises that we're seeing in terms of how that curve is evolving. We'd expect that it will get back to those normal levels towards the beginning of next year. It will likely play through those normal levels a bit before tapering.",quarter,Mark Mason,CFO,17,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-14,Citigroup,transcript,"Mark Mason (CFO)

"But my point here is that we understand our customers, the portfolio, and how it reacts to the environment enough to forecast that out, and so far, that's been performing in line with that forecast and those estimates. And importantly, we continue to stress it to make sure we're not missing anything and importantly, we carry a sizable reserve, as you know, as part of that $20 billion.",quarter,Mark Mason,CFO,17,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-14,Citigroup,transcript,"Mark Mason (CFO)

"I'd also add that we don't just rely on FICO scores for assessing the credit of our customers and our portfolio.

"Thank you. Thanks for taking my questions, Mark and Jane. Mark, I want to go to your revenue, I hear you, you're keeping the revenue guidance unchanged. What is in your revenue assumption, just want to unpeel that onion a little bit. What's in your revenue assumption for rates, US and internationally, and what is going on with deposit betas particularly following the inflows you've seen recently in the US with the crisis?",quarter,Vivek Juneja,Analyst,18,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-14,Citigroup,transcript,"Vivek Juneja (Analyst)
Citigroup, Q1, 2023 Earnings Call Transcript, Page 18"
"Yeah, so, I guess a couple things. One, in terms of the rates that we've assumed, in the balance of the year, we've kind of assumed that rates would flatten out after this quarter, after this second quarter and then trend down a bit towards the end of the year. Down a bit to something like 4.50% or so, so we may have one rate increase and then flat and then down to about 4.50%. That could change, but candidly, if it changes a little bit here or there, it's unlikely to have a meaningful impact in 2023. That's likely to have more of an impact in 2024. So we can debate that curve, but that's kind of what we have thus far in our outlook. And that’s US rates.",quarter,Mark Mason,CFO,18,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-14,Citigroup,transcript,"Mark Mason (CFO)

"The second point I'd make is around non-US rates. We're assuming, I don't have specifics in front of me in terms of the rate curves around the globe, but we are assuming continued rate increases there. Not of a significant magnitude, but some assumptions there depending on where we're talking about.",quarter,Mark Mason,CFO,18,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-14,Citigroup,transcript,"Mark Mason (CFO)

"The beta assumptions that we have built in are for betas to continue to increase outside of the US, but again, they run lower than the US in general for our multinational clients. We expect that we will see in the PBWM Retail Banking, or the PBWM client segment space that clients are likely to move towards either higher-yielding deposit products or investment products, and so we've factored those things into how we think about the outlook. And could that change or evolve? Absolutely. But that's kind of what's behind what we've assumed here.",quarter,Mark Mason,CFO,18,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-14,Citigroup,transcript,"Mark Mason (CFO)

"So a couple things I mentioned. So one, we did see inflows in the quarter associated with some of the sector turmoil. We've looked at kind of deposit levels from call it March 7th, March 8th through close to the end of March, and we certainly did see an uptick, call it probably a little bit under $30 billion or so of inflows in that period of time, with a good portion of that in our CCB, our Commercial Middle-Market client base.",quarter,Mark Mason,CFO,18,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-14,Citigroup,transcript,"Mark Mason (CFO)

"It's too soon to tell kind of how betas evolve, but we do think that a good portion of those deposits will likely be sticky. I think what's important here is that part of our strategy here is in fact growing operating deposits with our large multinational clients and our middle-market clients, and so we're going to continue to be focused on that.",quarter,Mark Mason,CFO,18,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-14,Citigroup,transcript,"Mark Mason (CFO)

"Thanks. Hey, Mark, just a follow-up on the credit. So you mentioned obviously that you moved your part of your CECL adjustment a little bit in your weightings, and you had previously talked about getting towards normalized card losses, I think you'd said by around the end of the year. So can you just given the changes that we're seeing ahead of us and definitely saw some normalization happen this quarter, can you just, are you still on line for that getting to that 3-3.5% and 5-5.5% in the respective card businesses by around year-end this year?",quarter,Ken Usdin,Analyst,19,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-14,Citigroup,transcript,"Ken Usdin (Analyst)

"Okay, cool. And then one more just follow-up. End-of-period deposits down 3%, you mentioned the taxes. Are the taxes, is the tax impact felt across the business? When I look at the deposits page, there are a lot of ins and there are a lot of outs on an end-of-period basis, and just trying to get a sense of like what areas might have been impacted by that tax seasonality and where there was just some of the other pieces that you've already talked through in terms of inflows, outflows, and everything else in between.",quarter,Ken Usdin,Analyst,19,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-14,Citigroup,transcript,"Ken Usdin (Analyst)

"Yeah, it's a good question. So, again, when you look at our deposits on an average basis, you see on page 26 that they tick up a little bit. If you look at it on an end of period basis, they're down about 3%, and essentially, intra-quarter, particularly in March as I mentioned earlier, we did see a sizable increase in flows. With that said, if you remember in the fourth quarter, we saw a nice run-up in deposits, and then we have the seasonality point that I referenced in my prepared remarks where we have both operational payments from our large TTS clients as well as tax payments with our TTS clients, also with Wealth clients to some extent kind of playing through the end-of-period deposits.

That's the stickiness and that's where you said 80% of your clients in TTS have been with you for over 15 years.",quarter,Mike Mayo,Analyst,20,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-14,Citigroup,transcript,"Mike Mayo (Analyst)

"What if the deposits for those 5,000 multinationals, and I know I'm asking you to slice and dice in a little bit different way, but even just a general sense, because the reason I'm asking this is because I think there's a disconnect between showing percent of uninsured deposits as a measure of stickiness, and I don't think that's valid, and you've showed higher deposits even though you have a big percentage of uninsured deposits or maybe that doesn't matter as much as some front pages of newspapers are suggesting, so if you could address that.",quarter,Mike Mayo,Analyst,20,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-14,Citigroup,transcript,"Mike Mayo (Analyst)

"Yeah, thanks, Mike. Look, I'd tell you to turn to page 26 in the earnings presentation. We've broken down the deposits for each of the businesses that we have, and at the bottom, you see the TTS deposits, and this is where the 5,000 or so large multinational client deposits reside, and you can see the stability, as well as the steady growth in those deposits over time. And to your point, these are largely operational deposits that these clients have with us, and we shouldn't mistake rate sensitivity or betas with stickiness, right, and it's because these deposits tend to be quite sticky with us, as you can see here.",quarter,Mark Mason,CFO,20,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-14,Citigroup,transcript,"Mark Mason (CFO)
Citigroup, Q1, 2023 Earnings Call Transcript, Page 20"
"Now, they're price-sensitive in the sense that as rates go up, we often have to reprice those. But remember, the relationships we have with these clients are broader than just deposit relationships, and that's what gives us the opportunity to adjust pricing accordingly with our deposits both in the US and outside of the US. And so the other page, in your own time you can look at it is the page prior to that which again speaks to the diversification of the portfolio but it also speaks to the length of time that many of these clients have been with us and have grown with us, and so nearly 80% of our deposits are from clients that have a greater than 15 year relationship with us, and that says a lot. And so anyway, those are the two points I'd make.

"On slide 6, we show financial results for the full firm. In the first quarter, we reported net income of approximately $3.4 billion, EPS of $1.58 and an RoTCE of 7.6% on $21.1 billion of revenues. Total revenues were down 2% on a reported basis. Excluding divestiture-related impacts, largely consisting of the $1 billion gain from the sale of the India consumer business in the prior year, revenues were up more than 3%, driven by growth across Banking, USPB and Services, partially offset by declines in Markets and Wealth. Expenses were $14.2 billion, up 7%, on a reported basis. Excluding divestiture-related impacts and the incremental FDIC special assessment, expenses were up 5%. Cost of credit was approximately $2.4 billion, primarily driven by higher Card net credit losses, which were partially offset by ACL releases in Wealth, Banking and Legacy Franchises. At the end of the quarter, we had nearly $22 billion in total reserves with a reserve-to-funded loans ratio of approximately 2.8%.",quarter,Mark Mason,CFO,4,Prepared remarks,Q1_2024,2024-04-12,Citigroup,transcript,"Mark Mason (CFO)

"On slide 7, we show the expense trend over the past five quarters. We reported expenses of $14.2 billion, which included the incremental FDIC special assessment of roughly $250 million. Also included in this number are $225 million of restructuring charges largely related to the organizational simplification. In total, we’ve incurred approximately $1 billion of restructuring costs over the last two quarters. As part of these actions, we expect approximately $1.5 billion of annualized run-rate saves over the medium term related to a headcount reduction of approximately 7,000. In addition to the restructuring, we took approximately $260 million of repositioning costs largely related to our efficiency efforts across the firm, including the reduction of stranded costs associated with the consumer divestitures. The expected savings from these actions will allow us to continue to fund additional investments in the Transformation this year. And relative to the prior year, the remainder of the expense growth was largely driven by inflation and volume-related expenses, partially offset by productivity savings. In the remainder of the year, we expect a more normalized level of repositioning, which is already embedded in our guidance. Therefore, you can expect our quarterly expense trend to go down from here in line with our $53.5-$53.8 billion ex-FDIC expense guidance.",quarter,Mark Mason,CFO,4,Prepared remarks,Q1_2024,2024-04-12,Citigroup,transcript,"Mark Mason (CFO)

In the first quarter, net interest income decreased by $317 million, largely driven by Markets, which resulted in a 4 basis point decrease in net interest margin. Excluding Markets, net interest income was relatively flat. Average loans were up $4 billion, primarily driven by Loans in Spread Products in Markets, as well as Card and Mortgage loans in US Personal Banking, partially offset by declines in Services.

And we remain well reserved with a reserve-to-funded loan ratio of 8.2% for our total card portfolio. In our Corporate portfolio, the majority of our exposure is investment grade, which is reflected in our low level of non-accrual loans at 0.5% of total corporate loans. As a reminder, our loan loss reserves incorporate a scenario-weighted average unemployment rate of approximately 5%, which includes a downside scenario unemployment rate of close to 7%.

Third, we saw an increase in our disallowed DTA, which resulted in a 10 basis point decrease. And finally, the remaining 6 basis point benefit was largely driven by a reduction in RWA. We ended the quarter with a preliminary 13.5% CET1 capital ratio, approximately 120 basis points, or over $13 billion, above our regulatory capital requirement of 12.3%.

Expenses increased 11%, largely driven by continued investments in technology and product innovation. Cost of credit was $64 million as net credit losses remain low. Net income was approximately $1.5 billion. Average loans were up 4%, primarily driven by strong demand for working capital loans in TTS. Average deposits were down 3% as the impact of quantitative tightening more than offset new client acquisitions and deepening with existing clients.

"Expenses were roughly flat due to lower compensation costs, including repositioning, offset by higher volume-related expenses.

In Branded Cards, the NCL rate came in at 3.65%, in line with our expectations. In Retail Services, the NCL rate of 6.32% was slightly above the high end of our guidance range for the full year and will likely remain above the range in the second quarter, reflecting historical seasonality patterns. However, given the persistent inflation, higher interest rates and continued sales pressure at our partners, we now expect to be closer to the high end of the full year NCL guidance range for Retail Services.

We have accomplished a lot over the past few years and have made substantial progress on simplifying our business and organizational structure. The year is off to a good start as we are laser focused on executing the Transformation and enhancing the business performance. These two priorities will not only enable us to be a more efficient, agile company, but a client-centric one that brings together the best of Citi to drive revenue growth and improve returns. And we are on the path to reach our 11-12% return target over the medium-term.",quarter,Mark Mason,CFO,7,Prepared remarks,Q1_2024,2024-04-12,Citigroup,transcript,"Mark Mason (CFO)

"Hi. Well, you just finished your seventh month of your org simplification and you said 7,000 positions go away, with $1.5 billion of expense savings. So that's very concrete, but more generally, after 20, 30, 40 years of matrix structure down to five lines of business, you're reporting these differently, you're talking about them differently, but the question that I think a lot of people have is, are you simply reporting these lines of business differently, or are you actually running them differently?

"Thank you, Mike, for the question. The simplification that we've just gone through, it is what we said it is. It is the most consequential set of changes, not only to the organization model that we have but how we run the bank. It's aligned the structure with the strategy. It's simplified the bank. It's eliminated needless complexity. It's created greater transparency into the five businesses and their performance as you can see. It's increased accountability. And very simply, it's just easier for our people to focus on our clients, but also getting things done and the execution that we have ahead of us.",quarter,Jane Fraser,CEO,7,Q and A,Q1_2024,2024-04-12,Citigroup,transcript,"Jane Fraser (CEO)

"So maybe if I try and bring this a bit more alive, the first thing we did was we elevated the five businesses and that eliminated the ICG and PBWM layer, and we brought all the elements that the businesses needed to run end-to-end under the direct management of those five business heads, an example being operations. It's enabled transparency, greater accountability, and this end-to-end and total P&L focus, so focus on the bottom line and the returns driving growth, expense discipline, etcetera.",quarter,Jane Fraser,CEO,8,Q and A,Q1_2024,2024-04-12,Citigroup,transcript,"Jane Fraser (CEO)

"So, by eliminating the regional layer and putting in a far slimmer, lighter management structure in place in the geographies, that's enabled us to make sure that our countries are focused on client delivery and legal entity management, and we've eliminated the whole shadow geographic P&L. We've eliminated a large number of committees in the geographies, and this is where a lot of the functional and management roles were streamlined and eliminated through the last seven months. And we also broke the regions into smaller, lighter clusters, and that allows us to much better capture the big changes in trade flows and financial flows, etcetera we're seeing around the world.

"The spans and layers, if you exclude me, 98% of the firm now operates within eight layers. That is a much, much faster decision-making, it's much quicker to get execution done. It also means that you can very quickly get close to where the engine room of the firm is. We've got clearer accountabilities. We've eliminated most co-heads. We've reduced matrix reporting.

"As you think about the guidance we talked about for this year, we talked about the NII ex-Markets being down modestly. And so what that means is that the momentum and the growth that we expect is going to come from the non-interest revenue. And I think this quarter is a good example of where and how that's likely to play through, so the revenue top line being up 3-plus percent, but when you look through each of the businesses, and if you look on each of the pages where we disclose the revenue, you can see the underlying NIR growth in the bottom left hand corner of each of those pages, that's coming through as well. So Services up 14% with growth in both TTS, between cross-border, clearing, commercial cards, but also – and Securities Services, right, with the growth that we're seeing from continued momentum in assets under custody. We expect that trend to continue with existing clients and new clients as well as how we do more with our commercial market – commercial middle market business, excuse me.

There is still some investment in there in technology and in the platform that's important. But I think coming out of the first quarter, you'll start to see some of the reduction in expenses that's a by-product of that work.

We have run at about 13.5% this quarter. That does give us capacity above the 13.3%. But it's important to keep in mind that there's client demand that will continue to evolve.

"How are you balancing – clearly, your valuation would demand that the buybacks be ramped up from $500 million. But growing revenues at a 4% to 5% CAGR would mean potentially some capital plowed back into the business. I guess how are you balancing that, especially given that the demand for buyback is louder at Citi than any other money center peer? And could you give us a sense of what card late fees are and how that would impact the $80 billion to $81 billion for the year if we do get an earlier implementation than October?",quarter,Erika Najarian,Analyst,12,Q and A,Q1_2024,2024-04-12,Citigroup,transcript,"Erika Najarian (Analyst)

"It's why I've given you a range around the expenses, at least in part. It's why I've continued to stress the importance of protecting the Transformation and risk and control spend. And it's why I started the answer to Ebrahim's question by saying that we want to be sure that we can match the client demand out there, where the returns to do so makes sense. And so, we are having to balance kind of the use of capital and other resources against that longer term strategic objective and utilize it where it makes sense and generates good returns against the idea of returning that to shareholders.",quarter,Mark Mason,CFO,12,Q and A,Q1_2024,2024-04-12,Citigroup,transcript,"Mark Mason (CFO)

"And so, we'll continue to do that. It's an everyday assessment. It's an everyday discussion with the teams.

We've talked about how we expect for the cost of credit to normalize, and we've seen that continue to happen. The range that we've given on Branded Cards, we're inside of that range. When you look at the spend across the portfolios, the spend is really happening with the affluent customers more so than anything else. And so, we're watching the lower income customer profile – or customers that we have.

"Where we're really seeing the pressure is where I mentioned in terms of Retail Services. And so, there, the current NCLs are higher than the high-end of the full year range that I've given. But if you look back, that is not inconsistent with seasonality that we've seen in the past in that portfolio, where the first two quarters are higher than the back half of the year, in part because of coming out of the holiday season and how losses tend to mature or materialize through that process.",quarter,Mark Mason,CFO,13,Q and A,Q1_2024,2024-04-12,Citigroup,transcript,"Mark Mason (CFO)

But look, the reality is that we continue to watch it, and the factors that are out there that are important include how unemployment evolves, what happens with inflation, what happens with interest rates, and those will be important factors as to how the loss rates continue to evolve over time.",quarter,Mark Mason,CFO,13,Q and A,Q1_2024,2024-04-12,Citigroup,transcript,"Mark Mason (CFO)

"I think the final point I'd make and I mentioned it in the prepared remarks is that we have to remember that the loss rates in both portfolios reflect kind of multiple vintages maturing at the same time.

"And now coming out of that, we're seeing the COVID vintages mature, albeit at a lagged pace from what would be normal, and we're seeing the incremental acquisitions that we've done start to mature at their normal pace. And so, these loss rates are exacerbated by that impact and that's an important factor we can't lose sight of. But the bottom line is that we're watching it. The macro factors matter.

"Yeah, sure. Look, I think that when I think about the reserve builds, I think it's the same factors that come into play. So, obviously, the view on the macro is important. And right now, if you think about some of the key macro factors that impact the cards portfolio, the unemployment assumptions weighted is about 5%, the downside is about 7% kind of weighted over the period. And so, how that evolves will be an important factor. How HPI evolves would be an important consideration here for this portfolio, but also what happens with volumes becomes a factor on reserve builds and how important or how much they increase or decrease.",quarter,Mark Mason,CFO,14,Q and A,Q1_2024,2024-04-12,Citigroup,transcript,"Mark Mason (CFO)

"And then the final piece is mix, and it's kind of related to that revolver point. As we see the mix evolve from transactors to revolvers, that's going to play into how much of a reserve from a lifetime point of view we have to continue to build. And so, it's why I mentioned on John's question the importance of looking at the interest rates, looking at what's happening with inflation, watching the lower income customer base, because all of those things combined with how we think about the scenarios and the weighting will be a factor on the reserves.",quarter,Mark Mason,CFO,14,Q and A,Q1_2024,2024-04-12,Citigroup,transcript,"Mark Mason (CFO)

"Sure, yeah. I mean, I think I'd say a couple things. We do have kind of some Argentina playing through the NII line. I will say that the best way to think about it is kind of the underlying beta activity. And we have seen, this is the corporate client, it is an institutional client. We have seen betas, particularly in the US, at kind of normalized or terminal levels and playing a bit through that.

The last point I'd make on this is, we will continue to drive and see growth as it relates to the operating deposits, and that will be an important tailwind that kind of plays through.",quarter,Mark Mason,CFO,14,Q and A,Q1_2024,2024-04-12,Citigroup,transcript,"Mark Mason (CFO)

"Yeah, look, there's a mix obviously of things that are driving that net income, including a tax impact on the heels of last year Argentina devaluation activity that's in that line. But the short answer is that if you think about the nature of the business that we do in Argentina, it is a big part of our institutional client relationships. And the primary activities include some of the TTS-type of activities that we've talked about, so liquidity management, payments, custody within the Services business. And so, you'd see a good portion of the activity in Argentina playing through the Services business, some of it in Markets as well, but again, the majority of the activity in Services.",quarter,Mark Mason,CFO,14,Q and A,Q1_2024,2024-04-12,Citigroup,transcript,"Mark Mason (CFO)

So one is, if I think about how the rate implieds have evolved from the 3 to 6 to now something a little bit north of 1 in the context of what I expect for our performance, it doesn't have a material impact on the guidance that I've given of $80 billion to $81 billion.",quarter,Mark Mason,CFO,15,Q and A,Q1_2024,2024-04-12,Citigroup,transcript,"Mark Mason (CFO)

"And in part, that's because as I think about the timing for the planned cuts, which was generally back-loaded, as well as some of the other factors that play through. So, you know, Argentina just announced a policy rate reduction yesterday or a couple of days ago. If rates are a bit higher for longer, we'll watch how the betas continue to evolve. I mentioned earlier, the late fees for the cards business happened a bit sooner. Late fees are actually booked in our NII line. And so, those factors put me in a place where I feel like there will certainly be puts and takes around how that rate curve evolves, and therefore I'm very comfortable kind of leaving the guidance where it is.",quarter,Mark Mason,CFO,15,Q and A,Q1_2024,2024-04-12,Citigroup,transcript,"Mark Mason (CFO)

I guess if the facts on the ground were to change, would you be open to a sale potentially being back on the table, because it does seem like this is a situation where a private market valuation could be higher and even materially higher than the public market valuation.",quarter,Saul Martinez,Analyst,17,Q and A,Q1_2024,2024-04-12,Citigroup,transcript,"Saul Martinez (Analyst)

"The guiding principle that we have and we've had all along is making sure that we make a decision here that is in the best interest of our shareholders and makes the most sense for them. We are – we never say never, but we are very focused on the IPO path here. We believe it is the right one for our shareholders. We're well on track in the path in Mexico. We're very pleased to bring Ignacio Deschamps in as the Banamex Chairman to help guide the IPO process. We announced the management teams for the two banks earlier this quarter. We're far down the path of the technological separation of both banks, and then the full legal separation in the second half of the year.",quarter,Jane Fraser,CEO,17,Q and A,Q1_2024,2024-04-12,Citigroup,transcript,"Jane Fraser (CEO)

The macro scenario, Fed assumptions look quite similar to last year but just given the significant transformation that's underway, repositioning actions, which admittedly depressed earnings last year, want to get a sense as to whether there are any idio-factors that could result in greater SCB volatility in the coming exam and just broader thoughts on longer-term trajectory for the SCB, just given the org simplification efforts that are underway.",quarter,Steven Chubak,Analyst,18,Q and A,Q1_2024,2024-04-12,Citigroup,transcript,"Steven Chubak (Analyst)

"Yeah, Steven the first part of your question is just impossible to answer to be candid with you, right. I mean it's – we obviously have an internal based scenario we've run. We have a severely adverse scenario that we've run. We've provided a balance sheet as part of the submission, but ultimately, the regulators have to run through their models, the information that we've provided and that informs what happens with the stress capital buffer, and we don't have as much transparency to that as we'd like and so really hard to call at this stage.",quarter,Mark Mason,CFO,18,Q and A,Q1_2024,2024-04-12,Citigroup,transcript,"Mark Mason (CFO)

"The second part of your question I think is spot-on and I kind of alluded to in my prepared remarks in that we have the medium-term targets that we've set and we're still in the midst of kind of the execution of our strategy, the evolution of the business mix and the business model. The mix towards more consistent, predictable and repeatable revenue streams that would impact PPNR, the simplification which obviously plays through an expense base that'll be lower when we get to that medium-term period.",quarter,Mark Mason,CFO,18,Q and A,Q1_2024,2024-04-12,Citigroup,transcript,"Mark Mason (CFO)

"Hi. Mark, completely different topic, because I think I understood your answer to be just – from my previous question to be the tax benefits so we'll leave it at that. If it's different then I need to go down that path, but the question I signed on to ask was, you talked about the percentage of revolvers increasing from transactors in the private-label and the retail partner cards.

"Yeah, I don't – we haven't broken down the transactor versus revolver mix, and so I'm not going to get into that. I will say that the revolver levels are at least back to where they were pre-pandemic and leave it at that, but we are seeing kind of continued revolver activity which you'd expect kind of given the way the cycle has evolved and given payment rates have started to moderate and the stimulus has kind of unwound, and so all of that is kind of consistent with expectations but obviously, is a factor in reserve levels as I mentioned earlier.",quarter,Mark Mason,CFO,19,Q and A,Q1_2024,2024-04-12,Citigroup,transcript,"Mark Mason (CFO)

"Oh, hi, thanks so much. I just wanted to make sure of one thing on the expenses. I know in the past you've talked about the fact that 1Q will be a little elevated with the restructuring. And you showed that was the $225 million in the quarter, and then when we look to 2Q, we should – should we still be expecting a step-down in 2Q? And is that step-down just the elimination of the $225 million or is there some restructuring that we're likely to see in 2Q as well? In other words, should I just fade sequentially 2Q, 3Q, 4Q to hit your annual number or is there a bigger step-down in 2Q that I should still be expecting here?

"Sure. I think you should just fade it, to answer your question very directly, but I'd also point out that in Q1, if you really look through to it, it has the $250 million of FDIC charge in it, and so when you back that out, we effectively are coming in lower than what we had guided right. Despite that I'm telling you the same – I'm making the same point, which is you can expect a downward trend from here through to the end of the year and while there won't be additional restructuring charge, there will be the normal BAU activity around repositioning that plays through, so hopefully that answers your question, Betsy. The guidance still holds, and the downward trend is what we are managing towards, as we kind of play out the balance of the year.",quarter,Mark Mason,CFO,19,Q and A,Q1_2024,2024-04-12,Citigroup,transcript,"Mark Mason (CFO)

"Hi, thanks very much. So, I know it's early, but I'm curious if you could help us with a refresher on Treasury and Trade Solutions and Services in general. In terms of what opportunities there's risk, but also opportunities in helping clients manage through this re-tariffing and redrawing of economic lines. I think about nationalization and vertical integration as bad things, but a lot of shifting, and maybe you can help clients deal with all that shifting.

"Glenn, I would be delighted to do so. So, our diversified business mix is very well positioned for a variety of scenarios. We think we've got a very broad suite of products and services. And they are the ones that clients need if they're going to be repositioning for a new order in trade or broader impacts here. And think about what you've seen over the last few years where we played a very central role: the Ukraine- Russia war, China, the COVID-related supply chains. We saw a lot of growth from deepening with clients and acquiring new ones because they need us, because we have exactly the expertise and the products and services that multinational institutions need, and we have them in the places that they need it. Now, the mix of those different revenues, different products and services we have could be different depending on which scenario prevails. And what I have to say at the moment, the level of engagement that we have with our clients all around the world, is just off the charts, given the unique depth of our presence and the insights we have in all the markets.",quarter,Jane Fraser,CEO,5,Q and A,Q1_2025,2025-04-15,Citigroup,transcript,"Jane Fraser (CEO)

"So, if I dig down a bit more, what would the persistence of high tariffs, what would it mean? Well, it would dampen economic activity here in the in the U.S. and abroad. Cross-border trade flows will change, we'll be in the middle of facilitating that. So, we expect to be very busy there along with the hedging and associated financing activity that goes with it because it's not just about TTS. This is about the bundle of different capabilities we bring to bear. And take some comfort, look at what happened with the Ukraine war. We grew a lot in that time period. Equally, most of our business is very local. Think of what Services is, it's payroll, it's supplier management, it's liquidity, it's payables, it's receivables. And we're very deeply embedded into our clients' day-to-day operations in every market they work in as well as across market flows. And that's not going to change. It's not nearly as sensitive to tariffs. And I would say, I think all of us recognize the environment is very fluid right now. So let me also just say for clarity sake, at the firmwide level, our RoTCE targets for 2026 are still 10% to 11%. The drivers behind them are the same, but the revenue mix might be different. We'll certainly know more as things get clearer as to how that plays out.",quarter,Jane Fraser,CEO,6,Q and A,Q1_2025,2025-04-15,Citigroup,transcript,"Jane Fraser (CEO)

"I think actually the other thing you mentioned about nationalization. Most of our clients have been clients for decades. I mean, a number of them have been clients for over a century. And it would not be British understatement to say that we are deeply embedded into them. I mean, it is extraordinary how deep we are. We've been on the ground for over a century, and we are viewed as quasi-local in most of these markets. Citi is not a bunch of suitcase bankers that fly in. We're not transactional.

"And then the team has been very, very engaged as it relates to deposit repricing and managing beta through the current environment. So, the combination of those things, along with the removal of the reduction of late fees are really tailwinds that contribute to that 2% to 3% growth, and then there's some headwinds. So lower rates on floating rate assets would be a [headwind]. The potential of FX translation, primarily in Mexico would be a [headwind], but net-net, I feel good about the 2% to 3% growth in NII ex-Markets.",quarter,Mark Mason,CFO,7,Q and A,Q1_2025,2025-04-15,Citigroup,transcript,"Mark Mason (CFO)

"Hi, I just wanted to continue the discussion about, on one hand you’re a port in the storm. You've been embedded decades and you're not a bunch of suitcase bankers. So that message has landed. On the other hand, I mean, you are the bank that facilitates global trade in the middle of a global trade war. And so, I think the concern is not just the possibility that that revenues will nosedive, but credit will implode or as I've heard many, many times that Citigroup is going to stub its toe, just 100 countries in the mix of it all.

"So, you've seen us perform extremely well over the last few years in the face of pretty wrenching changes in the global economy. You’ve seen it with say, shifts in supply chains after COVID and then between the geopolitical tensions that are going on, you saw it in pretty significant changes that were happening from the Russia and Ukraine war. And you see us exactly as that, we are where the clients come, it's hedging for foreign exchange, interest rates, commodities, you see it for how they're looking at changing their financing around, and we tend to be the ones that are helping them reconfigure the flows. So, from that point of view, we are the active agent in a lot this mix. And we are a port in the storm as I said, Mike, we've got very strong balance sheet, capital and liquidity to deploy. We have the big strategic changes and organization changes behind us, and they're enabling us to be on the front foot. And this is a firm that is much more agile and able to respond and be much more focused on clients right now.

"Yes. The only thing I'd add, I mean, Jane, you're spot on, right. We come in with a strong balance sheet, strong capital, strong liquidity. If you think about your point around credit, Mike, we've said repeatedly, and you can see it in the numbers. We skew towards the higher investment grade, larger multinationals who also come into this with strong balance sheets. We've been very disciplined about that risk framework, our risk appetite, both on the corporate side as well as it relates to our consumers. And then what we tend to see in times of stress is a flight to quality as it relates to deposits. And so again, depending on how this evolves, we're well positioned to manage whatever the needs are of our clients, whether that be lending needs or the storing of liquidity, and we're very well reserved to manage whatever credit risk may come with that despite us being skewed towards higher quality names in both of those demographics.",quarter,Mark Mason,CFO,7,Q and A,Q1_2025,2025-04-15,Citigroup,transcript,"Mark Mason (CFO)

"I guess Mark, just wanted to on Slide 9 and the capital waterfall. I guess we are all thinking about what buybacks can do in the second half of this year. So, if you don't mind, one, the RWA sort of drag, the 32 basis points. Is that normal as we think about what the RWA consumption should look like? Just talk about that in the context of getting to a 13.1% CET1 by the end of the year. And how we can back into the pace of buybacks.",quarter,Ebrahim Poonawala,Analyst,8,Q and A,Q1_2025,2025-04-15,Citigroup,transcript,"Ebrahim Poonawala (Analyst)

"Yes. So, I'd say a couple of things. So one, last quarter, we announced a $20 billion share repurchase program. And we continue to feel good about that program, as you would expect. And we increased our buybacks this year, or this quarter, I should say, to the $1.75 billion, seeing the strength of the performance that was playing out through the quarter. And so those are both, I think, indications of our continued commitment to returning capital to the shareholders. We're clear on where we're trading, and we're clear that, that is a smart thing to do once we've funded demand from a client point of view across our businesses, that's accretive to returns. And so, the RWA consumption is tied to that demand that we see. We think we've seen good client demand across the platform that's helped drive the top line momentum that you see in each and every one of our businesses that's helped to drive the improved returns that you see in the quarter in each and every one of our businesses. And as we see that demand, again, accretive in returns, we'll be looking to meet that as a first priority. We are targeting the 13.1% [CET1 Capital ratio] by the end of the year. But as you know, we'll get a new stressed capital buffer in June on the heels of the DFAST/CCAR work that's just been submitted, and we'll have to see what that tells us. That's hard to forecast as you well know. And so based on what that tells us will inform that downward trajectory, but that is what we're focused on. The combination of funding growth that's accretive to returns and returning capital to shareholders in a way that's consistent with that repurchase program.",quarter,Mark Mason,CFO,8,Q and A,Q1_2025,2025-04-15,Citigroup,transcript,"Mark Mason (CFO)

"Understood. And I guess you mentioned, I think, in your prepared remarks, the reserves on the card book went up to 8.2%. Remind us, I mean, I think, and the genesis of both questions is I think there's a fragility to your RoTCE guidance for next year that I think makes investors nervous. And I'm just trying to get to the pieces around buybacks? And then in terms of credit, like how what's it baking in around the unemployment rate? What would cause you to ratchet up provisioning in the near term? What kind of an implied job market deterioration do we need to see for the credit outlook to deteriorate fast and materially?

"Yes. Let me take that in a couple of different pieces. So, the first thing I'd say is that as I look at our credit exposure and I look at the consumer, the consumer continues to be resilient and discerning in their spend. And in fact, we did see spend hold up in the quarter, and we saw spend actually increase in our Branded Cards portfolio, up about 3%. The consumer has - we've seen a shift towards essentials and away from travel and entertainment. There's certainly a general performance that's consistent with what we've expected when we look at delinquencies, when we look at the loss rates that played to through the quarter, there are no surprises there as we think about that.",quarter,Mark Mason,CFO,9,Q and A,Q1_2025,2025-04-15,Citigroup,transcript,"Mark Mason (CFO)

"When I look at the drivers of that, as you know, when we establish when we do our [CECL] analysis on a quarterly basis, we have three scenarios that we run. A host of other stress scenarios, but that inform the [CECL] analysis, there are three scenarios, the base case scenario, there's a downside scenario and there's an upside scenario.

In Markets we've talked about last year a lot about the revenue to RWA as a tool that we've been using there. That's continued to increase that metric and ratio. We continue to look at, are we optimizing balance sheet and getting the broader revenue streams we'd expect from our client base, when we do our corporate lending work and some of that is showing up in how we've now introduced the revenue sharing as a tool to ensure we're capturing broader revenues from clients when we are using balance sheet.

"In fact, as you look through the material we provided, you'll see that in light of the improvement we've seen across all of our businesses last year as well as our forecast for growth this year, there, in fact, is a shift in the TCE. And so, the allocated TCE has gone down for many of these businesses because they have shown good PPNR growth, good profitability. And so, as we stress test it internally, the stressed losses with the businesses have, in fact, come down. Now obviously, we have to adhere to the regulator stress test, and so that shifted from the businesses into Corporate/Other, but it is a positive sign as we think about how the stressed capital buffer might evolve and as we exit different parts of the franchise, the underlying segments are already showing that that improvement would suggest lower levels of stressed losses. And so that's another important point that we diligently manage even if we can't control the impact at the top of the house.",quarter,Mark Mason,CFO,9,Q and A,Q1_2025,2025-04-15,Citigroup,transcript,"Mark Mason (CFO)

We did see a pickup this quarter, which is really just a timing difference pickup. It happens in the first quarter of every year. It is tied to deferred compensation and loan loss reserves as timing difference DTA and as we earn more income through the balance of the year and obviously create income tax liability, it will utilize that increase we saw or offset that that increase we saw in the first quarter here.

The first half is usually seasonally higher than the back half of the year, and you see that in Retail Services. I would also point out that and you can see it in the deck and I think it's the second page of the appendix but also in the supplement, you are starting to see that delinquency buckets, we show the 90-day plus delinquency bucket starting to trend down in Retail Services, that is also an important indicator in terms of how we look at the expected losses, if you will, in the go forward.

"It does have an impact on the Retail Services print that we have in the quarter and more importantly, the year-over-year that you see there of down 11% because, as you know, we share profits with those partners. And so that that that down 11% we see in the quarter is informed by last year where we had an assumption that the late fee rule was going to come into play and therefore, we had less profit to share with our partners versus this year first quarter where we've assumed it would not come into play and, therefore, have more profits to share with our partners. And so important to point that out on Retail Services, which jumps out in USPB, that it's unlikely that we see that downward percentage in the remaining quarters because it's really a byproduct of what we assumed last year. versus this year on late fees.",quarter,Mark Mason,CFO,11,Q and A,Q1_2025,2025-04-15,Citigroup,transcript,"Mark Mason (CFO)

"I think I'd say, I guess the easiest way to answer the question is to point to the IRE analysis that we show on a quarterly basis. And there are a lot of - that's obviously a risk measure. There are a lot of limitations associated with taking it too deeply or taking it too literally, but as you know, it is a view on how lower rates could impact Citi over a 12-month period. It assumes a static balance sheet, no growth, no change in composition or mix or changes in our hedging actions. And it is an instantaneous shock to the entire curve. With that said, we do break out the impact for U.S. dollar versus non-U.S. dollar. Remember, as you just referenced, there are over 60 currencies, but that asset sensitivity would suggest with a - in the fourth quarter - with a 100-basis point move across the currencies that the non-U.S. dollar impact would be $1 billion over a 12-month period. And so that take that with a grain of salt, but that gives you some sense as to the sensitivity to rates, that would assume all of those currencies and rates in those countries moved at the same time across the curve, and we did nothing to actively manage or dynamically manage the balance sheet.",quarter,Mark Mason,CFO,13,Q and A,Q1_2025,2025-04-15,Citigroup,transcript,"Mark Mason (CFO)

"Hi Jane, Hi Mark. Mark, you touched on in your opening comments about the seasonal increase in trading-related assets. And then the growth was very strong. Was there any types of strategies that you guys employed? Because when you go back in other seasonal periods, first quarter of prior years, we've not seen this kind of growth.

"Yes. Again, it's the growth you've seen across the platform in both fixed income as well as equities and so that equities growth of 23% strong performance in derivatives in prime and prime balance growth tied to that particularly with hedge funds and asset managers as they looked at regional reallocation, strong contribution there. And then, rates and currencies, good increased client activity in portfolio trading. And then, we saw a lot of good spread product momentum driven by higher client activity and loan growth. And so, the nature of the activity, the structure of the products and what have you were all contributing factors there. Really strong performance across the business. And it obviously shows up in both the assets and the – the trading assets and the trading liabilities and the funding mechanisms associated with that.",quarter,Mark Mason,CFO,14,Q and A,Q1_2025,2025-04-15,Citigroup,transcript,"Mark Mason (CFO)

"So, in a way, they're getting the benefit of that improved resiliency even before it shows up in our Stress Capital Buffer, right? And so, each of the businesses, we talked about Markets as a great example. We've been talking about optimizing use of capital, revenue to RWA, and the improvement all last year. We talked about that.

I kind of went through the puts and takes around that. I'd expect probably a bit of a tick up in Q2 when I think about the things in front of us and some of the continued investments that we plan to make in transformation and some of the other things underneath that, like data and regulatory reporting. And then I'd expect it to trend down so that we get to the target of the $53.4 [billion] that I referenced for the full year.

"So, I'm very curious on the whole revenue to RWA topic, especially with some of the changes coming in. So maybe you could give a little more color on -- let's take, for instance, the further reduction in subscription credit facilities. I think I read somewhere that was like an $80 billion book down to $20 billion. You can correct that if that's wrong. But just usually, those things are big important clients that have relationship lending, things attached to them. So, I'm curious on how you balance the capital benefit, the clear capital benefit, versus client impact and how you think about that? Are there other blocks of business that are in motion right now?",quarter,Glenn Schorr,Analyst,8,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-14,Citigroup,transcript,"Glenn Schorr (Analyst)
Citigroup, Q2, 2023 Earnings Call Transcript, Page 8"
"Thanks Glenn and good morning, and thanks for the question. Look, a couple of points on that. One is we've been very focused on the revenue to RWA metric in our Markets business in the ICG more broadly as well. And we've made considerable progress on that. And that's important because how we use the balance sheet and ensuring that we're optimizing the use of the balance sheet contributes to how we improve returns over time.",quarter,Mark Mason,CFO,8,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-14,Citigroup,transcript,"Mark Mason (CFO)
Citigroup, Q2, 2023 Earnings Call Transcript, Page 8"
"You're right to point out the subscription facility, credit facility, lending that we do. We brought that down pretty significantly. The numbers you highlight are a lot higher than the portfolio. But what's important here is that as we look at that, we look at a couple of things. So, one, the nature of relationship and whether clients are taking advantage of the breadth of what we have to offer. Two, the profitability and returns associated with the product to the extent that it is in a broader relationship, and where those returns are low, subpar, and the prospect for doing more has proven to be fruitless, we take it down. And that's what we've done with a large part of that book, just as we juxtapose it against other opportunities to use balance sheet where clients are taking advantage of the broader franchise and therefore, are generating higher returns.",quarter,Mark Mason,CFO,8,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-14,Citigroup,transcript,"Mark Mason (CFO)
Citigroup, Q2, 2023 Earnings Call Transcript, Page 8"
"And we're going to continue to do that. We've done that to drive the revenue to RWA metric. We've done it selectively on pieces of the portfolio like SCF. We've also looked at our broader corporate lending portfolio and where those promises for higher relationship returns aren't manifesting themselves, we've not renewed those loans. And as we think about pending regulatory changes, proactively making these efforts becomes critically important. When I look back on the activity that we've done over the past couple of years, we've reduced RWA by approximately $120 billion over the last 2 years, and about 75% of that is predominantly driven by balance sheet optimization and looking at client activity that has low margin business. And so, this is important for us to do and to keep doing.",quarter,Mark Mason,CFO,8,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-14,Citigroup,transcript,"Mark Mason (CFO)

"I appreciate that, Mark. Maybe just a quick follow-up. On NII, I asked this last quarter too. And your first half annualized ex-Markets is running about $1.5 billion ahead of the guide. Is that just unpredictable nature all the moving parts, trying to be conservative or anything else in the back half that you're thinking about?",quarter,Glenn Schorr,Analyst,8,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-14,Citigroup,transcript,"Glenn Schorr (Analyst)

"Thanks, Glenn. We did take guidance up to slightly above $46 billion from the $45 billion. I guess there are a couple of things, and that’s ex-Markets, of course. There are a couple of things to think about in terms of headwinds and tailwinds that play through there. One is you've heard me mention before that we've reached terminal betas in the U.S. Two, deposit volumes and the shift mix as we see consumers kind of move into higher-returning type, higher-yielding type products. And three, really the wind-downs and the exits and the reduction that they will play out in terms of NII. So those are kind of 3 headwinds as we think about the forecast and the balance of year. There are obviously some potential tailwinds that play to the other side, including rate movements in non-U.S. dollar as well as Card volume growth. And as we look at those headwinds and tailwinds, our current read is to take it up, but $46 billion or slightly above that feels like the right level in the context of total revenues at $78 billion to $79 billion.",quarter,Mark Mason,CFO,9,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-14,Citigroup,transcript,"Mark Mason (CFO)

"Thank you. Let me take that. I'd say a couple of things. So, one, I'd reiterate the expense guidance that we've given for the full year. So that's the roughly $54 billion ex-divestitures, or the impact of divestitures, ex-any impact from FDIC special assessment. Two, as we think about bending the curve, I look into 2024 and we're looking to bring the absolute expense dollars down from Q3 to Q4. So that bending of the curve will occur. It will occur despite having Mexico still part of the franchise. And obviously still having Mexico impacts the magnitude of the bend, but it will bend Q3 to Q4.",quarter,Mark Mason,CFO,9,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-14,Citigroup,transcript,"Mark Mason (CFO)

"And then beyond that and through the medium term, we will see the curve continue to bend. Again, Mexico impacts the magnitude of the bend, but we're very, very focused on bringing our costs down and bending that curve. And you've heard us reference the aspects or the elements of our business that help contribute to that, not the least of which are the exits, one of which is Mexico, and you referenced the timing there, but also the benefits from investments that we've been making in transformation and risk controls and shifting from manual processes to technology-enabled ones.",quarter,Mark Mason,CFO,9,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-14,Citigroup,transcript,"Mark Mason (CFO)

"So just as a follow-up, is the way to think about sort of 2025 and beyond as you get through a lot the automation on the sort of the non-legacy businesses and start to get much more efficient there. Is there an absolute expense decline story in the core business?

"I'd highlight a couple of things that I'm sure are obvious to you, Betsy. One is this is the stress capital buffer for the 12-month period starting October 1. And two is the strategy that we've described and talked about and have started to execute against is intentionally designed to help morph the business towards a more steady, predictable, consistent stream of revenues, fee revenue growth as well bring our expenses down over time, and exit these markets, and those things should contribute to reducing our stress capital buffer over time and improving our returns.

It's a very high-returning business and some of the indicators of how we're monetizing those relationships. We're seeing it both in terms of new client wins, they were up 41% this quarter.

One is the buyback given your tangible book values at $85 and the and the stock at $46 other is the spending the curve on expenses. So let me just ask Jim's question another way. In looking back to 2017, and I'm just looking at 2017 because I can break out legacy and core that way. And fast forward to 2022, you produced revenues ex Legacy Franchises about $61 billion in 2017 and about $67 billion in 2022.

"Yes, sure. Look, no need to apologize for asking the question again, it's an important topic. I'd say a couple of things. So, one is that we can certainly look back in time, but I would highlight that we're here because we needed to have invested more in our franchise.

It doesn't put a big dent in our ability to bring stranded costs down and by the way, it does come with top line revenues and historically has been accretive to our profitability and returns.",quarter,Mark Mason,CFO,12,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-14,Citigroup,transcript,"Mark Mason (CFO)

But what I will point you to is not only the $54 billion this year, roughly $54 billion this year, not only the bending of the curve in the third and fourth quarter or the third to the fourth quarter next year. But we've given guidance on top line growth, revenue of 5% call it CAGR through that medium-term period, and we've given you kind of operating efficiency targets that we've said as well, and we intend to deliver on those things that reflect the bending of that curve through all of those drivers that we've mentioned.",quarter,Mark Mason,CFO,12,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-14,Citigroup,transcript,"Mark Mason (CFO)

"So, I hope that helps, Erika. I appreciate the focus on both capital and expenses. We are equally focused on it and know just how important it is to achieving those targets. We're not only kind of doing the things that we've highlighted in that strategy articulation, but we're also being responsive to the current environment that we're in. We think that aids in our ability to deliver the targets and the bending of the curve, and we know there's an additional opportunity that Jane has referenced to the simplification of the organization as we make -- what I would argue is considerable progress on the exits towards the end of this year.

"And just a follow-up on that. I guess, you guys have been you guys have been pretty clear on the timing, and pretty clear on why the curve will bend. I guess I'm wondering, is it just a timing issue that you're not giving us the sort of the dollar numbers that could go away from the transformation? Is it just a timing issue? Or are you still at a point where you don't know how much of that you would need to reinvest to arrive at that 5% revenue CAGR?",quarter,Erika Najarian,Analyst,12,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-14,Citigroup,transcript,"Erika Najarian (Analyst)

"Expenses. So, we get loud and clear why the curve will bend. We get loud and clear when the curve will bend, right? And there's clearly just expenses there that are catch-up expenses that are transformational expenses to everything that Jane talked about. And that message has been loud and clear. And I'm wondering if you haven't told us what could come out of those expenses because it's just a timing issue, it's July 14th versus 4Q'24? Or have you not yet made decisions in terms of how you may allocate those expenses in terms of do you need some of those expenses that could come out to grow your revenue base to that 5% CAGR versus having it fall to the bottom line?

"Yes. So, I'd say a couple of things. So, one, Erika, is obviously, with that revenue CAGR will be volume-related expenses that play out. But we're also focused, obviously, on the non-volume-related expenses and not giving you a precise number because the magnitude of that bend, right, is a factor, right?",quarter,Mark Mason,CFO,13,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-14,Citigroup,transcript,"Mark Mason (CFO)

"So obviously, Mexico, for example, as I mentioned earlier, impacts the magnitude of the bend, right?

"And so, there are going to be nuances in the running of the business in a way that ensures we're maximizing shareholder value that impacts the magnitude of the bending of that that expense curve. Investments that I’ve got to continue to make in in TTS order to maintain that #1 position and that that competitive advantage we have. And so those things will impact that magnitude of the bend. We've been, I think, very transparent as we get into each year, giving you concrete numbers. What I'm telling you is the curve will bend.

"Wanted to ask a question on capital. Just given the recent increase in your SCB, I was hoping to better understand why the 11.5% to 12% remains the appropriate long-term objective in your mind? And as we prepare for Basel III endgame, think through the capital benefit from future asset sales, can you speak to whether that will translate into operational risk capital relief specifically as it's less clear whether those benefits will accrete even as those asset sales are consummated?",quarter,Steven Chubak,Analyst,13,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-14,Citigroup,transcript,"Steven Chubak (Analyst)

"One, it's the revenues that we expect to grow by 4% to 5% CAGR as we continue to execute on the strategy. On expenses, it's the clear path to bend the curve by the end 2024, bringing those expenses down over the medium term. And third and importantly, it's continuing to optimize our balance sheet, including improving RWA and capital efficiency. And as we referenced earlier in the prepared remarks, different drivers in that, that are helpful, exiting 14 international consumer markets, changing our business mix. And I'd also note that the transformation has benefits not only for our efficiency, but it will also support RWA and capital optimization.",quarter,Jane Fraser,CEO,13,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-14,Citigroup,transcript,"Jane Fraser (CEO)

"That said, there's uncertainty around the future capital requirements in the industry and importantly, the timing of their implementation. We like everyone again to have to work through those implications once we know what they are. But as we said, keep in mind, we've got some other levers to pull over time, capital allocation, DTA allocation and utilization, our G-SIB score and our management buffer of 100 basis points.

"Sure. And again, I think that if you look at the transactions that we've closed to date, they've generated or freed up about $4.6 billion of capital the two that remain to be closed and the balance of year will generate another $1.2 billion or so.

"There's clearly going to be reference to increases in RWA and operational risk implications potentially as part of that. I do think that exiting, without having seen the proposal, and without obviously knowing how those rules might evolve. I do believe that the exiting of these 14 markets does play towards not only reducing our SCB in stress scenarios or as it comes out of stress analysis and tests, but also should play through helping to reduce risk-weighted assets and potentially operational risk as well.

"And I feel compelled to jump in here as well because as the spring and the recent test results showed the large U.S. banks are not only in a strong capital position, but we've been able to play an important stabilizing role for the system as a whole. It's a role that we take very seriously. And we certainly hope that as the details of the capital frameworks get unveiled, this is fully taken into consideration, including the impact on U.S. competitiveness, and we need a level playing field with Europe, not a gold-plated one, and we share the concern that higher capital levels will undoubtedly increase the cost of capital for medium- and smaller-sized enterprises and consumers in particular and will drive more activity to non-regulated and lesser capitalized players that isn't in the system's interest.

"Thanks for that perspective, Jane, very well said. Just one quick follow-up for me. PBWM fee income trends, given the lower partner payments, I mean clearly the Wealth fee trends would suggest that they were quite subdued in the quarter. And I just wanted to understand your outlook over the near medium term what drove some of the weakness this quarter? Is it something that you expect will likely persist, especially given some of the market tailwinds that we've been seeing, would have expected to see a little bit more resiliency in Wealth fee income in particular.",quarter,Steven Chubak,Analyst,14,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-14,Citigroup,transcript,"Steven Chubak (Analyst)

"Yes. Look, I think as we mentioned, Wealth was down about 5%. It's really hard to talk the rebound in Wealth in the midst of such an uncertain environment and the one that we're in, it's hard to disconnect those macro factors like rates, inflation, the prospect of a recession from what we're seeing in Wealth. And I think there are two dynamics that have played out. One has been the shift from our customers, from customers more broadly into higher-yielding products from out of deposits. And the other has been the fee revenue from an investment management fee point of view, and as you might think about it, it is a higher rate environment. There are opportunities for clients to earn more. And not until there's greater certainty in the broader macro factors will I think we start to see some real momentum tick up there.",quarter,Mark Mason,CFO,14,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-14,Citigroup,transcript,"Mark Mason (CFO)

"Now with that said, and a couple of things worth reiterating, which is we're seeing very strong referral momentum from the Retail Banking business up through wealth continuum, if you will. So, we've had about 25,000 referrals May year-to-date from our retail branches into our broader Wealth business, that's a good thing. We've seen the number of clients that we've onboarded tick up pretty meaningfully, both in the Private Bank and more broadly across Wealth. That's a good thing.

"Got it. Thank you. Look, our current reserves, as you know, as we think about CECL, we've got 3 different scenarios, we've got a base case in upside, a downside. Our current reserves are based on the mix of those 3 macroeconomic scenarios. It reflects about a 5.1% unemployment rate on a weighted basis over the 8 quarters, and it's roughly flat to what it was last quarter. What that means is, obviously, our downside scenario has unemployment that's much higher than that, closer to 7% or call it 6.8% or so.

"I would point out though that in addition to unemployment and because has been as stubborn as it has been, if you will, we also look at debt service coverage ratio as an important factor as we think about our consumers, as we think about their balance sheet, as we think about the risk that they may or may not be facing. So unemployment is an important factor, but we've flexed our thinking in light of the environment and in light of how behaviors have been shifting, and that's an important factor in how we think about our reserves as well.

You heard us mention earlier, we've got $20 billion of reserves, we're well reserved across the portfolio, but those are all important elements to it.",quarter,Mark Mason,CFO,15,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-14,Citigroup,transcript,"Mark Mason (CFO)

So it's not just ‘ 25, just to be clear. And we do continue to feel very confident around our ability to do that. You heard us mention the levers that we think will contribute to that.

"But again, all of this is tied into how we've calculated our reserves, the delinquencies that we're seeing, the mix of the portfolio, which again skews towards your higher FICO scores and the customer behaviors that we're seeing, which play through not only that cost of credit line, but also plays through the growth that we referenced earlier in the top line.

And we are seeing more pressure on the lower FICOs. We don't have a large number of that in our portfolio, but that is where we're seeing more of the normalization happening on the payment rates, for example, and other behaviors in there.

"And I think as we think about the view on how rates will evolve, you'll see a continued shift there. I think that that when we look to print this quarter, number will probably come down a bit in terms of interest rate exposure and skew even more towards non-U.S. dollar currencies in light of where rates are in those markets and the U.S. dollar will likely be somewhat neutral in light of that curve currently looks like. But again, something we actively manage, first with an eye towards what client demand and needs are likely to be for use of our liquidity but also with a view for how the macro environment might evolve and what we're hearing from central banks around the world.",quarter,Mark Mason,CFO,17,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-14,Citigroup,transcript,"Mark Mason (CFO)

"I meant to follow up earlier on the bending of the cost curve, but if you were to put different initiatives in terms of how far along you are maybe like your exits might be in the eighth inning, and your transformation might be in the sixth inning, and your remediation in the fifth inning, the simplification in the first inning or second inning. Are those numbers correct? How would you put those numbers? And in terms of bending the cost curve, where are you further along and where are you just getting started?",quarter,Mike Mayo,Analyst,17,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-14,Citigroup,transcript,"Mike Mayo (Analyst)

"Well, Mike, you know I love you, but I'm not going to play that game. What I will say is that we clearly have work that we're doing as it relates to the exits, but making very good progress on that, not just on the closing of the exits but also on putting a dent in the stranded costs associated with those exits that we have closed.",quarter,Mark Mason,CFO,17,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-14,Citigroup,transcript,"Mark Mason (CFO)

"And so, as Jane mentioned in her prepared remarks, by the time we get to end of the year, ex-Mexico, we would have made a considerable amount of progress on there, and that creates an opportunity to do more around the simplification of the organization and so that simplification is obviously in an earlier inning, call it, the exits in a later inning.",quarter,Mark Mason,CFO,17,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-14,Citigroup,transcript,"Mark Mason (CFO)

"I think that the transformation spend investments and those things, look we are squarely into execution, as you've heard us mention before. And as I've mentioned, the expense base around that is going to continue to morph from spend that we've made around third-party consultants and that helped in the crafting of the plan towards technology, towards people that are critically involved in the execution of it and then a downward trajectory towards the benefits we get from that technology and reduced operational expense. And so, it's a multi-year journey, we've talked about that. We've got a number of years to continue to execute against it. But what's important is we know what we have to do, both in how we're investing that money and as it relates to being disciplined about our cost structure and bending the curve. And again, that's what we're going to do.",quarter,Mark Mason,CFO,17,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-14,Citigroup,transcript,"Mark Mason (CFO)

"Yes, again we’ve got, I think the number I shared was somewhere around 13,000 people or so that are broadly working on the efforts here. We haven't gotten into specific costs; you know it's in the total number. But what I would say again is that we're clear on what we've got to deliver and execute against and we're managing that cost very tightly. We're constantly looking at opportunities to deliver on those transformation deliverables, more efficiently, leveraging technology, leveraging AI in some instances. And so we're not just taking those execution plans as they were crafted and delivering against them. But we're looking for efficiencies and even the execution plans as they're constructed today.

"A question about your Markets related net interest income. And before I ask the question, I do appreciate that you run those businesses on a holistic basis and that NII is probably more of a residual outcome. But a couple of questions related to Markets-related NII. First is, you had a pretty nice jump up in the second quarter versus the first quarter. And I just wanted to understand, is that largely related to seasonal dividend issues?",quarter,Charles Peabody,Analyst,18,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-14,Citigroup,transcript,"Charles Peabody (Analyst)

"And then secondly, you have a positive NII outcome, where a lot of your money center in brethren will have a negative NII outcome for Markets and I was just wondering what the difference is? Is it the outsized FICC business relative to Equities? Or is it the international? Or is it how you hedge? What's the difference on that?

"Thanks for the question, and thanks for the acknowledgment that we do manage our Markets revenues in total, so I appreciate that. What I would say in terms of the Markets NII is, you've captured it right, which is the dynamic that's playing out between first quarter and second quarter is, in fact, dividend season. And again, given the globality of our franchise, the dividend is not just a dividend in any one region, but dividend in multiple regions playing out over the course of the first and second quarter.",quarter,Mark Mason,CFO,18,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-14,Citigroup,transcript,"Mark Mason (CFO)

"I can't speak to the peers at this particular stage. But what I would say is that you know that our book skews more so than peers to corporates, and that's important.

"Okay. And just as a follow-up, is there any sort of directional guidance you can give on Markets related to NII?

"Couple of questions. Number one, so capital, Jane and Mark, going back to that, should we expect that given what you've mentioned, given everything going on in the regulatory environment, ratio you're at currently, it should grow in anticipation of what may come or likely to come with all the regulatory stuff?

"I think we're going to see exactly what the framework is that comes out and then the implementation time frame for it and then look at making adjustments to plan, also hoping that the comment period is taken seriously and the different considerations I talked about earlier are taken into effect. Then we'll work through what are adjustments we make, pricing capital reallocation, etc., the playbook that you would expect the same one that we've done with SA-CCR and we've done with a number of other pieces. And we would also hope to see our SCB in a different place for the same reasons we talked about earlier Vivek, because there's a lot of volatility in that SCB dependent on the scenario that comes out every year. And I would say, given the shifts we're making in the business model, we'd expect to see that one come down.",quarter,Jane Fraser,CEO,19,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-14,Citigroup,transcript,"Jane Fraser (CEO)

"The only thing I'd add is again, the CET1 ratio of the 13.3% as of October 1, would be a 12.3% reg required level and 100 basis points of the management buffer. So that would be what we’d be held to as of October 1. As Jane mentioned, the NPR as it comes out, we'll take a look at that and see if there are implications on the CET1 stack, but more likely implications on the risk-weighted assets, right? And what's really important there aside from the very important points Jane made in terms of considering broader factors is the timing of the implementation of whatever that final rule includes and obviously, the more timing for implementation, the more of an ability it gets for the industry to think about how to absorb the implications there.",quarter,Mark Mason,CFO,19,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-14,Citigroup,transcript,"Mark Mason (CFO)

"Completely unrelated, if I may. Noninterest-bearing deposits, what are you seeing given you're very heavily corporate driven. When I look at your point-to-point because you don't give a full average balance sheet, it's only interest-bearing related. But the noninterest-bearing is only available on a period end. If I look at that, there was a big drop in the U.S. this quarter. Anything unusual? Is that accelerating? What are you seeing amongst your clients, people still waking up?

"Well, again, I think the point I'd make here is that we continue to see clients shift from kind of noninterest-bearing deposits and into both interest-bearing and CDs and other higher-yielding products in light of the rate environment that we're in. And I would expect us to continue to see those types of shifts subject to how rates continue to evolve. And again, on the corporate side, we've seen in the U.S. clients have reached kind of those terminal, that terminal level, terminal betas, I should say, outside of the U.S. rate hikes, I think, are still in the future, as Jane alluded to, and the terminal betas have not quite yet been reached.

"Yes. Thank you, Mike. That's a few different parts to that, so let's start by just taking a step back. Our transformation is addressing decades of under-investment in large parts of Citi's infrastructure and in our risk and control environment. And when you unpack that, those areas where we had an absence of enforced enterprise-wide standards and governance, we've had a siloed organization that's prevented scale, a culture where a lot of groups were allowed to solve problem – the same problem in different ways, fragmented tech platforms, manual processes and controls, and a weak first line of defense, too few subject matter experts. So, this is a massive body of work that goes well beyond the consent order and this is not old Citi putting in Band-Aids. This is Citi tackling the root issues head on. It's a multiyear undertaking as we've talked about and you saw the statement by one of our regulators this week, we have made meaningful progress on our transformation and on our simplification.",quarter,JANE FRASER,CEO,7,Q and A,Q2_2024,2024-07-12,Citigroup,transcript,"JANE FRASER (CEO)

"Hi. Thank you. So, Mark, I heard your comments on credit this year. I'm talking the US Personal Banking. I heard your comments for credit the rest of this year and I think in a position that you're very conservatively reserved. But right now, you put up a 3% margin and credit costs are almost half of what revenues are in this space. I guess, my question is this: As we roll forward, in a slowing economy with likely a little bit lower – some rate cuts, how does the P&L evolve? How does it improve from here? Because can we be expecting credit costs to come in, in a slowing economy? I'm just trying to figure out the path forward because it could be impactful if USPB obviously marches to where you need it to be.",quarter,GLENN SCHORR,Analyst,8,Q and A,Q2_2024,2024-07-12,Citigroup,transcript,"GLENN SCHORR (Analyst)

"Yeah, look, like I said, we do think that there is certainly upside to USPB. We're looking for that upside in the medium-term targets that we've set for ourselves. You've got to remember that when you look at the quarter and you look at the half, frankly, that we're still in a period where we're seeing the normalization of the cost of credit. And as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, you have kind of a compounding effect of multiple vintages now maturing at the same time that's playing through the P&L. That's not just true for us, that's true for others as well. And so we'd expect and we are – we do believe we're seeing some signs of a cresting when you look at delinquencies now and so we would expect that those losses start to normalize and loss rates start to come down as we go towards the medium term.",quarter,MARK MASON,CFO,8,Q and A,Q2_2024,2024-07-12,Citigroup,transcript,"MARK MASON (CFO)

"Look, I think when we think about the back half of 2024, we're going to see a different mix of activity in Banking. We do still expect demand to be quite strong across our capital market products because you've got a wall of maturing debt securities coming up in the second half that carry on for a couple of years. But, we did see some clients accelerating issuances into the first half getting ahead of potential market volatility. So, if you put it all together, I think we expect the rate environment and the financing markets to continue to be accommodative as well as to continue deal making with M&A being a bit larger in the overall mix, although some of the regulatory elements have put a damper on part of that.",quarter,JANE FRASER,CEO,9,Q and A,Q2_2024,2024-07-12,Citigroup,transcript,"JANE FRASER (CEO)

"Yeah. So, I'd say a couple things. So, one, as I mentioned, in the quarter and you see it on slide 9, ex-Markets, we're down about 3%. That's largely driven by some FX translation that played through, but also some seasonally lower revolving card balances and then lower interest rates in Argentina. And what that is in Argentina, we have capital there, the policy rate was adjusted downward and as that happened, we obviously earned less on that capital that flows through the NII line.",quarter,MARK MASON,CFO,9,Q and A,Q2_2024,2024-07-12,Citigroup,transcript,"MARK MASON (CFO)

"In terms of the headwinds, you've got the lower NII earned in Argentina from rates, that'll continue to play through. We've got assumed higher average betas in 2024, specifically on the non-US side. We still have in our forecast the impact of CFPB late fees, so assuming that that goes into effect for this year, that will have an impact and it's in the forecast, and then the impact of lost NII from the exits that we have. And so, the combination of those things will probably mean that NII in the back half of the year is a little bit higher than the first half, but again, consistent with the guidance that we gave of modestly down.",quarter,MARK MASON,CFO,10,Q and A,Q2_2024,2024-07-12,Citigroup,transcript,"MARK MASON (CFO)

"That's helpful. And maybe just quickly, kind of a similar question on expenses. Better-than-expected this quarter, but there was no restructuring or repositioning charges. I think to get to the high end of your range, you'd have to be up a little bit in the back half from 2Q run rate.

"Yeah, so that's right. When I talk about it at the first quarter, I talked about kind of a downward trend for each of the quarters after Q1. The second quarter came in a bit lower than we were expecting. I'm sticking with the guidance and it does mean that the back half of the year will likely come in – will come in higher than the second quarter. That's a combination of a couple of things, including the pace of hiring and investment that we will do in the transformation work that has to be done. It also includes repositioning charges that we might take or need to take as we continue to work through our businesses across the firm and the franchise and then the second quarter did or – yeah, the second quarter did have a one-time or so and some delayed spending that will pick up in the third and fourth quarter around advertising and marketing and some of the other line items.

It looks like you didn't buy back any in the second quarter. And I'm asking this question in this context because consensus has a buyback of nearly $1 billion in the fourth quarter and staying at this rate for the first half of next year and ramping higher. And I guess, is the $1 billion number a catch-up pace because you didn't buy back any in the second quarter? And I fully appreciate that you also have the Banamex IPO coming, which is different from peers that are also waiting for Basel clarification.

"Okay. So, we are not going to be giving guidance going forward around our buybacks. We are going to continue to give quarterly and make it a quarterly determination as to the level.

"Hey, thanks, good morning. Hey, Mark. Talking about the NII outlook and the fact that now we've got a little bit of a discrepancy starting between US rates, maybe higher for longer, and then the beginnings of some of the non-US curve starting to, at least put fourth their first cut. I know we've got that good chart that you have in the Qs about the relative contributions. Can you just help us understand a little bit of like just generally how you're thinking through that discrepancy and how that informs the difference between US-related NII and non-US-related NII as you go forward?",quarter,KEN USDIN,Analyst,11,Q and A,Q2_2024,2024-07-12,Citigroup,transcript,"KEN USDIN (Analyst)

"Yeah, thank you. So look, I think that as we look at it, out through the – certainly through the medium term, we expect to see continued NII growth at obviously a modest level, certainly lower than what we've seen historically and that's in large part because or in part I should say because of how we've been managing the balance sheet and that has allowed for us to reinvest as securities have rolled off and earn a higher yield on them relative to what we were earning, in some instances, they were five-year terms on some of these investments. And so we still think there's some upside from a reinvestment point of view.",quarter,MARK MASON,CFO,11,Q and A,Q2_2024,2024-07-12,Citigroup,transcript,"MARK MASON (CFO)

"The point you make around kind of non-US dollar or US rates kind of coming off, that'll play through a little bit as we think about the beta increases that we're expecting outside of the US. And so, we've assumed that we have higher betas pick up outside of the US. If rates kind of come off in a more substantive way, then we could see kind of a little less NII pressure than we're forecasting there. But net-net, as I think about the combination of volume growth that we're expecting between loans and deposits over that medium term, the higher yield we can earn on our assets, combined with the pricing capabilities that we have across the portfolio, offsetting some of that beta, we believe we'll have continued NII growth.",quarter,MARK MASON,CFO,11,Q and A,Q2_2024,2024-07-12,Citigroup,transcript,"MARK MASON (CFO)

"As I think about what I often point to in terms of the IRE analysis and you have to remember that that is a shock to the current balance sheet and it assumes that the full curve is moving simultaneously, cross currencies. And in that case, the 100 basis point parallel shift downward would be a negative $1.6 billion, with about $1.3 billion coming from non-US dollar. But again, that does assume that all of those currencies come down at the same time and doesn't account for the rebalancing of the balance sheet and things that I mentioned like the reinvestment higher yields that we'd be able to earn.",quarter,MARK MASON,CFO,12,Q and A,Q2_2024,2024-07-12,Citigroup,transcript,"MARK MASON (CFO)

"Hi good afternoon. So, I know we talked a lot about expenses. I just have one kind of overarching question here, which is on how we should think about the path of expenses between now and the medium term, as we have come quite a long way in the simplification process. Maybe if you could give us a sense as to how far along simplification impact on expenses we are? And overlapping with the regulatory requirements, do these net out or are we skewed a little bit more towards regulatory requirements being a bit heavier than what's left on simplification from here?

"So, thank you, Betsy. I guess I'd say a couple things. So, I think we said it in the past. So, the target for the medium term, we think 2026 is somewhere around $51 billion to $53 billion of expenses. As we've said, we'll have about $1.5 billion in savings related to the restructuring that we've done and another $500 million to $1 billion related to net expense reductions from eliminating the stranded costs as well as additional productivity over that medium-term period. And so, we've made, I think, very good headway, as Jane has mentioned, in the org simplification and the restructuring charges associated with that. Those saves will have started to generate. Some of those saves in the early part of that, meaning this year, will likely be offset by continued investment that we're making in areas of the business like transformation, but also in business-led or driven growth. And you should expect in terms of the trend that we would have a downward trend towards 2026 in achieving that range.",quarter,MARK MASON,CFO,12,Q and A,Q2_2024,2024-07-12,Citigroup,transcript,"MARK MASON (CFO)

"Yeah, I think that's a great point, Jane. Look, the reality is, as was pointed out earlier, we spent about $3 billion last year, a little bit under that, on the transformation-related work. And the plan has called for us to spend a little bit more than that this year. And frankly, in the first half of the year, as we work through the transformation work and some of the things that Jane and I have mentioned earlier in the year that we've been focused on, like data and data related to regulatory reporting, we've had to spend more than we had planned for in the first half, right, and we've done that and we funded that.",quarter,MARK MASON,CFO,13,Q and A,Q2_2024,2024-07-12,Citigroup,transcript,"MARK MASON (CFO)

"We've been able to find productivity opportunities that allow for us to still stay within the guidance that we've given for the full year. So, we are managing this entire expense base, right, so not – the whole $53 billion plus of it, we are actively managing that with an eye towards what's required from a transformation point of view to keep it on track, to accelerate in areas where we're behind and to shore up areas where we're tracking in accordance to what the order requires and where are the other inefficiencies that can allow for us to free up the expense base? And so, things like the work that Andy Sieg has done with the finance team around that expense base and finding efficiencies there are opportunities that we've been able to tease out of the business. Things that we have done in parts of USPB and that we have continued to get after in parts of Banking, which you see in the down 10% this quarter are areas where we've been keenly focused on, where are there duplicative roles, where are there inefficient processes that we can actually drive greater efficiency out of. So, longwinded way of saying, we understand the expense guidance that we've given, we also understand and stress the importance of funding the transformation with what's required and we're doing both.",quarter,MARK MASON,CFO,13,Q and A,Q2_2024,2024-07-12,Citigroup,transcript,"MARK MASON (CFO)

And so, what we're saying is that if we identify issues in the quarters to come, that we haven't identified already, that's the process we're going to apply to those issues.

And it's a shift probably from some other ways in the past, but I'm very pleased with how disciplined the team is being around this and we're seeing the benefits of it.",quarter,JANE FRASER,CEO,16,Q and A,Q2_2024,2024-07-12,Citigroup,transcript,"JANE FRASER (CEO)

"Yeah. And that may be different from what you hear and see from other players in the space. But as Jane mentioned, we're keenly focused on ensuring that, yes, we have a good partnership, but that we're generating an appropriate return. That's part of achieving our medium-term targets. And as you know, since you brought up Retail cards, I mean, when we think about how CECL works and the reserves you have to establish for these partnerships, we're establishing full, lifetime reserves that's on the balance sheet where ultimately we end up splitting those through the partner sharing economics. So, it's another important consideration as we think about expanding and taking on these relationships and renegotiating partnerships to making sure that returns make good sense for us.",quarter,MARK MASON,CFO,16,Q and A,Q2_2024,2024-07-12,Citigroup,transcript,"MARK MASON (CFO)

"Look, in terms of the consent order and the areas we've had delays, there are four areas to the consent order. It's risk management, it's data governance, it's around compliance and it's around control. As we've said, we were falling behind in certain areas related to data and we've been investing to address the areas that we were behind. We also saw an increase in the scope related to regulatory reporting, so we added some more bodies of work there and we're well underway.

"Hi. Just two clarifications. So, this is a very high-profile amendment to the consent order. And I think what I hear you saying that if you can confirm, your risk compliance and controls are getting passing grade. It's really the data and as it relates to the data, you're talking about 11,000 regulatory reports, some which had 750,000 lines of data. Is that really the scope of what you need to fix? Because people see this externally and say, hey, you're failing in terms of overall controls and resiliency. But I think I hear you saying it's really more about just the data and the regulatory reporting, which is important, but more of a slice of a broader picture.

"Yeah, Mike, maybe I just – maybe I – you're asking a great and it's an important question, so maybe I try and explain what the data elements because it's an area that Mark and I have pointed to. So, first of all, we use data all over the firm. We use it to deliver 72 million customer statements every month. Our corporate clients, as you heard about at our Services Investor Day, access account data real-time across multiple countries on CitiDirect. And we're moving $5 trillion roughly per day for those clients around the world. We trade billions of dollars in a millisecond on our trading platforms. We can see our liquidity positions real-time around the world.

"We're making sure we're capturing data accurately using smart tools and automation. We'll often talk about this smart system, makes sure there's no errors when we book a trade. We've seen our error rate down 85% as a result of it. We're housing our upstream data in two standardized repositories, they're the golden sources, an in-person data hub which you've heard me talk about a few times and they're a golden source now for all of the downstream data use, populating the thousands of regulatory reports Mark talked about and other areas. And what a single repository means is that the data models, the data quality rules, the controls you put in place that govern and manage that data, they all sit in one place rather than being distributed all over the firm as they have been historically.",quarter,JANE FRASER,CEO,17,Q and A,Q2_2024,2024-07-12,Citigroup,transcript,"JANE FRASER (CEO)

"Mark's been investing in building a standardized reporting infrastructure. You've heard us talk about a single full suite reporting ledger versus the six or so reporting ledgers that we had in the past. And we're delivering all of this through consolidated systems, through the automation and streamlining of data flows, so instead of being in multiple pipes, the flows go through single pipes. So, it's a, sorry to get a bit plumber on you for a moment, but I think it is important to understand what it is because it's a lot of work. It's a strategic overhaul.

"Hi. Jane, you spoke more about the restructuring that you commented on recently. The real question is, why is this restructuring different than the other 5 or 10 or 15 restructurings we've heard about since Citi's creation in its current form 25 years ago, I think, just like a week ago? So, I'd say, why is this different? We hear the talk about cascading downward and the simplification, reducing dual heads and the committees. But we've heard this so much that why is this time different?",quarter,Mike Mayo,Analyst,8,Q and A,Q3_2023,2023-10-13,Citigroup,transcript,"Mike Mayo (Analyst)

"Yeah. It's a very important question, Mike, thank you for asking it. As I've said, we view these as the most consequential changes we've made, not just to our organization model, but how we run the bank, in almost two decades. And the first piece is simple, which is our org model was set up for a financial supermarket, that is simply not the bank we are today. So we are aligning the organizational model with that simper business mix and strategy.",quarter,Jane Fraser,CEO,8,Q and A,Q3_2023,2023-10-13,Citigroup,transcript,"Jane Fraser (CEO)
Citigroup, Q3, 2023 Earnings Call Transcript, Page 8"
"But what's truly different is we're changing how we run the bank. And these are permanent changes that will be driven all the way down through the organization. So let me give you some examples to bring it to life. We talked about delayering the first two or three layers of the bank. That will continue through the organization, through the spans and layers, particularly getting rid of aggregator roles. And let me give an example: HR, we had HR in a region, you had the region head, you had the Institutional Client Group head, you had the Banking head, in addition, you had a North Asia head and a South Asia head. We're just going to have the North Asia head and the South Asia head. And all of those roles collapsed into those two.",quarter,Jane Fraser,CEO,8,Q and A,Q3_2023,2023-10-13,Citigroup,transcript,"Jane Fraser (CEO)

"We're eliminating activities in the geographies that we just don't need anymore, because we are no longer running local consumer franchises in them. So, let's take the financial reporting, sorry, the management reporting that Mark and I referred to in the opening remarks. We can reduce our management reports by about 50%. That's 1,000 reports. What does that mean? Shadow P&Ls by country, quarterly outlooks, monthly performance updates, all the associated tracking and reconciliations that are there that are effectively for a shadow P&L, rather than the one that matters to our shareholders. And so, that greatly declutters.",quarter,Jane Fraser,CEO,8,Q and A,Q3_2023,2023-10-13,Citigroup,transcript,"Jane Fraser (CEO)

"So, I'm curious, you mentioned that you're still marching towards the 11%, 12%, which is good because everyone was going to ask that. My question is a little bit different of, with the denominator going up 25%, in other words, a lot of things are working towards your Transformation, but there's sort of a curve ball in there with upping the denominator by 25%. So, you seem to be a beneficiary of higher for longer for sure. And you also mentioned you're working on mitigation as we speak. So, maybe you could talk about what are the offsets that we don't see that give you confidence still working towards that, because the top line stuff is working?",quarter,Glenn Schorr,Analyst,9,Q and A,Q3_2023,2023-10-13,Citigroup,transcript,"Glenn Schorr (Analyst)
Citigroup, Q3, 2023 Earnings Call Transcript, Page 9"
"So, good morning, Glenn, it's good to hear from you. Let me make a couple comments on that, and then, Jane, feel free to chime in if you'd like. The first thing is that when I talked about this at the last conference we attended, I mentioned that analysts were somewhere in the 16% to 19% range in terms of a capital increase, and we're likely to be inside of that range, assuming the Basel III proposal as it’ s structured, as it's written, and obviously that's not the final, there's a period of review that's going on now.",quarter,Mark Mason,CFO,9,Q and A,Q3_2023,2023-10-13,Citigroup,transcript,"Mark Mason (CFO)
Citigroup, Q3, 2023 Earnings Call Transcript, Page 9"
"What I'd say is a couple things, Glenn. One, we haven't fully executed against the strategy that Jane has just described. And obviously, continuing to simplify the business, managing through the Transformation, changing that business mix that we have to something that's more consistent and predictable and repeatable as it relates to PPNR, those things matter and impact the SCB. We talked about the exiting of the international consumer businesses. That will be a factor in what our balance sheet looks like and what stress losses might look like as well as lowering the expense base, which we know is an important factor in that PPNR math as well. And so, those things help, I think, to reduce the amount of capital that might be required as we get into that medium-term period.",quarter,Mark Mason,CFO,9,Q and A,Q3_2023,2023-10-13,Citigroup,transcript,"Mark Mason (CFO)
Citigroup, Q3, 2023 Earnings Call Transcript, Page 9"
"Importantly, as you point out, there are other elements of the proposal that are going to require that we take a hard look at as well and identify mitigating actions to the extent that they make it into the final. So, think about the increase in operational risk and the fact that some of that is already included in SCB as something of a point of advocacy. But that's obviously a big headwind that we'll have to kind of work through, the FRTB and the enhancement of models. Now, there's a global market shock as well, but again another point of advocacy that we need to work through.",quarter,Mark Mason,CFO,10,Q and A,Q3_2023,2023-10-13,Citigroup,transcript,"Mark Mason (CFO)
Citigroup, Q3, 2023 Earnings Call Transcript, Page 10"
"The equity investments, and now that they go from 100% risk weighting to 400% risk weighting, I think we're going to take a hard look at whether those are worth keeping in light of the higher capital associated with them. That's going to challenge the returns, that's going to force us to look at those through a different strategic lens, and we're going to do that. And that's not to even mention the credit component that impacts both corporates and consumers as it relates to unfunded commitments, for example.",quarter,Mark Mason,CFO,10,Q and A,Q3_2023,2023-10-13,Citigroup,transcript,"Mark Mason (CFO)

"And so, as we've done with SA-CCR and other types of reg changes, we're going to have to look at what it means for our product mix, the returns associated with those, whether there are opportunities to pull levers like pricing, or whether we have to take other decisions around those. And so, that's what I mean by the mitigating actions that we're dimensioning and putting on paper and working through, but again, want to be thoughtful because the rule is not final yet, and there are more discussions to be had around those important elements that I mentioned already.",quarter,Mark Mason,CFO,10,Q and A,Q3_2023,2023-10-13,Citigroup,transcript,"Mark Mason (CFO)

"Good morning. You've talked a lot about defense, as I like to call it, in terms of the Transformation that Jane had outlined and bending the expense curve. But I'm wondering, for both Jane and Mark, if you could sort of address what I think is probably the most debated part of your target, which is that revenue CAGR of 5%. You put up a very nice quarter in terms of revenues, both net interest income and fees. And maybe help us sort of look underneath the surface in terms of that momentum and maybe break it down in terms of what's really going well. I think TTS continues to surprise to the upside, are we going to be, two years from now, we’ re going to be like, oh, well, TTS is continuing to be doing well. So, what are the businesses that really sort of strong secular momentum that you feel is being under-recognized versus how you could position cyclically and higher for longer?

"So, there’ s a couple of unstoppable trends that we’ re going to be riding in the next, I think it’ s decade-long. The corporate client of today, and indeed consumer, has to build resiliency. The multinational client is on a long-term trend of building resiliency, be it because of green, be it because of geopolitics, be it because of regulatory, whatever the different reasons may be, and there are multiple, they're having to build resiliency into supply chains, into their own operations as they operate around the world. We’re the bank that is absolutely there for them. And I think you've seen that in TTS, where we've had such strong drivers of growth in the last few years at the beginning of this trend. So, that is an important one. Wherever the clients want to go, we are there. We have been there for decades. We understand the risk. We understand the client base. We understand the opportunities there, at that. That micro level and local levels that someone who is flying in with a suitcase can't possibly deliver. And it's connected globally.

"Linked into it is what I think of as a hidden gem amongst our crown jewels is Securities Services. It equally in custody has this extraordinary global network, the connectivity everywhere. We have been investing behind this business. We've been growing our market share in North America in asset managers, where we've been underweight, with a number of material marquee wins. You can see the share gain that we're getting in this business, the pipeline of deals that we've already won as well as the new pipelines going forward. Very high return. We're investing both in terms of our cloud, our data, our client experience. And this is in a way, let's say, I do view this as a hidden gem with extremely attractive return profile, fee profile, and other dimensions to it. We've quite a long way to run here. So, similar story to TTS, slightly different client base, competitively advantaged because you've got both the pre-trade and the post-trade. We connect the two. Huge efficiencies for clients.

It's almost by definition the fastest growing of the mid-market companies are the ones that tap into what we can offer them. We build great relationships with them.

And so, I think what's important to remember, as it relates to our business, is that it's global. That we've got, while you're right in that, on the U.S. dollar side, we've seen betas kind of reach, particularly for our corporate clients, reach terminal levels at the end of last year.

"Well, I think a couple pieces. I actually start with Q3 is the seventh quarter of the current IB downturn. So, since 2000, downturns have tended not to last longer than seven quarters because that's often how long it takes for pricing expectations to fully adjust to new realities. And we're starting to see that particularly in the debt capital markets, investment grade markets, where the expectation of no longer how high, but how long for rates, we've seen clients who get off the sidelines and just bite the bullet and get into the debt capital markets in a more meaningful way and no longer waiting on that.",quarter,Jane Fraser,CEO,12,Q and A,Q3_2023,2023-10-13,Citigroup,transcript,"Jane Fraser (CEO)

"Hi good morning. So, Mark and Jane, I do recognize you'll provide a more fulsome update on expense actions next quarter, but one of the things I was hoping was that you could frame the expense opportunity in the context of your headcount trends. And prior to COVID, as well as the consent order, mind you, Citi was running with 200,000 direct staff. That number is closer to 240,000 today. It's an increase of 20%, even with multiple divestitures that you've consummated.

"One additional point is that you've heard me mention before that we've taken probably about $600 million or so year-to-date in repositioning charges. And with that will come roughly 7,000 or so headcount coming down associated with those repositioning charges. And so, and we'll continue to do that, by the way, we haven't even begun to take repositioning charges associated with the org simplification that's underway. That will come in the fourth quarter and then the first quarter of next year.

Just maybe, Mark, following up on that, as we think about bending the curve through the end of next year, maybe if you can talk to around as we think about the puts and takes between investments and expense saves, how much of that cost save or bending the curve is going to happen in Legacy versus PBWM and ICG?

"Hi. There were some quotes, I think, in the media, Jane, from you talking about some signs of pressure among the lower end of the consumer, and I appreciate the pie chart that you have in the deck showing it's not a huge percent of the card portfolio. But could you elaborate on that? And then also just address the, you mentioned directionally how the payment rates in cards are coming down, but if we look at the growth in spend versus the growth in loans, it is kind of a little disproportionate. I think spend is up a couple percent year-over-year, and the loans are 11%. So, as we think about being kind of later-cycle, is that something that you're paying attention to as a potential sign of further weakness in credit?",quarter,Matt O'Connor,Analyst,13,Q and A,Q3_2023,2023-10-13,Citigroup,transcript,"Matt O'Connor (Analyst)

So, the other thing that's driving this is the new account acquisitions are obviously important drivers of that spend volume and ultimately that loan growth.

"So, let me take the second one first. I'm not planning on replacing it with anything. We don't need them. We're no longer running consumer franchises in the countries. Instead, we've got global businesses that are operating very consistently in the individual geographies, so we just don't need to replace them. And it enables us just to have the legal entity, financial management that we need. And then our internal reports get greatly simplified. Same as they get greatly simplified by taking out ICG and PBWM is another, eliminating that layer also eliminates a lot of different reports.

"The first question was about, okay, help you understand what we've done. So, on the geography front, we have done two main things already. One is we've eliminated the regions and have just put a single international head reporting to me. So, that makes it much simpler for me. I have one international head, and then he will help us manage the geographies collectively.",quarter,Jane Fraser,CEO,15,Q and A,Q3_2023,2023-10-13,Citigroup,transcript,"Jane Fraser (CEO)

"The second piece is we really narrowed the mandate of geography to delivering to our clients and covering our clients in their countries. And secondly, the legal entity management. And otherwise, before, we had a huge amount of management on shadow P&Ls and different, a lot of very heavy committee structure. That was necessary because the business was still very local, as a retail bank, a local credit card business, a local onshore wealth business. They've gone. It's just serving multinationals. The subsidiaries are multinationals and in some markets the investors and the wealth clients in some markets. And that's a much simpler business to manage. So, we could get rid of the regional layer, and we just jump straight down to the clusters that we have today.

"And the bit that I'm excited about is not just, yes, this makes it much simpler to manage, but it also helps us really focus on the global network. Now, our geographies and our banking organizations sitting together on the same management structure are collectively accountable for serving and delivering against our core client base. And they're in one team to do it. It just makes it much easier. Does that give you a feel?

"The other thing, Vivek, that I think is important here is we really want to spend a little bit more investment in time on the client lens in terms of the financial reporting, right? Because, as Jane talked about, we talked about the synergies across the franchise that we can capture, the ability to leverage the offering we have for those different client segments. So, looking at that P&L, looking at those returns, looking at that growth opportunity through that client lens will be something where we want to enhance the metrics that we have already around that so that we can capture that upside.",quarter,Mark Mason,CFO,16,Q and A,Q3_2023,2023-10-13,Citigroup,transcript,"Mark Mason (CFO)

"And around the other piece that I think is also just an important point, globalization is changing and we're seeing these lanes all changing through trade, financial flows, et cetera. By actually having a single international organization and then the different clusters, North and South Asia, Europe, UK, LATAM, Middle East, Africa, the connection points between them are really changing at the moment. And so, this makes us much more agile in our delivery of the global network because I think it's much more in line with how the world is operating today.",quarter,Jane Fraser,CEO,16,Q and A,Q3_2023,2023-10-13,Citigroup,transcript,"Jane Fraser (CEO)

"Hi there. So, I wanted to continue on the thread of normalization of credit losses. And you guys have, I guess your guidance is implying that Branded Cards and Retail Services get back to more normalized levels by year-end, which is a decent-sized uptick over the levels you had in the third quarter. So, I kind of want to know what's driving that view. But more importantly I guess, what does that imply going forward? And does it imply that we get to more, something more like above trend losses?

"Yes. So, let me start on that, and then, Jane, if you want to chime in, that's fine. I think what I'd point you to is page 24 in the deck that we have because it gives you a nice snapshot of how both the loss rates have been trending but also how the delinquencies have been trending.

In the ex-Markets NII, $11.96 billion this quarter, based on what you've said, the back book repricing, deposit flex, is it safe to conclude that the ex-Markets NII bottomed in 2Q 2024?

I think the other point here is let's not forget that our interest rate sensitivity skews more towards non-US and so a lot of what we think about and talk about tends to be how US rates move and the betas around that.,quarter,Mark Mason,CFO,7,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-15,Citigroup,transcript,"Mark Mason (CFO)

"Hi. I think we've slid over to the afternoon. Good afternoon, guys. The first one is for you, Jane. As I speak with longer term investors, they often offer the commentary that clearly the path from the 7% RoTCE this quarter to the 11% to 12% hopefully will be bridged and to be able to initiate a position before that progress is made, they really sort of want to see more capital optimization. And this question is not really the same question I ask you about buybacks every quarter but really maybe a progress update on Banamex. So there is chatter in the market about Banamex needed to have four quarters of separate financials before being IPOed and I'm wondering if you could give us specific progress on how that's going?

"So let me break it down to a couple of pieces.

"Hi. I looked in detail at the earnings presentation, especially slide 4, and I think the question is, on many people's minds, I count 12 restructurings at Citigroup. And I count 12 restructurings that have failed at Citigroup. You might disagree with the number 12, It could be 5, it could be 8, it could be 12, it could be more, but I've not spoken to one person of any investor who would say that Citi has succeeded on its prior restructuring. So, the question is, why is this time different? Number one, who is this new and improved Citigroup. Number two, why aren't expenses down even move, especially when few people that I talk to think you'll hit your revenue target?

The first is improving the performance and the returns of those five core businesses, so that we can meet the medium-term RoTCE target we laid out. And the second is on addressing our regulatory issues through the transformation. And I would also be, I need to note that I fully recognize that 2024 is an inflection year, Mike.

And you've got proof points of the last three years where we've made a lot of tough decisions and we have put through a tremendous amount of change to get to the simple Citi that we are today.

And this already feels like a different bank. We have more work to do. I recognize 2024 is a critical year, and as I said, the decks are much clearer now, so that we can focus on two imperatives: improving our business performance and executing the transformation. Neither is an entirely linear path as we've seen over the last three years. We all know that. We get we have to build our credibility. We're committed to doing so.

"Yeah, thanks, Jane. And why aren't expenses down more? I think to your point, Jane, we've been investing in the franchise both on the front-end, and importantly, on the transformation and the risk and controls. What I would point out is that, in 2023, we delivered expenses of $54.3 billion ex the FDIC charge. That is the guidance that we gave. But I also highlight that we also included $780 million associated with the restructuring charge. That is more than I had articulated in the way of guidance. So, the capacity that we created through our efforts through the year, we use that in a smart way. We use that to fund the org simplification cost, so that we can realize the savings down the line. And we're going to continue to manage our expenses in a disciplined and smart fashion. That means spending what we need to spend on the transformation and risk and controls, but driving greater efficiencies and productivities along the way to ensure we get to that 11% to 12%.

Your expense guidance is good, your revenue guide is good, and you have your arms around the expenses. The question I have is, how do you think about balancing that near-term profitability improvement that we all want desperately with making sure you do make the right investments? Because if you look around the world there's a lot of places to grow, whether it be a branch network, or the wealth management aspirations that you have, or the digital investments.

"Yeah, thanks, Glenn. I guess, I'll start, and Jane, feel free to add in on it. Look, it is a balancing act, right, and we do look at each of our five core businesses. We obviously are clear on the strategy, but where's the growth? Where are the return opportunities associated with them? And how do we ensure we're deploying resources after them in order to deliver for the client and deliver on those returns over time? We have to juxtapose that against the required investment to modernize our operations and we're making those trade-offs on a regular basis. But importantly, when we do invest to capture those growth opportunities, we're trying to be agile about it, which means if those opportunities don't play out in the way we're expecting because the cycle just doesn't mature or materialize in that fashion, we've got to be disciplined enough to dial them back, and that's what you've seen over the past year plus, is that we've been investing in the business.",both,Mark Mason,CFO,10,Q and A,Q4_2023,2024-01-12,Citigroup,transcript,"Mark Mason (CFO)

"Where we didn't see the upside that we anticipated, we dialed back that spend, right, and that's the type of iterative process, if you will, Glenn, that we're putting in place to ensure that on the other side of this, we're still positioned to capture growth. Investment Banking, for example, we have invested in healthcare, in technology, building out to prepare ourselves for when that market rebounds. We feel good about that. We've done similar things in the way of our Wealth business. We're investing heavily in our TTS franchise to ensure we can remain competitive there, so it's that type of discipline that's required. It is sometimes a trade-off, but it's one that we've been very focused on being smart about.",both,Mark Mason,CFO,11,Q and A,Q4_2023,2024-01-12,Citigroup,transcript,"Mark Mason (CFO)

"Yeah and I'll jump in, too. Let's maybe start with TTS. When we think about the performance of TTS, which, as we say, the growth this year up 19% ex-Argentina, came from a combination of both rates and the strong business actions we've taken. And you can see that in the different drivers. Cross-border was up 23%, commercial cards up 8%. In terms of the growth prospects, we've generated 22% in average revenue growth, from 21 to 23, well ahead of the Investor Day guidance we had of high-single digits. That was not just because of the rate cycle. It obviously helped. And we certainly expect to grow revenues at mid-single digit now as we lap the prior periods that benefited from those rate increases, and that's going to come from a few different areas.",both,Jane Fraser,CEO,11,Q and A,Q4_2023,2024-01-12,Citigroup,transcript,"Jane Fraser (CEO)

So I think, the main takeaway from TTS is that we'll continue to invest in it. We expect to see strong client momentum. We've been getting consistently good client feedback regarding our capabilities, so we expect to see good global growth that will certainly help as the rate cycle comes down.

And then, if you think about the noninterest revenue, for Services, they're up about 20% in the quarter year-over-year if you exclude the impact of the Argentina devaluation, and up 7% on a full year basis.

You're doing about –  severance is $700 million to $1 billion in 2024. So doesn't seem like there's a ton of actual cost saves in that number.

Just if you can talk about that. Thank you.",both,Ebrahim Poonawala,Analyst,14,Q and A,Q4_2023,2024-01-12,Citigroup,transcript,"Ebrahim Poonawala (Analyst)

"The short answer is no. If you think about our Markets business, we have four businesses, each of which are around sort of $4 billion or so in size. You have our global FX network, where we're typically number one in any year, just given the strength, and particularly, the corporate client base we've set off. Rates, typically top three.

"In terms of the spread products, we've been putting our financing and securitization business as part of our simplification, fully within Markets, so that we've created a unified, scaled spreads product business. And then finally, equities, where we're focused on improving our prime offering, building balances. We still have a way to go obviously in that. Prime balances we're pleased they were nicely up this year, driven by client momentum. And we're a leading equities derivative franchise.

"And I'd go back to our big point of differentiation and why we feel we're well-positioned. We have a very differentiated corporate client base and very strong partnerships between our core Markets franchise, TTS, and Banking and Securities Services, and that helps us in FX, in commodities and in rates around the world. So, Markets is important both in terms of its leadership, but also, how it fits into the strengths that we have from this simpler Citi of those five core interconnected businesses.",both,Jane Fraser,CEO,14,Q and A,Q4_2023,2024-01-12,Citigroup,transcript,"Jane Fraser (CEO)

The exits we've got of nonstrategic businesses shows our focus on efficiency. And we've also been doing some good investments in our technology, and that's getting us into a good place there.

"Good afternoon, Mark, Jane. Mark, can you share with us, in your revenue guide, in the net interest income, I know you mentioned it's going to be lower and part of it is due to lower interest rates. Some of your peers have come out with their guides using the forward curve in their net interest income forecast which includes the Fed in our country, six cuts.

"Yeah, I think what I'd point you to is in the range of the $80 billion to $81 billion, we're assuming three to six cuts, right. You've got a range there and the reason I described it like that is that, if you think about our IRE, as we've shown it in the Qs before, we're positioned such that, with 100 basis point move, parallel shift in rate across the curve, the US dollar impact would only be a couple hundred million dollars, all right, and so, to the negative, obviously, but it's a couple hundred million dollars. And so as we think about that forecast, and as I mentioned, NII being down a bit, that covers kind of three to six cuts over the course of 2024, likely back-loaded, but that's what's in there.",both,Mark Mason,CFO,15,Q and A,Q4_2023,2024-01-12,Citigroup,transcript,"Mark Mason (CFO)

I know you still have a little bit of ways to go, but you do have 100 basis point buffer to your minimum. And I know Basel III endgame is still out there, and I'm sure that reducing risk just doesn't mean expenses, but also reducing your – or being mindful of your RWA footprint.

And essentially, what's left is that we have a custody business and we're holding corporate dividends that are our clients' proceeds we’ re unable to pay those out by law, by regulation, and so we have to hold those and so that's what's being referenced in the slide when we say unremittable Russia corporate dividends.

"Yeah. Again, I mean, when I think about our interest rate exposure, and for US dollar in particular, we showed it in our last Q, we'll show it in this Q. For a 100 basis point move in a parallel shift, we're looking at probably a negative $1.6 billion or so, but important to point out that the US dollar component of that is only a couple hundred million dollars. Similarly, if rates moved in the other way, positive of 100 basis points, there'd be a small movement as it relates to US dollar exposure. So our US dollar exposure is relatively neutral, again, assuming a static balance sheet, a parallel shift in the curve.

"So let me just be clear about where the ones that we've just done and that we're working on through the organization simplification. So when I think about that effort, it will close at the end of the first quarter, as we said. We're expecting to get about $1 billion of run rate save from the org simplification work alone. That constitutes about 5,000 heads. We're just about to, at the end of this month, finish Phase 3, which will mean the first four layers of the organization have been addressed.

Andy Sieg is going to be kicking off that in Wealth, and you'll begin to see some of the impact of that in the first quarter. He's off to a strong start. And then, we've got others where we'll be creating more utilities. We've still got different fragmented activities across the firm that the organization simplification has highlighted. We'll be aggregating those, creating utilities, or are consolidating some of those different functions.

We haven't given guidance externally on what that impact is, but we do believe there are offsets and mitigants that, over time, we'll be able to kind of bring into play.

I am struggling to reconcile the 50/50 NII contribution from rate and volume components, just given average loan to deposits were essentially flat year-on-year, NII grew $3 billion. It does imply a much larger contribution from rates. I know there's deposit funds transfer pricing and other noise.

But for the full year, it sounds like you're expecting the charge-offs to be in the range of last year's guidance. Can you just kind of clarify that?

"Sure. So in terms of the net credit losses and the forecast that we have, we are expecting that the net credit losses will be at the high end of the range that we've given. So in the case of Branded Cards, that 3.5% to 4% is the full year range that we've given. In the case of Retail Services, it's 5.75% to 6.25%, excuse me, and so right now, Retail Services is at that high end at 6.28% for 2024. We'd expect it to stay at that high end, and then on Branded Cards, we're at 3.64%, we'd expect it to creep up to about the 4% level over the course of the year. But remember, that is a full year NCL rate, and we know that there's seasonality through the quarters.

"And then just in terms of the provision build, there are a couple of drivers there. One is obviously volume, and we do expect to see volume growth in USPB. So that will be an important factor in how the CECL calculations are done. And then the second driver is obviously, as you know, we run models and the models they have a base scenario, they have a downside, an upside scenario depending on the broader macro factors, unemployment, GDP, et cetera, et cetera, and our weighting towards the likelihood of high or upside or downside scenario, those factors become important considerations in the provisioning.

"Thank you. Hate to ask the umpteenth question on the buyback, but clearly, the way the stock is reacting today, the buyback is very important to your shareholders. I guess my first question, if I could have the two questions, is it's very clear that you want to return capital to shareholders. It's very clear that you have excess capital. It's very clear that your PPNR trajectory is positive. And so what are the specific mile markers that that Citi needs to see in order to increase that pacing from that $1.5 billion a quarter to something is more suggestive of a pace that that would be in line with that $20 billion authorization? And I know that's been asked of you already, but is it the consent order? Is it the stress test? We had some news over the holidays that were positive for the sector. Like what are those specific mile markers? I mean you're doing it on the PPNR side, right?

So you targeted less than $53 billion. Is it fair to assume like Jim was asking that $51 billion to $53 billion is not the target, but it's less than $53 billion? But to that end, I mean just taking a step back, I think, Jane, you said something very important in that want to get to the returns in a sustainable way. And clearly, your shareholders are scarred by previous management when the returns went up to double digits and went back tumbling down and wasn't sustainable. And should we just really think of this as, look, like it takes a while to turn around a money center bank and 2026 may have been the target in 2022, but we're going to get there in 2027, 2028 anyway, and just doing this in a sustainable way, and we're not robbing the bank of investments.",year,ERIKA NAJARIAN,Analyst,11,Q and A,Q4_2024,2025-01-15,Citigroup,transcript,"ERIKA NAJARIAN (Analyst)

It got done December 1, that was over 100 regulatory approvals to get that done. Now we have turned our full attention to the IPO. We're getting ready to be able to IPO as soon we can. But given market conditions and given regulatory approvals, it's possible this could go into 2026, but we're doing everything in our control to be ready as soon as possible.

"And just in terms of the impact and the timing that Jane referenced, just keep in in mind that the financial impact of exiting Banamex comes two forms. One is the gain or loss on sale and two is the risk-weighted asset release. The gain or loss on sale will run through the P&L at deconsolidation, so that's the point where we've gotten, or we've IPO-ed more than the 50%. And the ultimate benefit will be driven by the RWA release when we fully divest our stake. And so hopefully, that helps, but it's not until we’ve deconsolidated that we see that P&L impact and the CTA and other things like that kind of flow through the P&L for Banamex.",year,MARK MASON,CFO,12,Q and A,Q4_2024,2025-01-15,Citigroup,transcript,"MARK MASON (CFO)

"There'll obviously be important filings associated with that given our intent to dual list, there will be regulatory approvals that are required kind of as we make headway with potential investors as part of the IPO process.

"And so all of those factors are important. And then how the IPO occurs in terms of percentage that is taken on at that first tranche versus follow-on tranches are important factors on when we get to deconsolidation. And so I haven't given you an exact timing on that but you can envision kind of 15% tranches that happen over kind of a 12-, 18-month, 24-month period. And then obviously reaching a point of deconsolidation at which point that currency translation adjustment starts to flow through the P&L. There's no material impact on capital, but it does flow through the P&L.

"Well, I appreciate the insights. And then as a follow-up question, and I really don't mean this as a ‘what have you done for me lately?’ type of question because you guys have made so much progress in what you're doing in your strategic changes here. But can you talk about the U.S. Personal Banking, many of your questions today is about the RoTCE consolidated and how you can improve that, and this business has a very low RoTCE as you guys know, below your cost of capital. And structurally, when you look at it, if you look at the loans at the end of period just over $220 billion, your deposits about $90 billion, which is quite a bit different than your peers who have much higher ROEs. So how do you approach this business? And again, I know you've been very busy divesting a lot of the businesses that are not important, but it seems to me that this is a giant hurdle that you guys have to approach at some point in the near future.",year,GERARD CASSIDY,Analyst,13,Q and A,Q4_2024,2025-01-15,Citigroup,transcript,"GERARD CASSIDY (Analyst)

"Let me just chat a bit through this. So what’s the path to the higher returns in U.S. Personal Banking, it’s coming from top line revenue growth, improved expense base and also a lot more normalized credit environment, and that gets us to the mid- to high-teen returns in the medium term. I think we feel very confident and comfortable in that.

"Mark, the NII ex-Markets outlook, if I just take the fourth quarter and annualize that, I get to something in the neighborhood of, I think, around $47.4 billion, $47.5 billion which is above the full year 2024 level. I'm not sure exactly what “up modestly” means, if that's 1%, 3%, 4%, but, and correct me if you think I’m wrong, but it seems like maybe there's a little bit of conservatism built in? If you can just comment on how you think, and how we should think about the quarterly trajectory of NI ex-Markets?

"I mean, why don't I just kind of cut to the chase on it a little bit, Saul, in the sense that, “up modestly”, call it a couple of percentage points, 2 to 3 percentage points or so, right, in terms of how I think about it. And I think I've taken, I’ve gone through kind of the tailwinds and headwinds, so I won't kind of take you through that again. But I think the important takeaway should be that we're going to see continued momentum across the franchise driven by loan growth in the Branded Card side of the business and continued deposit momentum, particularly operating deposits in Services. And we're going to do everything that we always do around the management of pricing, and we'll get a benefit from how we've been managing our investment portfolio as those things mature. The combination of those efforts will offset, more than offset some of the headwinds that you'd expect in a declining rate environment, and modestly is, call it, 2% to 3%.",year,MARK MASON,CFO,14,Q and A,Q4_2024,2025-01-15,Citigroup,transcript,"MARK MASON (CFO)

"Okay. Fair enough. And then on the expense outlook getting to below $53 billion in 2026, I know that's consistent with what you've said in the past, does imply a pretty sharp reduction in 2026, especially in light of continued revenue growth, it's pretty material operating leverage. Just I mean, how much benefit do you get from a more normalized severance? In other words, how much are we thinking about severance coming down? What's sort of the impact or how to think about the Legacy, stranded costs coming down? Just maybe a little bit more meat on the bone in terms of how much these items will benefit 2026 versus 2025?",year,SAUL MARTINEZ,Analyst,14,Q and A,Q4_2024,2025-01-15,Citigroup,transcript,"SAUL MARTINEZ (Analyst)

"Look, a couple of things. As I look at our severance costs, which, as I mentioned, has been running high, it was $700 million, we're forecasting $600 million in 2025. I think kind of normal through the cycle is probably, call it, $300 million or so.

"I think the other thing is, if you look at the other page, and again, there are a number of drivers or levers that we intend to pull to bring that down. But in the All Other page where you look to the right, we show wind-downs and what's remaining in terms of Legacy Franchise. If you add those numbers together, $1.9 billion or so of expenses and think about a subset of that being stranded. And we're going to continue to focus on how do we bring down stranded costs over the next couple of years.",year,MARK MASON,CFO,15,Q and A,Q4_2024,2025-01-15,Citigroup,transcript,"MARK MASON (CFO)

"So those are two important factors or contributors to the decline from the slightly lower than $53.8 billion to the $53 billion. There are additional productivity saves from prior investments that we've made. But those are important factors. And then as we look at the Transformation spend, that will continue to, or start to pay dividends or help to bring down costs as well. So you've got really those four variables that contribute to us bringing that number down. And as Jane has mentioned, we're going to even post 2026, continue to bring, or drive out more inefficiencies around the organization to fund required investments for the business growth and all with a continued focus on getting to less than 60% as we exit 2026, less than 60% operating efficiency.",year,MARK MASON,CFO,15,Q and A,Q4_2024,2025-01-15,Citigroup,transcript,"MARK MASON (CFO)

And so you'd imagine there's some movement, at least for the 2026 in terms of those targets, Banking will likely be a little bit lower than the mid-15%, if I think about 2026 as being that medium-term target date. But over time, I expect that the targets that I've set are the targets that we will achieve and even more because, as Jane mentioned, 10% to 11%, while that's our 2026 target, it is not our longer-term target as we think about RoTCE and the strength of these businesses in the aggregate franchise.

"Finally, you may have noticed that our effective tax rate has increased this quarter and it will likely stay around 23% this year absent discrete items, which can vary quite a bit. The driver of this change is the firm's adoption of the proportional amortization method for certain tax equity investments.

"And so, you're asking a pertinent question. So, we're earning a lot of money. Our capital cup runneth over, and that's why we've increased the dividend. And if you're asking me what we'd like to do is to pay out something like a third, a third of normalized earnings. Of course, it's hard to calculate always what normalized earnings are, but we don't mind being a little bit ahead of that sometimes, a little bit behind that sometimes.",quarter,Jamie Dimon,CEO,4,Q and A,Q1_2024,2024-04-12,JPMorgan,transcript,"Jamie Dimon (CEO)

"Hey. Good morning. Jeremy, can you speak to the trends you're seeing with respect to deposit migration in the quarter, if there's been any change?

JPMorgan, Q1, 2024 Earnings Call Transcript, Page 6"
"Yeah. Good question, Jim. I think the simplest and best answer to that is: not really. So, as we've been saying for a while, migration from checking and savings to CDs is sort of the dominant trend with this driving the increase in weighted average rate paid in the consumer deposit franchise, that continues. We continue to capture that money-in-motion at a very high rate. We're very happy about what that means about the consumer franchise and level of engagement that we're seeing.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,6,Q and A,Q1_2024,2024-04-12,JPMorgan,transcript,"Jeremy Barnum (CFO)

I'm aware that there's a little bit of a narrative out there about are we seeing the end of what people sometimes refer to as cash sorting. We've looked at that data. We see some evidence that maybe it's slowing a little bit. We're quite cautious on that. We really sort of don't think it makes sense to assume that in a world where checking and savings is paying effectively zero and the policy rate is above 5% that you're not going to see ongoing migration.,quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,6,Q and A,Q1_2024,2024-04-12,JPMorgan,transcript,"Jeremy Barnum (CFO)

"And frankly, we expect to see that even in a world where – even if the current yield curve environment were to change and meaningful cuts were to get reintroduced and we would actually start to see those, we would still expect to see ongoing migration and yield-seeking behavior. So, it's quite conceivable and this is actually on the yield curve that we had in fourth quarter that had six cuts in it. We were still nonetheless expecting an increase in weighted average rate paid as that migration continues. So, I would say no meaningful change in the trends and the expectation for ongoing migration is very much still there.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,6,Q and A,Q1_2024,2024-04-12,JPMorgan,transcript,"Jeremy Barnum (CFO)

"Okay. And just a follow-up on that and just sort of bigger picture on NII. Is that sort of the biggest driver of your outlook? Is it migration? Is it the forward curve? Is it balances? It sounds like it's migration, but just I'd be curious to hear your thoughts on the biggest drivers of upside or downside.",quarter,Jim Mitchell,Analyst,6,Q and A,Q1_2024,2024-04-12,JPMorgan,transcript,"Jim Mitchell (Analyst)

"Yeah. So, I mean I think the drivers of, let's say, what's embedded in the current guidance is actually not meaningfully different from what it was in the fourth quarter, meaning it's the current yield curve, which is a little bit stale now. But the snap from quarter-end had roughly three cuts in it. So, it's the current yield curve, it's what I just said, the expectation of ongoing internal migration. There is some meaningful offset from Card revolve growth, which while it's a little bit less than it was in prior years, is still a tailwind there.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,6,Q and A,Q1_2024,2024-04-12,JPMorgan,transcript,"Jeremy Barnum (CFO)

"We expect deposit balances to be sort of flat to modestly down, so that's a little bit of a headwind at the margin. And then, there's obviously the wild card of potential product level reprice, which we always say we're going to make those decisions situationally as a function of competitive conditions in the marketplace, and you know this obviously, but in a world where we've got something like $900 billion of deposits paying effectively zero, relatively small changes in the product level reprice can change the NII run rate by a lot. So, the error bands here are pretty wide, and we're always going to stick with our mantra, which has been not losing primary bank relationships and thinking about the long-term health of the franchise when we think about deposit pricing.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,6,Q and A,Q1_2024,2024-04-12,JPMorgan,transcript,"Jeremy Barnum (CFO)

"Thanks. Jeremy, you had mentioned at a conference earlier this year that the Street might need to build in more reserve growth – for the Card growth, you've had more reserve build.

"Yeah, John. So, in short, yes to both questions. So, yes, the relative lack of build this quarter is a function of the normal seasonal patterns of Card. Yes, we still expect 12% Card loan growth for the full year. And yes, that still means that all else equal, we think the consensus for the allowance build for the back three quarters is still a little too low, if you map it to that expected Card loan growth.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,7,Q and A,Q1_2024,2024-04-12,JPMorgan,transcript,"Jeremy Barnum (CFO)

"Okay. Got it. And then just to follow up to make it super clear on the idea of the Markets NII, that outlook being revised down by $1 billion but revenue neutral. I guess, the obvious thing is, there, there's typically an offset in fee income and you don't guide to that.

"That is exactly right. And specifically, what's going on here is there's shift between on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet in the financing businesses and prime and so on within Markets.

"So, fundamentally, you can think of it as like we either hold the equities on the balance sheet, non-interest-bearing, high-funding expense, negative for NII, or we receive that in total return form through derivatives, exactly the same economics, no impact on NII. So, that shift is a function of the sort of borrowing relationships in the marketplace in ways that are bottom line effectively neutral. It's second order effects, but they change the geography quite a bit, and that's what happened this quarter. And that's why we've been emphasizing for some time that the NII ex.

"Right. So, interesting framing of the question, Erika. So, I think we've been pretty consistent about where we're over-earning, right? So, obviously, one major area is that we're over-earning in deposit margin, especially in consumer and that's sort of why we're expecting sequential declines in NII, why we've talked about compressing deposit margins and increases in weighted average rate paid. So, I think that's probably the single biggest source of, let's call it, excess earnings currently.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,9,Q and A,Q1_2024,2024-04-12,JPMorgan,transcript,"Jeremy Barnum (CFO)

"You also have heard Jamie say that we're over-earning in credit. I mean, Wholesale charge-offs have been particularly low, but we have builds for that. So, in the current run rate, a bit less clear the extent of what we're earning. And in Card, of course, while charge-offs are now close to normalized essentially, we did go through an extended period of charge-offs being very low by historical standards, although that was coupled with NII also being low by historical standards. So, from a bottom line perspective, it's not entirely clear what the net of that was.

We will optimize, we will seek to reprice, we will adjust in various ways to the best of our ability. But given the structure of the rule as proposed at least, a lot of this cannot be optimized away.

And so, we cautioned a little bit there about pull-forward.

And I just use some of your own numbers from the past of like, the market has added like $40 trillion of equity market cap and $40 trillion of fixed income market cap last 10 years, yet the wallet is like 20% plus below the 10-year average.

"Yeah, Glenn. In short, yes. I mean, I think we're not shy about saying that we're under-earning in Investment Banking right now. Clearly, we're below cycle averages, as you point out. We've been talking about when do we get back to the pre-pandemic wallet? But as you know, I mean on this point, what it was, like March 2020, right, was the beginning of the pandemic. So, it's like four years ago at this point. So, there has been GDP growth, especially in nominal terms during that period, and you would expect the wallet to growth with that.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,13,Q and A,Q1_2024,2024-04-12,JPMorgan,transcript,"Jeremy Barnum (CFO)

"Sure. So, I think the first thing to say which is somewhat obvious but I'm going to say it anyway is that, there are some like auto-governors in this, right? Like some portion of the expense base is directly related to revenue, whether it's volume-related commissions, whether it's incentive compensation, whether it's other things. So, there are some auto-correcting elements of the expense base that would happen automatically as part of the normal discipline.

"Point two is that, independently of the environment, we are always looking for efficiencies.

So, I think what Jamie was sort of suggesting is that, you can think of the concept as kind of like strategic capital versus tactical capital for lack of a better term. And what he's kind of saying is that, in a moment where you're carrying a lot of excess capital sort of for strategic reasons, you have the ability at least in theory to deploy portions of that with kind of like – into relatively short-duration assets or strategies or client opportunities in whatever moment for whatever reason, and what might be thought of as a tactical sense.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,14,Q and A,Q1_2024,2024-04-12,JPMorgan,transcript,"Jeremy Barnum (CFO)

"But for sure, one thing that's true is the higher run rate of the Markets businesses as a whole that we talked about a second ago, is linked also to higher deployment of balance sheet into those businesses. So, as you well know, we pride ourselves on being extremely analytical and extremely disciplined in how we analyze capital liquidity, balance sheet deployment, GSIB capacity utilization, et cetera, in the Markets business.

"So – that we still are operating under multiple binding constraints. And obviously, the environment is complex, so the ability to sort of throw a ton of capital at opportunities is not quite that simple always.

"And I think the single most notable thing is just this effect, where in the – while it is true that real incomes have gone up in the lowest income cohorts, within that there's obviously a probability distribution. And there's some – or rather just a distribution of outcomes. And there are some set of people whose real incomes are not up, they're down, and who are therefore struggling a little bit unfortunately.

"Right. So, I think what's true about spreads in general, just broadly credit spreads including secondary markets and to some extent the leverage lending space, is that they are exceptionally tight. So, I'm sure that's reversed a little bit in the last few days. But broadly throughout the quarter, we've really seen credit spreads tighten quite a bit. You even see that a little bit in our OCI this quarter, where losses in OCI that we would've had from higher rates have been meaningfully offset by tighter credit spreads in the portfolio. So broadly, sort of in keeping with the big run-up that we saw in equity markets and the general sort of bullish tone, you saw quite a bit of credit spread tightening in secondary markets.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,15,Q and A,Q1_2024,2024-04-12,JPMorgan,transcript,"Jeremy Barnum (CFO)

"That, I think, has manifested itself a little bit in the leverage lending space in the normal way that it does, and that there's a lot of competition among providers for the revenue pool, and you start to see a little bit of loosening of terms which always makes us a little bit concerned. And as we have in the past, we are going to be very well prepared to lose share in that space if we don't like the terms. We never compromise on structure there. So, you are seeing a little bit of that.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,15,Q and A,Q1_2024,2024-04-12,JPMorgan,transcript,"Jeremy Barnum (CFO)

"I think that, away from the leverage lending space in the broader C&I space, there was a moment a few months ago where I think, in no small part, as a result of banks generally anticipating this more challenging capital environment and sort of disciplining a little bit their lending, you're seeing a little bit of widening actually in those corporate lending spreads. I don't know if that trend has like survived over the last few weeks, and it was little bit hard to observe in any case.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,15,Q and A,Q1_2024,2024-04-12,JPMorgan,transcript,"Jeremy Barnum (CFO)

"But I would say broadly, the dynamics are the tension between people trying to be careful with their balance sheets and the fact that overall asset prices and conditions are quite supportive and secondary market credit spreads have rallied a lot.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,15,Q and A,Q1_2024,2024-04-12,JPMorgan,transcript,"Jeremy Barnum (CFO)

"Thank you. And I guess, as a tie-in to that question and answer, we've read and seen so much about the private credit growth in this country by private credit companies. Can you give us some color on what you're seeing there, both as a competitor, but also as a client of JPMorgan? How you balance the two out, where you may see them bidding on business that you'd like but at the same time you're supporting their business?",quarter,Gerard Cassidy,Analyst,16,Q and A,Q1_2024,2024-04-12,JPMorgan,transcript,"Gerard Cassidy (Analyst)

"Right. Yeah. I mean, I think that tension between us as a provider of secured financing to some portions of the private credit, private equity community, you're talking about different parts of the capital structure. But we do recognize that we compete in some areas and we are clients of each other in other areas, and that's part of the franchise and it's all good at some level.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,16,Q and A,Q1_2024,2024-04-12,JPMorgan,transcript,"Jeremy Barnum (CFO)
JPMorgan, Q1, 2024 Earnings Call Transcript, Page 16"
"But narrowly, on private credit, it is interesting to observe what's going on there. So I would say, for us, the strategy there is very much to be product agnostic actually. It's not so much like, oh, is it private credit or is it syndicated lending? It's, what does it take to be good at this stuff? And what it takes is, stuff that we have and have always had and that we're very good at in each individual silo. So, you need underwriting skill, structuring skill, origination, distribution, secondary trading, risk appetite, credit analysis capabilities. And this is what we do and we're really good at it.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,16,Q and A,Q1_2024,2024-04-12,JPMorgan,transcript,"Jeremy Barnum (CFO)
JPMorgan, Q1, 2024 Earnings Call Transcript, Page 16"
"And increasingly, what you see actually is that, as you see us doing a little bit, as the private credit space gets bigger, it starts to make sense to actually bring in some co-lenders so that you can sort of do big enough deals without having undue concentration risks. I mean, even if you have the capital, you just may not want the concentration risk.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,16,Q and A,Q1_2024,2024-04-12,JPMorgan,transcript,"Jeremy Barnum (CFO)
JPMorgan, Q1, 2024 Earnings Call Transcript, Page 16"
"And so, in a funny way, the private credit space becomes a little bit more like the syndicated lending space. And at the same time, the syndicated lending space being influenced a little bit by these private credit unitranche structures, gets pushed a little bit in the private credit direction in terms of like speed of execution and other aspects of how that business works. So, we're watching it. The competitive dynamics are interesting. Certainly, there's some pressure in some areas. But we really do think that our overall value proposition and competitive position here is second to none, and so we're looking forward to the future here.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,16,Q and A,Q1_2024,2024-04-12,JPMorgan,transcript,"Jeremy Barnum (CFO)

"Good morning. A couple of questions on the First Republic acquisition. Some of us obviously thought that would be a homerun, and I'm glad to see that Jamie Dimon validated that in his annual letter. When you look at the first quarter, it annualizes out to $2.7 billion, $2.8 billion, above the $2 billion that Jamie published in the letter. I know you don't want to extrapolate that.",quarter,Charles W. Peabody,Analyst,16,Q and A,Q1_2024,2024-04-12,JPMorgan,transcript,"Charles W. Peabody (Analyst)
JPMorgan, Q1, 2024 Earnings Call Transcript, Page 16"
"But can you remind us what sort of cost savings you still have in that, because this quarter did see expenses come down to $800 million down from $900 million? And then, secondly, is there an offset to that where the accretion becomes less and less and that's why you don't want to extrapolate the $2.7 billion, $2.8 billion? So, that's my first question.",quarter,Charles W. Peabody,Analyst,16,Q and A,Q1_2024,2024-04-12,JPMorgan,transcript,"Charles W. Peabody (Analyst)
JPMorgan, Q1, 2024 Earnings Call Transcript, Page 16"
"Okay. Thanks, Charlie. And I'm going to do my best to answer your question, while sticking to my sort of guns on not giving too much First Republic specific guidance. But I do think that the kind of framework you're articulating is broadly correct. So, let me go through the pieces.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,17,Q and A,Q1_2024,2024-04-12,JPMorgan,transcript,"Jeremy Barnum (CFO)
JPMorgan, Q1, 2024 Earnings Call Transcript, Page 17"
"So yes, the current quarter's results annualized to more than the $2 billion Jamie talked about. Yes, a big part of that reason is discount accretion which was very frontloaded as a result of short-dated assets. So, that's part of the reason that you see that converge. Yes, it's also true that we expect the expense run rate to decline later in the year as we continue making progress on integration. Obviously, as I think as I mentioned to you last quarter, from a full year perspective you just have the offset of the full year calendarization effect.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,17,Q and A,Q1_2024,2024-04-12,JPMorgan,transcript,"Jeremy Barnum (CFO)
JPMorgan, Q1, 2024 Earnings Call Transcript, Page 17"
"There's maybe an embedded question in there, too, about we had talked about $2.5 billion of integration expense. And the integration is real, the expenses are real, and also the time spent on that is quite real. It's a lot of work for a lot of people. It's going well, but we're not done yet; and it takes a lot of effort.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,17,Q and A,Q1_2024,2024-04-12,JPMorgan,transcript,"Jeremy Barnum (CFO)
JPMorgan, Q1, 2024 Earnings Call Transcript, Page 17"
"But broadly, I think that our expectations for integration expense are probably coming in a bit lower than we originally assumed on the morning of the deal, for a couple of reasons. One is that the framework around the time was understandably quite conservative and sort of assumes that we would kind of lose a meaningful portion of the franchise, and would sort of need to size the expense base accordingly. And of course, it's worked out, to your point, quite a bit better than that. And therefore, the amount of expenses that is necessary to keep this bigger franchise is higher. And that means, less integration expense associated with taking down those numbers.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,17,Q and A,Q1_2024,2024-04-12,JPMorgan,transcript,"Jeremy Barnum (CFO)
JPMorgan, Q1, 2024 Earnings Call Transcript, Page 17"
"It's probably also true that the integration assumptions were conservative. They were based on kind of more typical type of bank M&A assumptions as opposed to the particular nature of this deal including the FDIC and so on and so forth. So, yeah, I think that probably is a pretty complete answer to your question. Thanks, Charlie.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,17,Q and A,Q1_2024,2024-04-12,JPMorgan,transcript,"Jeremy Barnum (CFO)
JPMorgan, Q1, 2024 Earnings Call Transcript, Page 17"
"As a quick follow-up. Where are the next homeruns going to come from? And this is more strategic beyond just JPMorgan, but there are probably going to be more regional bank failures, whether it's this year or next year, and opportunities to pick those up. But what you're seeing is that, private equity and family offices are setting up to participate in this next round of bank failures. Mnuchin's buying of NYCB is clearly to create a platform for rollups of failed banks, and then there are other family offices that have filed shelf registrations for bank holding companies whose specific purpose is to buy failed banks.",quarter,Charles W.

JPMorgan, Q1, 2024 Earnings Call Transcript, Page 17"
"So, do you think that these opportunities are going to be competed away by private credit? And as part of that, do you think the regulators are going to view private credit as a different party and less attractive party versus bank takeovers of failed banks? So, that's my question.",quarter,Charles W. Peabody,Analyst,17,Q and A,Q1_2024,2024-04-12,JPMorgan,transcript,"Charles W. Peabody (Analyst)
JPMorgan, Q1, 2024 Earnings Call Transcript, Page 17"
"Right. Okay, Charlie. There's a lot in there. And to be honest, I just don't love the idea of spending a lot of time on this call speculating about bank failures. You obviously have a particular view about the next wave in the landscape. I'm not going to bother debating that with you.

"As we talked about earlier, we have a lot of capital. And as Jamie says, the capital is earnings in store, and right now we don't see a lot of really compelling opportunities to deploy the capital. But if opportunities arise despite the uncertainty about the Basel III Endgame, we will be well positioned to deploy it. I think embedded there is also sort of a question about the FDIC and the FDIC's attitude towards different types of bidders, and obviously there's a lot of thinking and analysis happening about the entire process and some recent forums and speeches on bank resolution and so on and so forth.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,17,Q and A,Q1_2024,2024-04-12,JPMorgan,transcript,"Jeremy Barnum (CFO)
JPMorgan, Q1, 2024 Earnings Call Transcript, Page 17"
"And I think probably we can all agree that it's better, all else equal for the system, to have as much capital available and as many different types of capital available to ensure that things are stabilized if anything ever goes wrong. But the mechanics of how you do that when you're talking about banks are not trivial and not to be underestimated.

"I think on the consumer side, the thing to check is the spending data. And to be honest, the main thing that we see there, what would appear to be a certain amount of frontloading of spending ahead of people expecting price increases from tariffs. So ironically, that's actually somewhat supportive, all else equal. But I think what it sort of highlights is that during this transitional period and this elevated uncertainty, you might see some distortions in the data that make it hard to draw larger conclusions.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,4,Q and A,Q1_2025,2025-04-11,JPMorgan,transcript,"Jeremy Barnum (CFO)

"I do think you see obvious differences across sectors. Some sectors are going to be much more exposed than others and have more complicated problems to solve.

I think the larger corporates have a bit more experience dealing with these things and more resources to manage. So that's a little bit our read of the situation right now.

"Yeah, that's a good question, Ken. You're right. So if you remember, last quarter we said that we had one cut in the curve. I think latest curve has something like three cuts. And so, we've talked a lot, obviously, about how we are asset sensitive. You now see our EaR disclosed in the supplement, and probably our empirical EaR is a little bit higher than our modeled EaR as a result of the relatively low – lower than modeled rates paid in Consumer. So when you put that together, all else equal, the drop in the weighted-average IORB, which is about 22 basis points, should produce a notable headwind in our NII ex.

"Yes. Good morning. This question is for Jamie. Jamie, you were on the media today talking about potential economic turbulence. But Jeremy also mentioned that banking should be – the banking system should be a source of strength in this turbulence.

"I just – before Jamie answers that, Erika, I just want to make one brief comment, which is the banking system being a source of strength means what it says. In other words, banks doing their job to support the economy. That's not a statement about bank equity performance and the extent to which banks are cyclical or not. Like obviously, a recessionary environment, as I've frequently said, all else equal, is bad for banks  from an equity performance perspective.

"And I think the one thing I'll add to what Jeremy said is – and I don't usually pay that much attention to anecdotes, but this time I am. And I think you're going to see a lot of companies – you guys – not you, but the analyst community has already reduced its earnings estimates for the S&P by 5%. So it's – now it's up 5% as opposed to up 10%.

"And then you're going to hear 1,000 companies report, and they're going to tell you what their guidance is. My guess is a lot will remove it. They're going to tell you what they think it might do to their customers, their base, their earnings, their cost, their tariffs. It's different for every company. But I assume you'll see that. And anecdotally, a lot of people are not doing things because of this. They're going to wait and see. And that's M&A, that's M&A with middle market companies, that's people's hiring plans and stuff like that. So people have to adjust to this new environment.

"I just also want to point out, just to – so you can round it up. This is to make you feel comfortable, not uncomfortable. When COVID hit, unemployment went from like 4% to 15% in a couple of months, and we had to add to reserves in a two-month period of $15 billion. And then to show you how stupid CECL is, in the three month – three quarter period, we took down the $15 billion. So, just – that just sizes up a bad recession. If it's a mild recession, it will be less than that. If it's a really bad recession, it will be more than that. Either way, we can handle it and serve our clients. Earnings won't be great and the stocks will go down, which I look at as an opportunity to buy back more stock.",quarter,Jamie Dimon,CEO,6,Q and A,Q1_2025,2025-04-11,JPMorgan,transcript,"Jamie Dimon (CEO)

Got it. And a second follow-up question. And I don't disagree with you guys on equity market performance of bank stocks.

"And to that point, the second question is on the reserve. Jeremy, you mentioned a weighted-average unemployment rate of 5.8%. I think that's above where economists are thinking we could peak even in a recession scenario. How should we think about any incremental builds from here? And what you are going – obviously, deterioration in the outlook, but what more do you need to see in terms of how you make decisions about further builds from here?",quarter,Erika Najarian,Analyst,6,Q and A,Q1_2025,2025-04-11,JPMorgan,transcript,"Erika Najarian (Analyst)

"As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, the [indiscernible] forecast at the end of the quarter was the sort of bog standard, no landing, barely any increase in unemployment. Given that we knew at the time that there was – there were some big pending announcements, and there was quite a bit of elevated uncertainty around that, it felt like the forecasts were kind of lagging because people were just waiting to actually get the information and so it felt appropriate to add a little bit of downside skew to our probability assessment, which is what led to the increase and what led to the build.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,6,Q and A,Q1_2025,2025-04-11,JPMorgan,transcript,"Jeremy Barnum (CFO)

"Yeah, it's a good question and we're seeing that too. So let me talk about travel. I mean we obviously saw the airlines discuss what they are seeing as headwinds for them, specifically in airline travel, and we're seeing that too through the card spend. It's not obvious to us that that's necessarily an indicator for broader patterns.

"And as I mentioned previously, another thing that we are seeing looking at the April data is what would appear to be a little bit of front-loading of spending, specifically in items that might be – have prices go up as a function of tariffs. So you see people behaving rationally, and I have noted even you hear anecdotes, and I've seen evidence of companies specifically advertising we have pre-tariff inventory and so on and so forth.

"The other thing that people are kind of interested in this space is like what's happening by income band, because we have seen some of the retailers and other folks talking about weaknesses in the lower income segment. And I think when we look at our Card data and also our cash buffers and peoples' checking accounts, of course, it is true that it is relatively weaker in the lower income segment. But when you take a step back and you ask, are we seeing signs of distress in the lower income segment? The answer is no. So, sure, the margin and cash buffers are lower, and you see some rotation of spend and spending is a little bit weaker than it was in the peak spending moments. But actually, some of the increases in spending that we're seeing in April are actually coming from the lower income segment.

"Hi. Good morning and thanks for taking my questions. Wanted to start off with one on the proposed SLR changes and just the impact of rate volatility. The Treasury is committed to providing relief to the banks under the SLR just to help mitigate some of the volatility in the 10-year. But given the geopolitical concerns, weakening global demand for treasuries, how does it inform your appetite just for purchasing U.S. Treasuries if those reforms are implemented and just how you're managing rate risk maybe more holistically across the Firm, just in light of some the recent volatility?",quarter,Steven Chubak,Analyst,10,Q and A,Q1_2025,2025-04-11,JPMorgan,transcript,"Steven Chubak (Analyst)
JPMorgan, Q1, 2025 Earnings Call Transcript, Page 10"
"Yes. So SLR alone isn't going to change that much for us. It may change for other people. We really need reform across SLR, G-SIFI, CCAR, Basel III and LCR, all of which have deep flaws in them to make a material change.",quarter,Jamie Dimon,CEO,10,Q and A,Q1_2025,2025-04-11,JPMorgan,transcript,"Jamie Dimon (CEO)
JPMorgan, Q1, 2025 Earnings Call Transcript, Page 10"
"And remember, it's not relief to the banks; it's relief to the markets. JPMorgan will be fine with/without an SLR change. The reason to change some of these things is so banks – the big market makers could intermediate more in the markets. If they don't – if they do, spreads will come in, there'll be more active traders. If they don't, the Fed will have to intermediate, which I think is just a bad policy idea that every time there's a kerfuffle in the markets, the Fed has to come in and intermediate. So they should make these changes.",quarter,Jamie Dimon,CEO,10,Q and A,Q1_2025,2025-04-11,JPMorgan,transcript,"Jamie Dimon (CEO)
JPMorgan, Q1, 2025 Earnings Call Transcript, Page 10"
"The point – the reason why is when you have very – a lot of volatile markets and very wide spreads and low liquidity in treasuries, it affects all other capital markets. That's the reason to do it; not as a favor to the banks themselves. And we don't take more interest rate exposure to this in any way, shape or form. So it's not like we're going to change our position. We intermediate in the markets to help clients do what they have to do. And if the banks could take bigger positions, they would have just larger dealer positions and take no – basically take not much more interest rate exposure. I should say that our folks did a fabulous job trading this quarter.",quarter,Jamie Dimon,CEO,10,Q and A,Q1_2025,2025-04-11,JPMorgan,transcript,"Jamie Dimon (CEO)
JPMorgan, Q1, 2025 Earnings Call Transcript, Page 10"
"And Steve, all I would add to that is that it is, of course, true, and we all remember the moment a few years ago when intermediaries were, in fact, bound by SLR as a result of the expansion of the deposit base, and extraordinary actions needed to be taken to address that. So we've seen when it is binding, and it works not as designed, which is why we do very much agree that it should be fixed.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,10,Q and A,Q1_2025,2025-04-11,JPMorgan,transcript,"Jeremy Barnum (CFO)

"Thank you both for that perspective. And just for my follow-up, did want to ask on the Markets outlook. So, admittedly, less surprising to hear some of the cautious IB commentary in light of the uncertainty. But was hoping you could just speak to the Markets businesses which have been performing extraordinarily well of late and just given the combination of elevated volatility, but also some indications that clients are taking down risk, how you expect that business to perform over the coming quarters.",quarter,Steven Chubak,Analyst,11,Q and A,Q1_2025,2025-04-11,JPMorgan,transcript,"Steven Chubak (Analyst)

"Yeah. It's a good question. As you know, Steve, we're obviously not going to give Markets guidance. Your guess is as good as ours at some level. But the ingredients are the right ingredients. I mean, we've often discussed about how this business, all else equal, benefits from a volatile environment if markets are operating relatively normally, which they more or less have been. Of course, it's not guaranteed. We need to do a good job managing the risk. And yeah, there are states of the world where if our clients are struggling or deleveraging or taking down risk, that could be a headwind for us. So we're going to just do what we always do and try to manage the risk well and serve our clients, but we were certainly happy to see the performance this quarter.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,11,Q and A,Q1_2025,2025-04-11,JPMorgan,transcript,"Jeremy Barnum (CFO)

"And I would say that when we talk about the financial system being a source – the banking system being a source of strength in this environment, part of what we're talking about is our commitment and willingness to lend through cycles, as we've always done in the past and that we have the underwriting capability and the capital and the liquidity and the experience to be reliable lenders in serving our clients no matter what type of environment we're in.

I think the best thing to do is to allow the Secretary of Treasury and the folks working with him and the administration to finish as quick as possible the agreements that they need to make with – around tariffs and with our trading partners. And I think there'll be agreements in principle. They're not going to be – trade agreements themselves would be 5,000 or 10,000 pages long. And that's the best way to go about it right now.

"So maybe when we're doing this call next quarter, we won't have to be guessing. We'll actually know what the effect of some of these things was with some predictability and stuff like that. But it's – the result in a bank is almost always the same, which is volatile markets, credit losses go up, people get more conservative, investments go down, what looks like a recession. Is it mild or hard? I don't know and – but we are – I've been quite cautious, and you can see in our capital, our liquidity, our position, our balance sheet. And so we're prepared.

I'm going into this because I noticed your average loan growth, I think it was running at about 2% year-on-year. And then end of period loans was up 5% and wholesale loans was up 7%. So I'm just wondering if there was some line drawdowns at quarter end. And it's a broader question on just liquidity. Do you see your customers looking for more liquidity? Are they drawing down lines? And maybe if you could speak to liquidity in the front end of the market, that would be helpful, too. Thank you.",quarter,Betsy L.

"Yeah, it's a good question, Betsy. So a couple of things. One is in our soundings of our wholesale clients during sort of the moments of peak uncertainty, we did hear them talking about wanting to focus on shoring up liquidity. Interestingly, I actually asked the question like a day ago, whether we were seeing draws, meaningfully observable draws from clients. And the answer to that question was no, at least not yet. So, I don't know what to make of that, but perhaps it suggests that we do not see that level of heightened anxiety that people are more just focusing on addressing their supply chain issues right now.

And I don't – I wouldn't expect an expense drawdown that you're going to see. There will be thousands – hundreds of people, maybe, but it's not going to be passed on.

It is also LCR, it is also G-SIFI, also – and the question you should ask because you are very smart, Mike, is could you have the same – and I believe you have a safer system, lend more money, have more liquidity, eliminate bank runs, eliminate what happened to First Republic and Silicon Valley, and you could accomplish all of that with completely rational and thoughtful regulations.

The market plumbing has held in okay so far and you and others have had borderline spectacular trading results. So, has something changed? Are the systems better?

"I mean, maybe I'll start with that one, Glenn. So, I guess, I think that your points aren't mutually exclusive. Meaning, I mean, we're always continually improving the franchise. We've talked a lot about inward investment in all of our businesses, including Markets. And so we try to be more complete and invest in technology and work more closely with our clients. So I'm sure we're kind of better at it than we were five years ago, as I think probably everyone is at the margin. I'm not sure that you can associate that with the current performance.

"And to your point, I think your specific question of like is there – are there still forms of volatility that can be bad for the Markets franchise? The answer to that question is definitely yes. When you have gappy volatility with no trading volume, people paralyzed, clients unsure what to do, active managers struggling, those environments are bad. So people make fun of the kind of good volatility, bad volatility story, but whether we like it or not, it's real. And in the end, we just have to manage the risks and serve the clients.

"Jeremy – I agree. Jeremy, I would add to that. Volatility leads to bigger bid-ask spreads, that, all things being equal, is better. And it leads sometimes to higher volumes. So you've seen really high volumes in FX and interest rate swaps, a whole bunch of different things, treasuries. That's better. But as Jeremy pointed out, sometimes that kind of volatility leads to very low volumes, like you see in DCM today when you don't have these bond deals where you have less trading, when you have – so it will have lower volumes in certain markets and stuff like that. And how it all filters through is almost impossible to tell. But our folks do a great job and we're here to help our clients.

Everything Jamie's been talking about SLR, LCR, ILST, G-SIB, Basel III Endgame, RWA, the whole panoply of items, which interacts, as we've often talked about and is miss-calibrated, it will, at the margin, make it harder for banks to serve a stabilizing function in a difficult moment.

But I guess how should we think about the cost structure and any sort of cost optimization efforts, if you do see a revenue slowdown, but not necessarily a severe downturn? I think you do have, in the $95 billion guidance, you do have a good amount of growth penciled in for investing in bankers and branches and tech and marketing.

"This quarter, as it happens, a question you might have is how are you managing to keep your guidance the same with what you're saying about, for example, the Investment Banking outlook? But it's worth noting that Investment Banking performance this quarter was actually fine. As you know, Markets performance was very strong. And there are also some ups and downs in there, I should note, including the fact that there is some sensitivity to the expense base to the strength of the dollar, or weakness in this case. And while some of that is offset in revenue, it's a little noisy, so that's a factor as well.

"Narrowly, on the capital one, the one thing to point out is that the straight-up math of simply diluting down the ROTCE by expanding the denominator misses the possibility of reprice, repricing of products and services, which of course goes back to our point that these capital increases do have impacts on the real economy.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,5,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-14,JPMorgan,transcript,"Jeremy Barnum (CFO)

Thanks. Good morning. I just wanted to ask a little bit about how you're feeling about the trade-off between like the commercial economy and what might come through in terms of future loan growth versus the kind of green shoots that people are talking about in the Investment Banking pipeline and just how it feels in terms of like re-opening of markets and the trade-off between getting some more of those fees in versus what's happening on the loan demand side.

"Sure. Good question, Ken. So I think in terms of Investment Banking and Markets, yeah, slightly better than expected last month.

"In terms of the broader economy and loan growth expectations, generally, we do still expect reasonably robust Card loan growth. But away from that for a variety of different reasons and different products, whether it be mortgage or C&I after revolver normalization, and especially if we see a little bit of a cooling off of the economy, I would expect loan demand to be relatively modest there, so we're not really expecting meaningful growth away from Card.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,7,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-14,JPMorgan,transcript,"Jeremy Barnum (CFO)

And is that Card growth continue to be driven by people needing to revolve as opposed to wanting to have more in their deposits?

Like, we've all been worried about the recession for a year and there's a debate about the lagged effects of the Fed rate hike cycle. When you think about – Jeremy, I think you mentioned your unemployment outlook relatively similar today versus a quarter ago – how worried should we be in terms of the credit cycle 6 to 12 months from now?

"Yeah, it's a good question. It's quite a technical issue. So I think in the past, the way this number was constructed was to assume through-the-cycle betas on all the deposits, and so your notion that like the number would include deposit beta acceleration would not have been the case because it would've been using essentially terminal deposit betas based on the forward curve and then based on a 100% shock to the forward curve.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,15,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-14,JPMorgan,transcript,"Jeremy Barnum (CFO)

So as I said in my prepared remarks, yeah, we think about half of the change in the bank LCR number is a consequence of First Republic and the rest of it is just the expected decrease in system-wide deposits flowing through into our HQLA balances and the bank LCR ratio.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,17,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-14,JPMorgan,transcript,"Jeremy Barnum (CFO)

"And I would just add to that – just look at the top of the page in the press release, $1.4 trillion of cash and marketable securities. Even if we get down to no excess, we're going to have like, I forgot the exact number, $1.2 trillion. I think we have excess liquidity, and the liquidity ratio is slightly something different. I think there's plenty of liquidity in the system and, of course, we do multiple things to change this overnight if we wanted to.",quarter,Jamie Dimon,CEO,17,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-14,JPMorgan,transcript,"Jamie Dimon (CEO)

"All right. So sort of wrapped into that as a follow-up, if you take your $87 billion forecast for NII this year, and that implies at least one quarter of maybe $22 billion of NII, and you take your eventual forecast of mid-$70 billion of NII at some point in the future, that would imply at least one quarter of $18 billion of NII so that's about an 18% drop. And if you hold the balance sheet steady, you're talking about a 30-basis point drop in your margin, your NIM, to get from $22 billion to $18 billion. I mean, what is driving – is it really the deposit or are you thinking in terms of interest reversals as credit deteriorates or is it rebuilding of liquidity? I'm just trying to get a better sense of the impact is.",quarter,Charles W. Peabody,Analyst,18,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-14,JPMorgan,transcript,"Charles W. Peabody (Analyst)

"Yeah. Hey, Charlie. I would think about that as being really entirely a deposit story. It's just not that complicated, right? I think we did this – I think it was either in the fourth quarter or in the first quarter – where we put a little chart on a page, just very simple terms, that shows what the dollar consequences are of whatever – like 10-basis point change in deposit rate paid in terms of NII run rate.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,18,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-14,JPMorgan,transcript,"Jeremy Barnum (CFO)

"So whether it's as a consequence of migration from lower-yielding to higher-yielding, going from 0% to a 4% CD is obviously a big impact on margin. Or whether it's because savings reprices, relatively small changes in rate there are kind of a lot of money when you've got a couple trillion dollars of deposits. So it's really not any more complicated than that and that's why we're being so forceful about reminding people about what we expect that trajectory to be.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,18,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-14,JPMorgan,transcript,"Jeremy Barnum (CFO)

"So, wanted to start off with a question on capital just given some indications that the Fed is considering favorable revisions to both Basel III Endgame and the GSIB surcharge calculations, which I know you've been pushing for some time. As you evaluate just different capital scenarios, are these revisions material enough where they could support a higher normalized ROTCE at the Firm versus the 17% target?

"Okay. Good question on the capital and the ROTCE. So, let me start with the ROTCE point first. In short, my answer to that question would be no.

JPMorgan, Q2, 2024 Earnings Call Transcript, Page 4"
"If you think about the way we've been talking about this, we've said that before the Basel III Endgame proposal, we had a 17% through the cycle target, and that while you can imagine a range of different outcomes, the vast majority of them involve expansions of the denominator. And while we had ideas about changing the perimeter and repricing, all of which are still sort of in effect, most of those would be thought of as mitigants rather than things that would actually, like increase the ROTCE.

"So, as of now, that's what I would say, which is a good pivot to the next point, which is, yeah, we've been reading the same press coverage you've been reading and it's fun and interesting to speculate about the potential outcomes here.

"So, maybe I'll just briefly summarize for everyone's benefit what we think that is, which is, one, we do recognize that our current practice on capital return and buybacks does lead to an ever-expanding CET1 ratio. But obviously, we're going to run the company over the cycle over time at a reasonable CET1 ratio with reasonable buffers relative to our requirement. So, after all the uncertainty is sorted out, the question of the deployment of the capital, one way or another, is a matter of when, not if.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,4,Q and A,Q2_2024,2024-07-12,JPMorgan,transcript,"Jeremy Barnum (CFO)

"On the capital hierarchy, it's also worth noting that's another thing that remains unchanged, so I'll review it quickly. Growing the business organically and inorganically, sustainable dividend, and in that context it's worth noting that the board's announced intention to increase it to $1.25 is a 19% increase prior to last year.

"And then, finally buybacks. But that hierarchy does not commit us to return 100% of the capital generation in any given quarter.

"No need to apologize, Jeremy. That was a really helpful perspective. Maybe just for my follow-up on NII, you've been very consistent just in flagging the risk related to NII overearning, especially in light of potential deposit attrition as well as repricing headwinds.

"And our PE seems to have settled in roughly at its current levels, and there are reasons to believe that it might not go down that much more, although that could always change and that could supply extra reserves into the system.

"Hi, thanks very much. So, Jeremy, the discussions so far around private credit and you all, your recent comments have been the ability to add on balance sheet and compete when you need to compete on the private credit front. And I do think that most of the discussion has been about the direct lending component. So, I'm curious if you're showing more progress and activity on that front. And then, very importantly, do you see the same trend happening on the asset-backed finance side because that's a bigger part of the world and it's a bigger part of your business? So, I'd appreciate your thoughts there. Thanks.",quarter,Glenn Schorr,Analyst,7,Q and A,Q2_2024,2024-07-12,JPMorgan,transcript,"Glenn Schorr (Analyst)

"Yeah. Thanks, Glenn. So, on private credit, so nothing really new to say there. I think, I guess, one way the environment's evolving a little bit is, as you know, a lot of money has been raised in private credit funds looking for deals. And sort of a little bit to my prior comment, in a relatively muted acquisition finance environment, at this point you've got a lot of money chasing, like not that many deals. So, the space is a little bit quieter than it was at the margin.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,8,Q and A,Q2_2024,2024-07-12,JPMorgan,transcript,"Jeremy Barnum (CFO)

"Another interesting thing to note is some of this discussion about kind of lender protections that were typical in the syndicated leveraged finance market making their way into the private market as well as sort of people realize that even in the private market you probably need some of those protections in some cases, which is sort of supportive of the theme that we've been talking about, about convergence between the direct lending space and the syndicated lending space, which is kind of our core thesis here, which is that we can offer best-in-class service across the entire continuum, including secondary market trading and so on.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,8,Q and A,Q2_2024,2024-07-12,JPMorgan,transcript,"Jeremy Barnum (CFO)

"And then, on asset-backed financing, you actually asked me that question before, and at the time, my answer was that I hadn't heard much about that trend and that continues to be the case.

"No. That's great for you if you're not hearing much about it, so we can leave it at that. Maybe just one quick follow-up in terms of your just overall posturing. You were patient and smart when rates were low, waited to deploy, worked out great, we know that story. Now, it seems like you have tons of excess liquidity and you're being patient and rates are high, and I'm curious on how you think about what kind of triggers, what kind of things you're looking for in the market to know if and when you would extend duration.",quarter,Glenn Schorr,Analyst,8,Q and A,Q2_2024,2024-07-12,JPMorgan,transcript,"Glenn Schorr (Analyst)

"But when we look at the Firm's overall sensitivity to rates, we look at it through both, like the EaR-type lens, a short-term NII sensitivity, but also a variety of other lenses, including various types of scenario analysis, including impacts on capital and higher rates.

"Also, given, like the inverted yield curve, it's not as if extending duration from these levels means that you're locking in 5.5% rates. In fact, the forwards are not sort of that compelling given our views about some sort of structural upward pressures on inflation and so on. So, I think when you put that all together, I don't think that kind of a big change in duration posture is a thing that's front of line for us.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,8,Q and A,Q2_2024,2024-07-12,JPMorgan,transcript,"Jeremy Barnum (CFO)

"Good morning. I was just wondering if you can elaborate on essentially the math behind the ROTCE being too high at 20% and more normalized at 17%. Obviously, you've pointed to overearning on NII. And I guess, the question is, is that all of it to go from 20% to 17%? And if so, is that all consumer deposit costs or are there a few other components that you could help frame for us?",quarter,Matt O'Connor,Analyst,9,Q and A,Q2_2024,2024-07-12,JPMorgan,transcript,"Matt O'Connor (Analyst)
JPMorgan, Q2, 2024 Earnings Call Transcript, Page 9"
"Sure. Good question, Matt. I mean, I guess, the way I think about it is a couple of things, like our returns tend to be a bit seasonal, right? So, if you kind of build yourself out a full-year forecast and make reasonable, just based on your own or analyst consensus or whatever and you think about fourth quarter, like better look at this on a full-year basis when you think about the returns than the quarterly numbers and you obviously have to strip out kind of the one-time items.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,9,Q and A,Q2_2024,2024-07-12,JPMorgan,transcript,"Jeremy Barnum (CFO)
JPMorgan, Q2, 2024 Earnings Call Transcript, Page 9"
"And so, if you do that, like whatever you get for this year, is still clearly a number that's higher than the 17%. So, yeah, one source of headwinds is normalization of the NII, primarily as a result of expected higher deposit costs. That's – we've talked about that. Part of it is also the yield curve effects. Some cuts will come into the curve at some point.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,9,Q and A,Q2_2024,2024-07-12,JPMorgan,transcript,"Jeremy Barnum (CFO)
JPMorgan, Q2, 2024 Earnings Call Transcript, Page 9"
"And in the normal course, if you kind of do a very, very, very simple mental model of the company, you would have, like revenues growing at some organic GDP, like rate maybe higher, and expenses growing at a similar slightly lower rate producing a sort of relatively stable overhead ratio. But even if the amount of NII normalization winds up being less than we might have thought at some prior point, you still have some background – you still have some normalization of the overhead ratio that needs to happen.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,9,Q and A,Q2_2024,2024-07-12,JPMorgan,transcript,"Jeremy Barnum (CFO)

"So, as much as our discipline on expense management is as tight as it always has been there, inflation is still non-zero. There are still investments that we're executing. There's still higher expense to come in a slightly flatter revenue environment as a result of, in part, the normalization of NII.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,9,Q and A,Q2_2024,2024-07-12,JPMorgan,transcript,"Jeremy Barnum (CFO)

"And then, the final point is that whatever winds up being the answer on Basel III Endgame and all the other pieces, you have to assume some amount of expansion of the denominator, at least based on what we know so far.

"Yeah, that was a really helpful chart. Just the one follow-up, on the yield curve effects, I guess, what do you mean by that because right now the yield curve is inverted, maybe you're still breathing in the impact of that.

"But I think we saw when rates were at zero and the 10-year note was below 2%, everyone sort of – many people were kind of tempted to try to get extra NIM, extra NII by extending duration a lot.

"Jeremy, I know you touched on deposits earlier in the call in response to a question. I noticed on the average balances the non-interest-bearing deposits were relatively stable quarter-to-quarter versus prior quarters when they’ve steadily declined. And this is one of the areas, of course, investors are focused on in terms of the future of the net interest margin for you and your peers. Can you elaborate, if you can, what you’re seeing in that non-interest-bearing deposit account? I know this is average and not period, and the end number may actually be lower. But what are you guys seeing here?",quarter,Gerard Cassidy,Analyst,12,Q and A,Q2_2024,2024-07-12,JPMorgan,transcript,"Gerard Cassidy (Analyst)

"But I think the more important question is the big picture question, which is what do we expect? How are we thinking about ongoing migration of non-interest-bearing into interest-bearing in the current environment and how that affects our NII outlook and our expectation for weighted average rate paid on deposits?",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,12,Q and A,Q2_2024,2024-07-12,JPMorgan,transcript,"Jeremy Barnum (CFO)
JPMorgan, Q2, 2024 Earnings Call Transcript, Page 12"
"And the answer to that question is that, we do continue to expect that migration to happen. So, if you think about it, in the Wholesale space, you have a bunch of clients with some balances and non-interest-bearing accounts, and over time for a variety of reasons, we do see them moving those balances into interest-bearing.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,12,Q and A,Q2_2024,2024-07-12,JPMorgan,transcript,"Jeremy Barnum (CFO)
JPMorgan, Q2, 2024 Earnings Call Transcript, Page 12"
"So, we do continue to expect that migration to happen and therefore, that will be a source of headwinds. And that migration sometimes happens internally, i.e., out of non-interest-bearing into interest-bearing or into CDs. Sometimes, it goes into money markets or into investments, which is what we see happening in our Wealth Management business and some of it does leave the company.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,12,Q and A,Q2_2024,2024-07-12,JPMorgan,transcript,"Jeremy Barnum (CFO)
JPMorgan, Q2, 2024 Earnings Call Transcript, Page 12"
"But one of the things that we're encouraged by is the extent to which we are actually capturing a large portion of that yield-seeking flow through CDs and money market offerings, et cetera, across our various franchises.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,12,Q and A,Q2_2024,2024-07-12,JPMorgan,transcript,"Jeremy Barnum (CFO)
JPMorgan, Q2, 2024 Earnings Call Transcript, Page 12"
"So, big picture. I do think that migration out of non-interest-bearing into interest-bearing will continue to be a thing and that is a contributor to the modest headwinds that we expect for NII right now. But, yeah, I'll leave it at that, I guess.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,13,Q and A,Q2_2024,2024-07-12,JPMorgan,transcript,"Jeremy Barnum (CFO)

"Very good. And as a follow-up, you've been very clear about the Consumer Credit Card charge-offs and delinquency levels, and we all know about the Commercial Real Estate Office. And you always talk about overearning on net interest income, of course. One of the great credit quality stories for everyone, including yourselves, is the C&I portfolio, how strong it's been in this elevated rate environment?",quarter,Gerard Cassidy,Analyst,13,Q and A,Q2_2024,2024-07-12,JPMorgan,transcript,"Gerard Cassidy (Analyst)

JPMorgan, Q2, 2024 Earnings Call Transcript, Page 13"
"Yeah. It's a good question. I think the short answer is no. We're not really seeing early signs of cracks in C&I. I mean, yes, I agree with you, like the C&I charge-off rate has been very, very low for a long time. I think we emphasized that at last year's Investor Day, if I remember correctly. I think the C&I charge-off rate we've seen in 10 years was something like literally zero.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,13,Q and A,Q2_2024,2024-07-12,JPMorgan,transcript,"Jeremy Barnum (CFO)
JPMorgan, Q2, 2024 Earnings Call Transcript, Page 13"
"So, that is clearly very low by historical standards. And while we take a lot of pride in that number and I think it reflects the discipline in our underwriting process and the strength of our credit culture across the bankers and the risk team, that's not – we don't actually run that franchise to like a zero loss expectation.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,13,Q and A,Q2_2024,2024-07-12,JPMorgan,transcript,"Jeremy Barnum (CFO)
JPMorgan, Q2, 2024 Earnings Call Transcript, Page 13"
"So, you have to assume there will be some upward pressure on that. But in any given quarter, the C&I numbers tend to be quite lumpy and quite idiosyncratic. So, I don't think that anything in the current quarter's results is indicative of anything broader, and I haven't heard anyone internally talk that way, I would say.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,13,Q and A,Q2_2024,2024-07-12,JPMorgan,transcript,"Jeremy Barnum (CFO)

"Hi, good morning. I just had one clean-up question, Jeremy. The consensus provision for 2024 is $10.7 billion. Could you maybe clarify for once and for all sort of Jamie's comments at an industry conference earlier and try to sort of triangulate if that $10.7 billion provision is appropriate for the growth level that you are planning for in Card?",quarter,Erika Najarian,Analyst,13,Q and A,Q2_2024,2024-07-12,JPMorgan,transcript,"Erika Najarian (Analyst)
JPMorgan, Q2, 2024 Earnings Call Transcript, Page 13"
"Yeah. Happy to clarify that. So, Jamie's comments were that the allowance – the build and the Card allowance, so we're talking about Card specifically, we expected something like $2 billion for the full year.

"And I think in terms of what that means for the consensus on the overall allowance change for the year, last time I checked, it still looked a little low on that front.

JPMorgan, Q2, 2024 Earnings Call Transcript, Page 13"
"One question that we've gotten is how to reconcile that build to the 12% growth in OS that we've talked about because it seems like a little bit high relative to what you would have otherwise assumed if you apply some sort of a standard coverage ratio to that growth. But the reason that's the case is essentially a combination of higher revolving mix, as we continue to see some normalization revolve in that 12%, as well as seasoning of earlier vintages, which comes with slightly higher allowance per unit of OS growth.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,14,Q and A,Q2_2024,2024-07-12,JPMorgan,transcript,"Jeremy Barnum (CFO)

"Oh, hey, good morning. Maybe just one last question on sort of deploying excess capital. It seems like the two primary ways to do that organically would be through the trading book or the loan book.

"Thanks, Jim. Good questions. So, yeah, trading assets have been up.

"Our Card business is, of course, in no way capital constrained. So, whatever growth makes sense there in terms of our customer franchise and our ability to acquire accounts and retain accounts and what fits inside our credit risk appetite, is growth that's going to make sense.

"And, of course, for the rest of the loan space, the last thing that we're going to do is have the excess capital, meaning that we lean into lending that is not inside our risk appetite or inside our credit box, especially in a world where spreads are quite compressed and terms are under pressure.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,14,Q and A,Q2_2024,2024-07-12,JPMorgan,transcript,"Jeremy Barnum (CFO)

"So, there's always a balance between capital deployment and assessing economic risk rationally and frankly, that is, in some sense, a microcosm of the larger challenge that we have right now.

"No, but in all seriousness, I think our U.S. economists had their central case outlook to include a very mild recession with I think two quarters of negative half a percent of GDP growth in the fourth quarter and first quarter of this year, and that then got revised out early this quarter to now have sort of modest growth I think around 1% for a few quarters into 2024.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,7,Q and A,Q3_2023,2023-10-13,JPMorgan,transcript,"Jeremy Barnum (CFO)

"Jeremy, you guys have put up a really strong ROTCE number of 22% for the quarter. And when you dive into your different segments, what really jumps out at us is the 40% ex-First Republic ROE in Consumer & Community Banking. I know you and Jamie have talked about your over-earning on credit. We get that. But in view of all of these fintechs and all of these other nonbank competitors that we're all supposed to pick away at everybody's market share, you guys have put up great numbers here. What's the drivers behind an ROE? Even when you take that credit over-earning out, what's driving this business' profitability at such high levels?",quarter,Gerard Cassidy,Analyst,10,Q and A,Q3_2023,2023-10-13,JPMorgan,transcript,"Gerard Cassidy (Analyst)

"So when we talk about over-earning on NII, a disproportionate amount of that is coming out of the Consumer franchise for all of the reasons that we've talked about. But, I would also point out sometimes we don't like the word over-earning because right now, customers are happy and they're doing CDs.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,10,Q and A,Q3_2023,2023-10-13,JPMorgan,transcript,"Jeremy Barnum (CFO)

"Very good. And then as a follow up, which ties into your answer on the deposit margin and consumer and your earlier comments you and Jamie about the internal debate inside JPMorgan about the migration of rates going higher on the funding side. Your non-interest-bearing deposits I think are around 28% of total deposits which is slightly above the 26% you guys had back in 2018 or 2019 or pre-pandemic. Is this expectation that you're going to see more of the non-interest-bearing deposits go into interest-bearing? Or, is it just the repricing of interest-bearing deposits that have some of your folks inside JPMorgan a little more cautious on that net interest income number?",quarter,Gerard Cassidy,Analyst,11,Q and A,Q3_2023,2023-10-13,JPMorgan,transcript,"Gerard Cassidy (Analyst)

"Yeah. It's a good question, Gerard. I think it's a little bit bigger picture than that. And I'm not sure – I get your questions, a good question, but I'm not sure that the reported interest-bearing, non-interest-bearing split is the best lens to look at this through for a couple of reasons.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,11,Q and A,Q3_2023,2023-10-13,JPMorgan,transcript,"Jeremy Barnum (CFO)

JPMorgan, Q3, 2023 Earnings Call Transcript, Page 11"
"So I would tend to zoom out a little bit and see this as a holistic answer, that's driven by internal migration from checking, savings to CDs, from ECR to interest-bearing and Wholesale and then our potential response to the rate environment, the competitive environment, the overall level of system-wide deposits in terms of product level reprice that may or may not happen in moments in the future.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,11,Q and A,Q3_2023,2023-10-13,JPMorgan,transcript,"Jeremy Barnum (CFO)

"Hi. Good morning. Jeremy, my first question is for you, again sort of maybe re-asking the question in a different way. Your new guide for net interest income for this year would imply an exit run rate of $22.9 billion in the fourth quarter. As we think about the dynamics in higher-for-longer, on one hand, your fixed rate assets will continue to reprice. On the other, you even asked a lot about the deposit dynamics that could continue to creep higher. How do we think about those puts and takes as we think about that relative to that exit rate of $22.9 billion in the fourth quarter?",quarter,Erika Najarian,Analyst,11,Q and A,Q3_2023,2023-10-13,JPMorgan,transcript,"Erika Najarian (Analyst)

"Underneath that, I think one thing that's interesting actually, is that as the percentage of the deposits which are CDs increases, the sort of balance between internal migration and betas and rate and volume, it's a little bit less binary and a little bit smoother, so when we look at this type of stuff and we model migration, balances, product level reprice, as you get out of that lower zero bound with 0% CD mix world, things get a little bit smoother, I would say, overall.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,12,Q and A,Q3_2023,2023-10-13,JPMorgan,transcript,"Jeremy Barnum (CFO)

"So it'll be interesting to watch that, but it's obviously one of the most important things for us as a company right now and we do everything we can to manage it, but it's also worth remembering that the big picture point is just the client franchise and as we've often said, we're very focused on primary bank relationships and we didn't lose any of those in the last cycle, and we're not planning to lose any in this cycle, and that's what sort of a long-term focus means for us.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,12,Q and A,Q3_2023,2023-10-13,JPMorgan,transcript,"Jeremy Barnum (CFO)

"Thank you. And my second question is on maybe zooming out on the Basel III Endgame impacts. It's clearly complex, overly complex, and I completely agree with you that it is unnecessary at this point and very backward looking.

"I hear you loud and clear in terms of how this could have harm in terms of pricing for Main Street and dislocating the pipes in American capital markets. But for JPMorgan, does this change your natural return profile of 17%? Jamie, I know you lingered a little bit on 14% when you were at Barclays in September. But at the end of the day, it feels like for the portfolio managers that own JPMorgan through the cycle, does Basel III Endgame really harm your natural earnings power and returns?",quarter,Erika Najarian,Analyst,12,Q and A,Q3_2023,2023-10-13,JPMorgan,transcript,"Erika Najarian (Analyst)

"Yeah. Okay. That's a good question, Erika. I think there's a couple pieces in there, so let me take the most important piece first, which is the 17% through the cycle target.

"So, short answer is we're not going to change that number today, but when you look at what we've disclosed about a 25% increase in capital, you have to start by acknowledging that that is a major headwind to returns.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,12,Q and A,Q3_2023,2023-10-13,JPMorgan,transcript,"Jeremy Barnum (CFO)

"In simple terms, you talk about earnings power and returns, but they're two different things, right. We have to be a little bit pedantic and do numerator and denominator here.

"Two is, once the rule is final, we will seek to reprice in the places where we can. And that'll be different in Consumer and Wholesale, some of it will be product level, some of it will be relationship level, but that hopefully can mitigate some of it but of course the flip side of that is that's cost getting passed into the real economy and that's part of the point that we've made about lowering availability of products and services and lending.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,13,Q and A,Q3_2023,2023-10-13,JPMorgan,transcript,"Jeremy Barnum (CFO)

"And then finally, yeah, we may stop doing certain things and we may exit things. But, I wouldn't necessarily assume that that's going to do a lot to preserve returns at the 17%.

"So that's that, and then the other part of your question implicitly was talking about organic capital generation and I think it's just very important to separate impacts on the economy and impacts on long-term returns from our ability to meet the requirements.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,13,Q and A,Q3_2023,2023-10-13,JPMorgan,transcript,"Jeremy Barnum (CFO)

"Yeah. And I think that last point of Jamie's is particularly important because, sure, if you want, you can construct what I would consider a very optimistic argument that the higher cost of doing business will lead smaller scale players to exit and that's a share gain opportunity for us, but if I refer back to the comments about the disincentives to beneficial diversification and scale, getting bigger, especially in markets is quite expensive from, for example, a GSIB perspective, and so you wind up kind of hemmed in on all sides which is one of the reasons why we're sort of highlighting, but it does seem like the only way out, sometimes, when you look at the cumulative effect of everything that's happened in markets over the last 15 years, is a fundamentally very different system, and while obviously...",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,17,Q and A,Q3_2023,2023-10-13,JPMorgan,transcript,"Jeremy Barnum (CFO)

"Hi, good morning. You talked about increased investment spend in some areas in response to an earlier question. But just how do you think about cost control overall, looking at the medium term? The outlook for revenue is obviously pressured at least on net interest income. Fees might help, but the backdrop is for potentially declining revenue or at least flattish revenue for a couple or few years. So, I know you always say you want to invest for the cycle, and it's really paid off over time, but how are you thinking about cost control the next few years?",quarter,Matt O'Connor,Analyst,17,Q and A,Q3_2023,2023-10-13,JPMorgan,transcript,"Matt O'Connor (Analyst)

"In a world where rates drop very suddenly and recover like quite dramatically, and credit becomes abnormally good and then rebounds, and you've seen these very significant fluctuations in capital markets.

And the goal is to make sure that those other things are sized appropriately to what we believe sustainable through the cycle returns are. So we're always very focused on cost. You can be rest assured of that. That discipline internally is as aggressive as ever as we go through the budget cycle. But there are long-term plays and you really shouldn’t expect us to see trying to generate cosmetically lower costs in response to a lower revenue environment where we didn’t balloon the costs when the revenue became as we’ve argued unsustainably high.,quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,17,Q and A,Q3_2023,2023-10-13,JPMorgan,transcript,"Jeremy Barnum (CFO)

"Yeah. Sure, Jim. I'll try to answer both questions together to the best of my ability. So, as we sit here today, the biggest single driver of the sequential decline is, in fact – that we're expecting – is, in fact, the yield curve. So, that yield curve has changed a little bit since Daniel made his comments at the conference earlier in the quarter, but not that significantly.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,4,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-11,JPMorgan,transcript,"Jeremy Barnum (CFO)

"When you look at yield-seeking behavior that has come down quite a bit, so that's no longer as much of a headwind all else being equal.

"So, maybe, I'll – well, I guess then you also asked me a little bit about next year. So, I guess one thing to say, right, is that we did have a sequential increase in NII this quarter and, as you may recall, at Investor Day, I said that there was some chance that we would see sequential increases followed by sequential declines and that people should avoid kind of drawing the conclusion that we'd hit the trough when that happens.

"And while we're at it, I would also just remind you on the NII comments at the time, the consensus for this year was $91.5 billion and for next year it was $90 billion so that was implying at the time a sequential decline of $1.5 billion.

"To expenses. Yeah. So if you start for the sake of argument with a base of $90 billion, obviously, inflation is normalizing and obviously we're always trying to generate efficiencies to offset inflation.

"The other thing is that we have continued to execute on our growth strategies this year so there's a not insignificant amount of annualization.

"The other thing that's worth noting is that we do expect fees and volume-related businesses to grow next year. And so all else being equal, that would come with a higher expense loading.

"Point two, the curve remains inverted.

"Yeah. Now so when we think of the question of extending duration and really managing duration right now, a couple things to say. So, obviously, a lot of different versions of duration, but one number that we disclose is the EaR. When the 10-Q comes out, you'll see that that number is a little bit lower. It'll come down from $2.8 billion to about $2.1 billion if our current estimates are correct.

"And in the end, the choice to manage and extend duration is really about balancing the volatility of NII against protecting the company from extreme scenarios on either side.

You've got a fourth quarter run rate, you've got some sequential declines, you've got a trough in the middle of the year, and you've got a rough ballpark for the full year.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,7,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-11,JPMorgan,transcript,"Jeremy Barnum (CFO)

"So you can imagine that the trough probably is a little lower than those numbers and then to the extent that growth revolve resumes in the back half of the year in both deposit balances and the ongoing tailwind of Card revolve, although that tailwind will be a little bit less than you might have otherwise thought. I mean, sorry. A little bit less than it was this year but still a tailwind.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,7,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-11,JPMorgan,transcript,"Jeremy Barnum (CFO)

"Obviously, the mix of those things will play out in different ways, and as you point out, who knows what the yield curve will wind up doing.

"Can I just also point out that NII, all things being equal, is a number, but all things are never equal. And the yield curve, if you have a recession the effect of the yield curve will be very different than if you have continued growth. And there are decisions that are made nonstop by us and the things that happen in the marketplace, and I think we spend too much time on just this irrelevancy so you get a model, a number in your model. And so it's going to be less than $87 billion next year. Probably not a lot, we don't know, and we don't know the environment.",quarter,Jamie Dimon,CEO,7,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-11,JPMorgan,transcript,"Jamie Dimon (CEO)

"Good. Okay. Now to your question about the EaR. So, a few things to say in there. So, as I already mentioned, when that comes out, it'll show a number around $2.1 billion. A very important thing to say is, as you know, the experience of this rate cycle has been that our empirical EaR is meaningfully higher than our modeled EaR, which is what we disclose. And the main reason for that is that retail deposit betas have, in actuality, been lower than the modeled deposit betas.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,7,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-11,JPMorgan,transcript,"Jeremy Barnum (CFO)
JPMorgan, Q3, 2024 Earnings Call Transcript, Page 7"
"So as a starting point, you have to kind of adjust that EaR number to be bigger than the reported number for those and a few other reasons, actually, there's some nuances around how the dollar, non-dollar sensitivity interact. And then there's your question which is a little bit about the front-end versus the back-end.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,7,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-11,JPMorgan,transcript,"Jeremy Barnum (CFO)
JPMorgan, Q3, 2024 Earnings Call Transcript, Page 7"
"So, what you see is that actually the front-end EaR has gotten smaller and most of the EaR is now in the back-end. So, it's definitely the case that, all else being equal, a steeper curve is better for us. But I think what I would also say is that this kind of empirical versus theoretical adjustment is disproportionately in the front-end. So therefore, in order to answer your question, I would say, yes, we want a steeper curve, but having the Fed cut more than what's currently in the yield curve is definitely at the margin, for the context of next year's numbers a headwind – would be a headwind for us, we remain asset sensitive to Fed cuts.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,7,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-11,JPMorgan,transcript,"Jeremy Barnum (CFO)

"If you open branches, you initially experience an expense, but down the road you need capital to support the deposits. Same for the Innovation Economy, same for private bankers, et cetera. If you look at it roughly, we have about a minimum $30 billion of excess capital. And for me, it's not burning a hole in my pocket. I look at it as you own the whole company and you can't properly deploy it now, it is perfectly reasonable to wait. And I've been quite clear that I think the future could be quite turbulent. And asset prices, in my view, in life you've got to take a view sometimes, are inflated.

The most important thing we do is serve our clients well, build the technology and do things like that. And we also don’t know what the real excess capital is yet. So, we're a little patient.

"And so first and foremost – I’m going to talk about very strategic and then very tactical, I think they're both important. First and foremost, we are here to give our clients an agnostic view of the world and what the best product and services are for them. Therefore, when a client comes in, we will offer them both direct lending, ourselves, and syndicated lending or other specialized kind of lending.

"Direct lending could be done faster, maybe simpler covenants, unitranche. It is more expensive and you're just seeing a little things go back and forth between syndicated lending and direct lending.

"We mentioned before in the past that we allocated $10 billion of capital to make direct loans. We've actually deployed a lot of capital. Some of those have already been paid off, some of it’s done. So we are going to do it directly and we are going to – $10 billion could be $20 billion or $30 billion, not limiting it today. I will say today, we're extending. We will do $500 million, we will do $1 billion, we will do more than $1 billion, we'll do it sole-handed or we'll do it with partners.",quarter,Jamie Dimon,CEO,9,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-11,JPMorgan,transcript,"Jamie Dimon (CEO)

"Very importantly, we are not going to allocate ourselves to one partner. So we have – I think we've announced a bunch of co-lenders, but that just creates more flexibility and more size. We're not going to use that flexibility to slow it down and have to get permission from everybody, because like I said, JPMorgan could underwrite it and own it like a bridge loan and syndicate it after the fact. And we're going to use our own risk measures and stuff like that, again, all in the service of the client and making sure we're offering them the best thing.",quarter,Jamie Dimon,CEO,9,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-11,JPMorgan,transcript,"Jamie Dimon (CEO)

"And we're going with different strategies. We're not going to tie ourselves exclusively to one capital provider. I think that would limit what we could offer our clients, it probably would be more price competitive. We could do some of this very specific thing and not the solution that this is the third-party capital provider. That's our strategy. We're going to be there, we're going to do it, and we're going to do it in spite of the fact there's capital arbitrage taking place.",quarter,Jamie Dimon,CEO,9,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-11,JPMorgan,transcript,"Jamie Dimon (CEO)

"So if you look at the arbitrage today, where a bank has to hold for things, where insurance could, they are dramatically different. That's a disadvantage, but we've had those disadvantages in other businesses for a long time. We are going to do what's right for the client. Remember, when we do business with a client, we also get other revenues off of them. So it isn't just the loan; we look at the whole relationship. So we're quite comfortable we can compete.

"I note that you talk about requirements coming down relative to what was originally proposed which was obviously true per the speech, but I do think we need to be a little bit careful not to fall into the trap of saying that that's like progress just because the original proposal was so dramatically higher than what anyone thought was reasonable. And I would remind you, which you obviously know, that before this proposal came out, it was our position strongly felt, that our then-prevailing capital requirements were, if anything, already more than we needed.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,10,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-11,JPMorgan,transcript,"Jeremy Barnum (CFO)

"Very good. And then as a follow-up, in view of this excess capital and your comments a moment ago about direct lending, you look at your current cash and marketable securities on a risk-weighted asset basis, you put it in your presentation of course, $1.5 trillion. Average loans is $1.3 trillion. When the dust settles, you know what your capital requirements are. Can you frame out for us, levering up the excess capital with more loans, is that a path that might be considered over the next two or three years relative to where you are on a mix basis?

"And I do think, Gerard, it depends a lot on what type of loans you're talking about, right? So I think in the end, as Jamie says, like it's capital. We're going to deploy it ideally to grow the franchise organically, and that could include loans that are almost good loans on a stand-alone basis, as well as loans that are part of an overall relationship, what we're getting other revenue as part of that. So it's the same strategy that we've always had, but I wouldn't think of it as like excess capital to be deployed against a particular product. I would think of it as it's there for a rainy day. Let's hope the environment doesn't deteriorate a lot, but if it does, we'll be ready. And there will be opportunities hopefully to deploy it against a client franchise or against a stock.

"I would say, Matt, generally no, frankly, with a couple of minor exceptions. So I think it's probably fair to say that the outperformance late in the quarter in investment banking fees was to a meaningful degree, as I mentioned, driven by DCM as well as to some degree driven by the acceleration of the closing of some M&A transactions. And I do think that some of that DCM outperformance is in the sort of types of deals that are opportunistic deals that aren't in our pipeline, and those are often driven by treasurers and CFOs sort of seeing improvement in market levels and jumping on those.

"So I think what there is to say about consumer spend is a little bit boring in a sense because what's happened is that it's become normal, so meaning – I mean, I think we're getting to the point where it no longer makes sense to talk about the pandemic, but maybe one last time. One of the things that you had was that heavy rotation into T&E as people did a lot of traveling and they booked cruises that they hadn't done before, and everyone was going out to dinner a lot, whatever. So you had the big spike in T&E, the big rotation into discretionary spending, and that's now normalized. And you would normally think that rotation out of discretionary into nondiscretionary would be a sign of consumers battening down the hatches and getting ready for a much worse environment. But given the levels that it started from, what we see it as is actually like normalization.

"Let me take the flip side of that question for those of you who are worried about you leaving. The other side of the question is we were on these calls the last couple of years. You're saying the stock is over-valued, and I think that's what you're saying. You're saying the stock market is over-valued and therefore all stocks are over-valued. And on the one hand, you guys, you highlight on this call AI, tech, market share gains, high returns, high capital. So, do you think in some ways when we think about the value of your price, and your ability to do buybacks, you're thinking more about an old school model for valuing your stock as opposed to a new school model that might put you in the category of more tech-oriented firms, especially as it relates to your progress with AI.",quarter,Mike Mayo,Analyst,12,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-11,JPMorgan,transcript,"Mike Mayo (Analyst)

We haven't lost the money. It didn't go away. It's sitting in store. The only time that would be really wrong is if the stock runs way up, we've got to buy at much higher prices.

"Yeah, good morning. I guess just wanted to follow-up. You talked about private credit and the disruption to bank lending. Another area I would appreciate if you can address is we've been hearing a lot about the likes of Jane Street and other market makers potentially disrupting fixed income trading. Is that a real risk? And is there an opportunity for a firm like JPMorgan to actually compete on the private venue side on market making beyond traditional sort of FICC activity?",quarter,Ebrahim H.

"Yeah, Ebrahim, the way I would frame that is not as a risk but as a reality. We've always emphasized in all of our businesses that we operate in an extremely competitive environment, and that applies to – and that competitive environment isn't limited to competing against banks or traditional financial institutions. It extends in the consumer space to fintechs. And in the market making space, it obviously increasingly is extending to some of the types of firms that you're referring to.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,13,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-11,JPMorgan,transcript,"Jeremy Barnum (CFO)

"Now those firms are, in many cases, also clients. And that's the same type of dynamic that you see, for example, in the private credit space that we've discussed before. So there's no question that the ecosystem is changing. You've got new competitors. You've got changes in market structure, new dynamics.

"Of course, there are some ways in which being a bank hinders our ability to do that. And one of the arguments that we've made going back to the capital and liquidity regulations is that when you come to the impact on the kind of U.S. capital markets ecosystem, which is the end view of the world, its worked well in its current construct for a long time where some activities were inside the regulated perimeter and there was robust participation from unregulated capital of various sorts. And a world where more and more of that activity gets pushed outside of bank market makers is a meaningful change to that structure that is untested, and it's unclear why you would want that. And we've cautioned that if that's the intent of the regulations, it should be intentional and well-studied. But in the meantime, we're going to adjust and compete to the best of our ability given the constraints of the current rule set.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,13,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-11,JPMorgan,transcript,"Jeremy Barnum (CFO)

"The previous answer on the private markets, it remains to be seen how that develops. There is a little bit of that, and some people are talking about making more active things in private markets. In some ways we're well-positioned for that too, because for that you need liquidity, market-making valuation, buyers and sellers on both sides to create liquidity. So that hasn't developed yet, but we may have competition, but we'll be there when the time comes.",quarter,Jamie Dimon,CEO,13,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-11,JPMorgan,transcript,"Jamie Dimon (CEO)

"And the second one is the public markets. You have seen reports about you have deal inventories, both corporate and treasuries. And I do think that's capital. But again, we do it, remember, for clients. So we are large market makers on both sides of the markets for clients in both credit and treasuries, which is a little different than some of the other people just trading for their own account. And so they are both competition from our standpoint, but we're there. We're going to do it. We're can always deploy more capital if we want. And we would even deploy more capital at lower returns if we really had to do that to service clients. So we're very conscious of it. There will be competition both sides.

"Yeah. It's a good question, Ebrahim. But I think you've kind of answered your own question. In other words, like the argument out there is that the repo spike that we saw at the end of this quarter was an indication that maybe the market is approaching that lowest comfortable level of reserves that's been heavily speculated about. And recognizing that that number is probably higher and driven by the evolution of firm's liquidity requirements as opposed to some of the more traditional measures.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,14,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-11,JPMorgan,transcript,"Jeremy Barnum (CFO)

"And side point, it's just another reason why it's important to look at the whole framework holistically when we think about the regulatory response of the events of two springs ago. You don't want those types of spikes and it raises some questions about why there isn't more readiness to deploy into those types of disruptions, albeit this one was relatively minor.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,14,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-11,JPMorgan,transcript,"Jeremy Barnum (CFO)

"But in any case, when you put all that together, it would seem to add some weight to the notion that maybe QT should be wound down and that seems to be increasingly the consensus that that's going to get announced at some point in the fourth quarter. So my only point was if you play that view through, it's a residual headwind for system-wide deposit growth which gets removed. And that's one of the reasons that we feel that we're probably in the trough of our deposit balances at the level of...",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,14,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-11,JPMorgan,transcript,"Jeremy Barnum (CFO)

"So I just want to add a couple policy things here. I'm not actually sure they can actually do that, because you have inflationary factors out there, partially driven by QE. And also, look at the volatility. It's not a risk to JPMorgan. It's a risk to the system. And what banks have, I already mentioned the constrained balance sheet a little bit. So the banks will have trillions of dollars of cash and unable to deploy the repo markets. And is it a good policy thing that every time that happens, because you can do it very safely, fully collateralized, all things like that, providing what I call flexible financing in the marketplace, that that happens, the Fed has to step in every time? I think that becomes a policy issue that every time there's some kind of fluctuation in the market, people panic and the Fed has got to step in and provide stuff. And can they always do that if you have a slightly more inflationary environment going forward?",quarter,Jamie Dimon,CEO,14,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-11,JPMorgan,transcript,"Jamie Dimon (CEO)

While we're on NII, just to annoy Jamie a little bit more, I do want to make a point that I didn't get a chance to make previously, which is there's a reason that we emphasize the implied fourth quarter run rate for the Markets NII in the presentation which is that if you take that and you annualize it, it gives you a launch point run rate, which is significantly higher than what's currently in the consensus and obviously what we've seen this year. And I'll give you the concise version of my usual speech that changes in Markets NII are almost always bottom-line neutral and offset in NIR. But for the purposes of trying to help you guys with your models, I would just encourage you to recognize what that launch point is, the number of cuts that are in the curve, the fact that that number has historically and in the recent past has been quite liability-sensitive, so you can draw your own conclusions about what that should mean.

"Hey. Good morning. I'm not going to ask about a specific NII in 2025, but I did want to delve into the how to think about your deposit margin in volume dynamics in the CCB over the next few years. You have seen a decent amount of pressure in the deposit margin, 2.6%, down about 30 basis points as deposit balances have come down, so it put some pressure on deposit NII. But deposit margins are still well above where they were when rates were at levels that are consistent with where the forward curve now has been going. So I guess how do we think about both volumes and margin dynamics if rates do come down, say, to the level that are consistent with the forward curve?

"Sure. Yeah, thanks for the question, Saul. And I think you've laid out the building blocks there already. Just for simplicity, I'm going to try to answer your question without referring to the disclosed CCB deposit margin number, just because that number is obviously the combination of the rate paid on the CCB deposits and the internal FTP into that. And that is a complicated thing that evolves as a function of the modeling of the betas and other things. So I think it's actually more helpful to look at this simply from a Firmwide perspective and look at the evolution of the rate paid in the context of the policy rates roughly, and just set aside the duration management and all those sort of factors.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,17,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-11,JPMorgan,transcript,"Jeremy Barnum (CFO)

"And I think when you do that, what you see is we've been saying for a while that the deposit margin defined for these purposes is simply the difference between the policy rate and the weighted-average rate paid of the consumer deposits, was unsustainably high. And that was going to have to correct one way or the other. Either deposits were going to reprice at the product level through checking and savings, and/or we were going to see a ton of internal migration, i.e. growth in the CD mix, and/or we would see a lower policy rate. So as we sit here right now, of course, we make pricing decisions in the context of market competition at any given moment looking at what the environment is for deposits, but we have not needed to reprice in order to retain primary bank relationships which was also our core strategy. We were never going to chase sort of the hot money at the margin.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,17,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-11,JPMorgan,transcript,"Jeremy Barnum (CFO)

"We've leaned in heavily to CDs and gotten to the current level of CD mix, and that's been a good strategy. And from where we sit now, we now have the margin coming down as a result of the policy rate coming down. It seems that, that puts us in a pretty comfortable position from a pricing perspective.

"Now, on the way down, it's not going to go back down to zero, where it was at the beginning of the cycle. That's an important thing to realize. So all else equal, that creates a little bit of margin compression. And then through all of that, obviously, a lower yield environment should mean that there's a little bit less outflow from consumer deposits, as I mentioned. We're seeing a lot less yield-seeking behavior. So then when you overlay on to that what you mentioned, which is our long-term share growth in CCB deposits, in no small part as a function of the brand strategy and the buildout and the fact that only about a quarter of our top 125 markets in CCB are at that 15% share number, so we believe there's big opportunity to grow the rest of it and be on track at the type of average annual share growth of the order of 30 basis points or 40 basis points that we've seen historically.

"With that, let's pivot to the outlook for 2024, starting with NII on page 10. We expect 2024 NII ex. Markets to be approximately $88 billion. Going through the drivers, the outlook assumes that rates follow the forward curve, which currently includes six cuts this year. On deposits, we expect balances to be very modestly down from current levels. While lower rates should decrease repricing pressure, we remain asset sensitive, and therefore, lower rates will decrease NII, resulting in more normal deposit margins. We expect strong loan growth in Card to continue, but not at the same pace as 2023. Still, this should help offset some of the impact of lower rates. Outside of Card, loan growth will likely remain muted.",year,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,3,Prepared remarks,Q4_2023,2024-01-12,JPMorgan,transcript,"Jeremy Barnum (CFO)
JPMorgan, Q4, 2023 Earnings Call Transcript, Page 3"
It's important to note that we just reported a quarterly NII ex. Markets run rate of $94 billion. Combining that with the full year guidance of approximately $88 billion implies meaningful sequential quarterly declines throughout 2024 consistent with what we've been telling you for some time. And keep in mind that many of the sources of uncertainty that we've highlighted previously surrounding the NII outlook remain.,both,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,3,Prepared remarks,Q4_2023,2024-01-12,JPMorgan,transcript,"Jeremy Barnum (CFO)

"Now, let's turn to expenses on page 11. We expect 2024 adjusted expense to be about $90 billion. You'll see on the slide, we provided detail by line of business.

"On the right-hand side of the page, we've highlighted some Firmwide drivers. Thematically, the biggest driver is what I might call business growth writ large. Within that, narrowly defined volume and revenue-related growth represents about $1 billion of the increase across the company as a result of an improved NIR outlook compared to about $400 million in 2023. But in addition, the ongoing growth of the company, which continues to produce share gains and additional profitability, is coming with increased expense across a range of categories.",year,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,4,Prepared remarks,Q4_2023,2024-01-12,JPMorgan,transcript,"Jeremy Barnum (CFO)
JPMorgan, Q4, 2023 Earnings Call Transcript, Page 4"
"The quantum of investment increase is comparable to last year's increase and is driven by all the same themes, bankers, branches, advisors, technology, as well as marketing. Net net, First Republic produces a modest increase in expenses, but with a significantly lower 2024 exit run rate as the result of business integration efforts. Finally, despite significantly lower inflation outlook and the economy as a whole, we still see some residual effects of inflation flowing through most of our expense categories.",year,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,4,Prepared remarks,Q4_2023,2024-01-12,JPMorgan,transcript,"Jeremy Barnum (CFO)

It's worth noting that both the general business growth and investment growth include decisions that have been executed both in response to market conditions during 2023 and to support the future growth and profitability of the company. We've included the fourth quarter 2023 exit rate on the page to illustrate that a significant portion of the year-on-year increase in expense is already in the run rate.,both,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,4,Prepared remarks,Q4_2023,2024-01-12,JPMorgan,transcript,"Jeremy Barnum (CFO)

We're very proud of what we accomplished this year and want to thank everyone who made it possible.

"Yeah. Matt, not particularly updating. I think you're referring to that $80 billion number that we'd put out there, and I wouldn't exactly describe that as an outlook. I think it's more just a number that we put out there to try to quantify a little bit the extent of the over earning. So, not particularly necessary to revise the number. But I just would point out, again, as we highlight on the page, and as I highlighted in the prepared remarks, that when you look at that $94 billion exit rate and full year guidance of $88 billion, that implies obviously exiting below $88 billion and some significant sequential decline. So, in that sense, you can see us kind of marching on the path to that $80 billion.

But for now, we plan to remain on a modest pace of buybacks consistent with that kind of $2 billion net buyback a quarter number that we've talked about and that you've seen us do, in light of the – probably the need to continue building to have a bit of a buffer, as you said, the uncertainty about the finalization of the rules. And also just as a reminder, the SCB is probably a little bit low right now and has been quite volatile.

"Yeah. Actually, John, this quarter, that's all like pretty quiet. So, the weighted average unemployment rate number is still 5.5%. We didn't have any really big revisions in the macro outlook driving the numbers, and our skew remains as it has been – a little bit skewed to the downside. Just recognizing that we still see risks being elevated, which obviously you can see that skew in the difference between the weighted average unemployment of 5.5%, and what's in our central outlook, which I think is something like 4.6% (sic) [4.4%] peak of the current levels.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,5,Q and A,Q4_2023,2024-01-12,JPMorgan,transcript,"Jeremy Barnum (CFO)

Like what's the impact of a few Fed cuts and how much does it matter like for the first two versus if you're thinking four, five, six?

"Sure. Yeah, happy to do that, John. So, I think probably the best way to do this is to look at our EaR numbers. So, as you know, we don't update that until the Q. But on an estimated basis, it's going to be a little bit lower. So, I think something like $1.9 billion as opposed to $2.1 billion. So, just round numbers, about $2 billion in EaR. I think, empirically, the number is maybe a little higher than that just because even though we do model lags in the EaR, we've been seeing the lag effect be a little bit bigger. But just crudely, I think as I noted, we do remain asset-sensitive. That's one way to quantify it. I would say the empirical number would maybe be a little higher than that, and hopefully, that gives you enough to work with.",year,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,5,Q and A,Q4_2023,2024-01-12,JPMorgan,transcript,"Jeremy Barnum (CFO)

"Hey. Good morning. Maybe just to follow up in a different way on the NII question, just in deposits, can you, Jeremy, discuss your assumptions on the reprice and migration thoughts? And then, layering in if we do get six cuts, does that start to change the dynamic around growth in deposits? How are you thinking about all that?",year,Jim Mitchell,Analyst,6,Q and A,Q4_2023,2024-01-12,JPMorgan,transcript,"Jim Mitchell (Analyst)

"Yeah. Both good questions. So let's do reprice first. So, I think all else equal, this more dovish Fed environment and these six cuts has the effect of taking a little bit of pressure off the reprice, especially product-level reprice. At the same time, we do continue to expect internal migration, particularly out of checking and savings into CDs, and in Wholesale, a little bit of ongoing migration out of non-interest-bearing into interest-bearing.",year,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,6,Q and A,Q4_2023,2024-01-12,JPMorgan,transcript,"Jeremy Barnum (CFO)

"And that trajectory, I would expect to continue even in a lower rate environment. So, as a result, if you look at weighted average rate paid, for example, for the consumer deposit franchise, we would actually expect that number to be a little bit higher, just even in a world with six cuts. And that's actually intuitive when you think about it, as people continue migrating into CDs, but maybe a little non-intuitive if you're kind of trying to do beta type math with like change in rates and change in rate paid.

It's a pretty modest decline outlook consistent with the lower rates. So, I kind of agree with you that this environment is at the margin, a little bit more supportive for system-wide deposit balances.

"Yeah. So, good question on the multi-family, and the short answer is that, for us, it's pretty uncontroversially no – no bleed-through. And the reason is that while we are aware of some of the pressure on multi-family, that's in kind of different markets from the ones that we are actually big in. So, it's higher-end stuff in much less supply constrained markets that is under more pressure. And as you know, our multi-family portfolio is much more affordable, supply constrained markets.

On a net basis, net of RWA growth, your net income produces 51 basis points every quarter. Again, that's net of RWA growth. I'm wondering what guideposts you're looking for, Jeremy, in terms of that buyback increasing from that $2 billion a quarter.

Or will having clarity in the June D-FAST results – you mentioned the SCB – sort of be enough that you could reconsider this pace over the medium term?",both,Erika Najarian,Analyst,7,Q and A,Q4_2023,2024-01-12,JPMorgan,transcript,"Erika Najarian (Analyst)

I think the answer is going to be a little bit unsatisfying, which is that this is classic decision-making under uncertainty and it's kind of a probabilistic cloud of a variety of different factors. But, all the ingredients that you've listed are the right ingredients; right, very strong organic capital generation, uncertainty about the finalization of the rule, uncertainty about the SCB requirements, and obviously, our normal capital hierarchy, which is that buybacks are always at the bottom of the hierarchy after we're done using the capital for our other priorities.",both,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,7,Q and A,Q4_2023,2024-01-12,JPMorgan,transcript,"Jeremy Barnum (CFO)

We had an 8% growth in active card accounts. And over the last three years, we've increased deposit market share by 180 basis points.

So, as a result, the biggest driver in the CIB is really generic inflation, including labor as well as, again to the prior question, volume and revenue-related increases tied to the improved NIR outlook. And I do want to say for the avoidance of doubt that despite all of this, our core strategy of looking very granularly at all the areas of strength and weakness and making sure that we're upgrading where appropriate to have absolutely the best talent in the CIB remains fully in effect.",year,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,8,Q and A,Q4_2023,2024-01-12,JPMorgan,transcript,"Jeremy Barnum (CFO)

So, that's happening throughout the company both at the app level and otherwise.

I think that the math is the math in the sense that QT, all else equal, is withdrawing from system-wide deposits.

So – and we still have reasonable levels of reserves and some cushion from RRP. So, that's part of the reason that our outlook is for deposits to be modestly down, with the shrinkage in system-wide deposits maybe partially offset by our belief that we can take some share.

"Hey. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. There has been a lot of talk about capital markets rebound. You noted you're starting the year with a healthy pipeline. Could you give us some more color on what you're seeing there and how the rate in – how the change in the rate environment is changing the conversations that you're having across M&A, ECM and DCM?",year,Manan Gosalia,Analyst,11,Q and A,Q4_2023,2024-01-12,JPMorgan,transcript,"Manan Gosalia (Analyst)
JPMorgan, Q4, 2023 Earnings Call Transcript, Page 11"
"Yeah, sure. So, as you know, all else equal, this more dovish rate environment is of course supportive for capital markets. So, if you go into the details a little bit, if you start with ECM, that helps. Higher and – well, the recent rally in the equity markets helps. I think there've been some modest challenges with the 2023 IPO vintage in terms of post-launch performance or whatever. So, that's a little bit of a headwind at the margin in terms of converting the pipeline, but I'm not too concerned about that in general. So, I would expect to see rebound there.",year,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,11,Q and A,Q4_2023,2024-01-12,JPMorgan,transcript,"Jeremy Barnum (CFO)
JPMorgan, Q4, 2023 Earnings Call Transcript, Page 11"
"In DCM, again, all else equal, lower rates are clearly supportive. One of the nuances there is the distinction between the absolute level of rates and the rate of change, that sometimes you see corporates seeing and expecting lower rates, and therefore, waiting to refinance in the hope of even lower rates. So, that can go both ways. And then, M&A is a slightly different dynamic. I think there's a couple nuances there. One, as you obviously know, announced volume was lower this year. So, that will be a headwind in reported revenues in 2024, all else equal. And of course, we are in an environment of M&A regulatory headwinds, as has been heavily discussed. But having said that, I think we're seeing a bit of pick-up in deal flow, and I would expect the environment to be a bit more supportive.",year,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,11,Q and A,Q4_2023,2024-01-12,JPMorgan,transcript,"Jeremy Barnum (CFO)

"Great. And on the flip side, in C&I, you spoke about lower revolver utilization, more muted demand. What would it take for that to rebound? Do you think it accelerates from here if rates come down or is there room for this to slow even further if the capital markets open up even more?",year,Manan Gosalia,Analyst,11,Q and A,Q4_2023,2024-01-12,JPMorgan,transcript,"Manan Gosalia (Analyst)
JPMorgan, Q4, 2023 Earnings Call Transcript, Page 11"
"Yeah. It's a good question. I mean, I think as you say, it's a little bit of a – I mean, I wouldn't necessarily say that, like, lack of debt market access in the last year, that was more of an earlier effect in terms of having that drive revolver utilization. I think the main driver there is just a little bit of residual anxiety in the C-suite, which increases as the companies get smaller in size.",year,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,11,Q and A,Q4_2023,2024-01-12,JPMorgan,transcript,"Jeremy Barnum (CFO)

"So, it's really going to be a function of how 2024 plays out. The softer the landing is, the more supported the utilization should be, I would think. If things turn out a little bit worse, I think management teams are going to be incrementally more cautious about CapEx and so on, and so you might see utilization even lower.",year,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,11,Q and A,Q4_2023,2024-01-12,JPMorgan,transcript,"Jeremy Barnum (CFO)

"Hi. Thank you. So, I want to get your perspective on private credit overall. The industry saw a lot of growth, but it's only so big relative to the banking market. I think there's been a lot of share shift in direct lending and middle market lending.

"Yeah. Thanks, Glenn. So, I think the last part of your question, as you say, is the most important part, which is this as an important factor in the competitive dynamic and what is one of the key things that we offer as a company.

"We've made some enhancements and some new initiatives to ensure that we can compete effectively both in our traditional syndicated lending businesses, but also go head-to-head with the private credit providers in these types of unitranche structures, if and when that's what the client actually wants. It tends to be a trade-off between the best possible pricing versus speed and certainty of execution, and we can provide both off our sort of exceptionally strong long-time DCM franchise. So, that's been a priority, and we're actually already starting to see some results from that across both the Commercial Bank and the CIB with certain client segments.",both,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,12,Q and A,Q4_2023,2024-01-12,JPMorgan,transcript,"Jeremy Barnum (CFO)

"And in the bigger picture, of course, in the context of the Basel III Endgame, people talk a lot about the risk of certain lending activity getting pushed out of the regulated perimeter. It's important to be clear, right, these are important clients of ours too. We compete with them. They're also clients. And in the end, our point here is just people, and regulators in particular, should just be aware of the likely consequences of what's happening here and make sure that the results are intentional and that we're looking around the corner a little bit.",both,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,12,Q and A,Q4_2023,2024-01-12,JPMorgan,transcript,"Jeremy Barnum (CFO)

"Thank you. I have a question about the role that First Republic plays in your NII forecast. I'm assuming, because you'll have a full year in 2024 of First Republic that their contribution of NII will be up, let's say, from $3.7 billion this year to $5 billion to $6 billion next year. But given that you're forecasting six rate cuts, is that a detractor to your assumptions of NII from First Republic? Or – I mean, you have that FDIC note, and then you also have a significant amount of adjustable rate mortgages that I assume are repricing upwards. So, if you're talking about rate cuts, that would hurt your NII forecast from First Republic, I'm guessing. But if rates stay higher for longer, wouldn't First Republic be a much bigger contributor? So, talk about the sensitivities of First Republic there.",year,Charles W. Peabody,Analyst,12,Q and A,Q4_2023,2024-01-12,JPMorgan,transcript,"Charles W. Peabody (Analyst)

"Yeah. Thanks, Charlie. So, one thing that we said when we kind of gave First Republic guidance at Investor Day earlier this year is that while we understood the need to track that, and we've been splitting out First Republic in our reported results in order to improve period-on-period comparability, we kind of want to stay out of the business of guiding on First Republic.",year,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,12,Q and A,Q4_2023,2024-01-12,JPMorgan,transcript,"Jeremy Barnum (CFO)

"Having said that, let me just react to a couple of the things that you said. So, again, I don't want to get into like micro-validation one way or the other of some of your back-of-the-envelope math. But we did have some accelerated pull to par on some of the accretion of some of the loans that we purchased this year. So, I think the annualization that you're doing is maybe a bit high for the 2024 number. And then, from a sensitivities perspective, I actually think I can simplify the math for you a little bit and just kind of direct you to the EaR per my response to the prior question. Because that EaR fully includes all of the First Republic assets and liabilities with all of the various dynamics. And so, I think that's kind of like an easier way to think about it for the company.",year,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,13,Q and A,Q4_2023,2024-01-12,JPMorgan,transcript,"Jeremy Barnum (CFO)

"Yeah. I mean, I can probably answer that question if I think about it for a second, but it sort of violates my prior statement that I really don't want to get into the business of guiding on First Republic. If I do the big picture, right, so big picture, 2023, we had eight months of First Republic NII. 2024, we're going to have 12. So, all else equal, there's calendarization in there. What's also true is that in 2023, as a result of the impact of the NII of the pull to par of certain relatively short-dated assets that we fair-valued at a meaningful discount as part of the transaction, that sort of – that pull to par happens quite quickly, and therefore, probably juiced the 2023 number a little bit. So, therefore, straight annualization is probably not the right way to think about it. Then, you just get into the questions about the FTP and the funding and whatever, and then this is like too complicated.

Over that whole time, helped me build one of the great investment banks in the world.

"Hi. Good morning. Jeremy, I wanted to ask about capital, and I know you get this question a lot about the kind of high-class dilemma of your growing capital base and your perspective of that as earnings in store.

"So, yeah, you've noted all the points that we always make so I won't repeat them. And I think the way we're thinking about it right now is that we feel very comfortable with the notion that it makes sense for us to have a nice store of extra capital in light of the current environment. We believe there's a good chance that there will be a moment where we get to deploy it at better levels essentially in whatever way than the current opportunities would suggest. And so that feels like a correct kind of strategic and financial decision for us. Having said that, having studied it quite extensively over the last six months and have all the debates that you would expect, we've concluded that we do have enough. We have enough excess. And given that, we would like to not have the excess grow from here.",year,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,5,Q and A,Q4_2024,2025-01-15,JPMorgan,transcript,"Jeremy Barnum (CFO)
JPMorgan, Q4, 2024 Earnings Call Transcript, Page 5"
"So, when you think about the implications of that, given the amount of organic capital generation that we're producing, it means that unless we find in the near term opportunities for organic deployment or otherwise, it means more capital return through buybacks, all else being equal, in order to arrest the growth of the excess. And that is our current plan, although, I'll give the caveat that, as you know, is in our disclosure, which is we don't want to get in the business of guiding on buybacks, and we reserve the right to change the trajectory at any time for any reason, but that is our current thinking.",year,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,5,Q and A,Q4_2024,2025-01-15,JPMorgan,transcript,"Jeremy Barnum (CFO)

"Okay. Thanks, Jeremy. And then just as a follow-up, when we think about the investment spend agenda this year, how does it differ from, say, last year or last couple of years across lines of business in this kind of certainty of return spectrum you've talked about?

"Sure. The truth is – and I guess this is a good thing that the themes are remarkably consistent. So, we are seeing the results of our kind of high certainty investment choices across all the categories that you know very well and that we highlighted on the outlook page for expenses, and those continue to be the main areas of focus. The execution gets tweaked at the margin as we pursue different opportunities in the Commercial & Investment Bank. We continue drilling down and analyzing into the relative pockets of weakness that you might see if you go a level or two below the very significantly strong share positions that you see on an aggregate level. Daniel always talked about the reds and the ambers that are behind the greens, and that's embedded in the culture of the company. So we do that everywhere and continue analyzing and iterating, and we throw resources against that stuff as we do that.

"I think, in terms of efficiency, a couple of things to say, which you know well. One is, when we think about efficiency and how we generate it at this company, it's organic, it's BAU, it's evergreen; it happens every day in all the teams, everywhere.

"We do have a few top-down areas of focus. I think if I go, for example, into technology for starters, we're putting a lot of effort into improving the sort of ability of our software engineers to be productive as they do development, and there's been a lot of focus on that – the development environment for them, in order to enable them to be more productive. And so all else equal, that generates a little bit of efficiency. We also have a lot of focus on the efficiency of our hardware utilization.

"And another thing that's worth noting, you'll recall that, at Investor Day, I talked about how we had probably reached peak modernization spend. As Jamie always says, we're always modernizing. So, the fact that we've gotten to a peak and then it might come down a little bit from here still means we're going to be constantly modernizing. But, at the margin, that means that inside the tech teams, there's a little bit of capacity that gets freed up to focus on features and new product development and so on, which is also in some sense a form of efficiency.",year,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,5,Q and A,Q4_2024,2025-01-15,JPMorgan,transcript,"Jeremy Barnum (CFO)

"Finally, though, what I would say is that if you look at the head count trajectory of the company over the last few years, we have grown a lot and it has been for very good reasons.

JPMorgan, Q4, 2024 Earnings Call Transcript, Page 6"
"But any time you have that quantum of headcount growth as well as that rate of headcount growth, you have to believe, all else equal, that some amount of inefficiency has been introduced. And so, this year, as we went through the budget cycle, we ask people, at the margin, to try to support the growth of the company while living within their means on the headcount front. So we're going to try to run things, with some important exceptions that I'll highlight in a second, on roughly flat head count and have that lead to people generating internal efficiencies as they get creative with their teams, and we consider more efficient ways of doing things. The obvious exceptions are the ongoing areas of high certainty investment and growth, so, obviously, branches and bankers and so on. And also, critical non-negotiable areas of risk and control like cyber or whatever independent risk management needs to ensure that we're running the company safely. So that's how we're thinking about efficiency in the current moment.",year,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,6,Q and A,Q4_2024,2025-01-15,JPMorgan,transcript,"Jeremy Barnum (CFO)

"Hi. Simple and then more difficult, I guess. Jamie, who's your successor? And then the second question is, I know I asked the question at Investor Day, why not stay as CEO a little bit longer? I think what I'm hearing from investors now, it goes up and down, but I think investors would like you to stay. So, why say you're going to stay less than five years? You're finally getting what you wanted, 15 years, your spaghetti chart about the regulatory structure and the unpredictability of capital requirements and regulatory costs, and it seems like you're finally getting what you've been playing for. So, why not stay around a bit longer if investors want you to do so? And what would you do otherwise anyway? You don't play golf. You aren't going to be Treasury Secretary.

If I'm here for several more years, and I may or may not be Chairman. That's going to be up to the Board. Does it really fit the new CEO and stuff like that? You're talking potentially four, five years or more. I'll be 69 in March. I think it's the rational thing to do. I've had a couple health problems, you know.

I think it's wonderful that Jenn Piepszak, who does not want to be the CEO, will be here as Chief Operating Officer and stay after that. So, obviously, she's going to work with those people which I think is great for a company, just having continuity of management and leadership, and will be one of those people. And obviously, we're not going to tell the press, but it's not determined yet.

"Hey, Jim. I mean, it's obviously something we're thinking about a lot. But I could go down some pretty deep rabbit holes speculating on all the different parts of the framework and how they could evolve, and I just don't really think that's productive right now. But let me make some attempt to answer your question. So, backing up a second, if you read Jamie's quotes, they're very consistent with what we've been saying as a company for a long time, which is that all we want is a coherent, rational, holistically-assessed regulatory framework that allows banks to do their job, supporting the economy, that isn't reflexively anti-bank, that doesn't default to the answer to every question being more of",year,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,7,Q and A,Q4_2024,2025-01-15,JPMorgan,transcript,"Jeremy Barnum (CFO)

"And that also, while we're at it, some aspects of the supervisory framework get a little bit less bureaucratic and a little less adversarial and a little bit more substantive so that at the margin, management can focus its time on the things that matter the most. So, whether capital goes up, down, stays flat is really so complicated because it's not just Basel III Endgame, it's also a G-SIB, it's also a number of other factors. And that's why we keep hammering away on the importance of doing all of this holistically, properly with the right analysis.

"Can I just add, no that's great. Jeremy gave it all. Let me add three quick things. Liquidity is also equally important. There's been a lot of recognition that what counts as liquidity and discount windows and how LCR is done I think is very important. Second is competition. All these things should be done in light of looking at what kind of public markets you want, what kind of private markets you want, what do you want in the banking system, what you want out of the banking system. And the third is I think most people realize there is a huge need to take a step back and look at the Byzantine, Balkanized system we built which has negatives, and even the regulators will tell you that.

"Yeah, it's a good question. And I think given the significant improvement in business sentiment and the general optimism out there, you might have expected to see some pickup in loan growth. We are not really seeing that. I don't particularly think that's a negative. I think it's probably explained by a combination of wide-open capital markets, and so many of the larger corporates accessing the capital markets and healthy balance sheets in small businesses and maybe some residual caution. And maybe there are some pockets and some industries where some aspects of the policy uncertainty that we might be facing are making them a little bit more cautious than they otherwise would be about what they're executing in the near-term.

So, if we look at the third quarter regulatory data for your G-SIB surcharge score, that would imply that your score would put you in a range of a 5% G-SIB. So, obviously, from what we understand, if you print that – somewhere near that score at the end of this year, then your G-SIB surcharge goes up by – to 5% or by 50 basis points two years and one day from now. At the same time, around the holidays, we did get the press release from both the Federal Reserve and the lawsuit from the banks. In terms of the transparency, it looks like the transparency is going to be focused on perhaps being improved as soon as this year's stress test.",both,Erika Najarian,Analyst,9,Q and A,Q4_2024,2025-01-15,JPMorgan,transcript,"Erika Najarian (Analyst)

"So, as we think about the definition of excess, right, because part of this is like 15.7% is clearly a huge number. So, as we think about your returns going forward, the definition of excess also continues to shift. So, how should we think about those crosscurrents in terms of two big components, clearly, one is your G-SIB surcharge and the other is your stress capital buffer?",year,Erika Najarian,Analyst,9,Q and A,Q4_2024,2025-01-15,JPMorgan,transcript,"Erika Najarian (Analyst)

"Right, Erika. Okay. You are tempting me with many rabbit holes that are very deep. But let's try and address this not too much great length. First of all, G-SIB. So, yes, it was a high print in the third quarter, but we had normal seasonality third quarter and fourth quarter. So, while our current view of G-SIB number is an estimate, we're quite confident that we wound up comfortably in the 5% bucket just as a result of normal seasonality. It was actually a relatively quiet December in terms of the types of year-end things that sometimes create pressures of various types. So that is more or less what you might have otherwise expected in terms of our typical seasonal patterns. So, not much to see there.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,9,Q and A,Q4_2024,2025-01-15,JPMorgan,transcript,"Jeremy Barnum (CFO)
JPMorgan, Q4, 2024 Earnings Call Transcript, Page 9"
"And the obvious point also being that even under the existing proposed G-SIB rule, which is obviously a little bit hung up, with the smaller buckets and some of the recalibration and so on, it's not even sort of obvious that it would have mattered one way or the other. But, anyway, for now, we're managing to the current rules, and normal seasonality took us back under 5%. Okay, you mentioned the lawsuit. I think the only thing to say about that is that we are happy to see the clear recognition on the part of the Fed that many of the things that we've been talking about for a long time in terms of transparency and volatility, and some of the non-substantive bureaucratic burden associated with the CCAR process needs improvement. So, that's great.",year,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,9,Q and A,Q4_2024,2025-01-15,JPMorgan,transcript,"Jeremy Barnum (CFO)

"I think I won't speak for the industry bodies that were the actual litigants, but it seems to me, if you just read what they said publicly in their press releases, this is as much as anything about preserving rights in light of the statute of limitations deadlines that were coming up.

"And then, taking a step back, at a high level, what you're really asking me is, what is our core view about, and I think probably the best way to think about this is just through the lens of the numerator, actually. What is our core view about if you just, for the sake of argument, assume modest growth in the normalized amount of economic denominator, like actual need for capital organically, what will be the likely additional numerator that will be needed or not as a function of the environment.",year,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,9,Q and A,Q4_2024,2025-01-15,JPMorgan,transcript,"Jeremy Barnum (CFO)

"And the way we're increasingly thinking about that is just doing different scenario analysis of like flat numerator, up 5% numerator, up 10% numerator, up 20% numerator. I guess there could be some versions of the world where the numerator's a little less. And then guessing about our central case and comparing our projected capital amount to that number to determine the excess. And as you point out, at 15.7%, and I think the actual quantum of the numerator is something like $275 billion, through pretty much any reasonable lens, it's a ton of excess, which is why we've concluded that it doesn't need to grow anymore.",year,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,9,Q and A,Q4_2024,2025-01-15,JPMorgan,transcript,"Jeremy Barnum (CFO)

"And just a follow-up question – a follow-up to John's line of questioning. As a placeholder, as we think about what you said, trying to arrest the growth of CET1, for now, should we just assume that anything that you don't need for organic growth and your dividend obligations in terms of that 15.7% will be bought back by the company as we think about?

"Good morning. It seems like you guys have backed off the view that you're materially over-earning on net interest income. And is this all because of the higher rate environment that's expected now?

"Yeah, it's a good question, Matt. I guess maybe let me try to frame this from a couple different perspectives. So, on the one hand, you're right. If you look at the NII guidance that we're giving you, including the notion that subject to the yield curve panning out in line with the current forwards, which, as we know, is the one thing that we know won't happen. But if you want to assume something, if you assume the forwards, we're sort of telling you that we might return to sequential growth in the back half of the year, again, based on all of our current assumptions, all else being equal.

"I think if you take a big step back, by historical standards, the difference between the policy rate and the weighted average rate paid on consumer deposits remains quite elevated for a variety of reasons and subject to the fact that in the end, deposit pricing is always going to be a response to the competitive environment that we experience in the field, the current structure of the yield curve is such that, for the time being anyway, when we do the math, that's what we see.

It's just that the strategy is very different and it's a very different moment. So it's a new initiative. It's obviously not risk-free, but it's going pretty well. And pointing out the obvious, if we didn't think it was worth it, we wouldn't be doing it. But we have obviously considered all of the risks and opportunities associated with the decision.

It's been a great call with a lot of robust questions here. You're like, what else is there to ask? Here's my question. As we think about the NII outlook and you highlighted the NIM pressure, but loan – but basically, balance is increasing here, right? Maybe you could just speak to – could you help me understand the order of the drivers? Is it QT going away, deposits going up, punch it into securities? Is it loan growth inflecting? Is there any place in the franchise where you see loan growth opportunities for inflection this coming year? And then lastly, as I think about your comments around you've got the green market share number one, you've got the yellow, you've got the red, places maybe we can't see. Could you help us understand where those yellows and reds are – where they are? Are they just scattered, everybody – every single business has one? Or are there some that have more than others and, therefore, more opportunities? And is it more balance sheet or fee-generative? That's kind of what I'd like to just discuss if you have a minute.

"Sure. Yeah, let me take a crack at that, Betsy. So, loan growth, I think looking for areas where it might inflect, the only thing I can think of, frankly, that would be in that category, certainly in terms of being meaningful to the company's performance, would be acquisition finance because that's been relatively muted as a a function of the M&A environment, and if that picks up you could see more there. Now, those aren't loans that we necessarily keep on the balance sheet for that long, so whether that shows up in fees or NII or whatever, it's a separate issue.",year,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,12,Q and A,Q4_2024,2025-01-15,JPMorgan,transcript,"Jeremy Barnum (CFO)

"But as you can see like on our presentation page for the NII outlook, you know that Card loan growth and revolve normalization has been a significant tailwind. And while that is also a driver of growth in 2025, again, based on our current guess about the future, it will be – it's decelerating a little bit, rather than the opposite.",year,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,12,Q and A,Q4_2024,2025-01-15,JPMorgan,transcript,"Jeremy Barnum (CFO)

"Still growing above trend obviously, which is great, and it's a sign of the strength of the franchise and the amount of engagement that we're getting from our Card clients, but the big normalization tailwinds there are gone. You know well the state of the mortgage market given rates. Rates are also a headwind in some other pockets like our multifamily lending business at the margin. So, yeah, I think a higher growth environment, a little bit more optimism, could you see a bit more loan growth in Business Banking? Could you see a bit more growth in C&I at the margin? Yes. But I think the place where you might see inflection is more in the areas that are deal-driven, I would say. So, we'll see.

"And in terms of the reds and the ambers under the green, I think you know them, right? And they're aligned with our big long-standing investment strategies. The biggest single one arguably is that in what you might call the affluent section of the Wealth Management space, we are significantly underpenetrated relative to the number of households that we bank in the country and our capabilities and our brand and what we think we bring to the table. So, that's why we're pushing so hard on that front, because I think we can get more share there and it completes the franchise very nicely. There are a bunch of examples elsewhere, but we talk a lot about drilling down inside the Markets business, inside Investment Banking and finding the places where even where at the aggregate global sector level we look great and any given region and any given subsector we can do better.

Even if we don't get any rates cut, when you look through your customer base where do you see areas of vulnerability, be it because of tariffs, be it because of just lack of any additional relief from the Fed?

"Oh, I see where your question is. That took me a second. Yeah, I mean, look, wholesale credit is pretty hard to predict. It tends to be very idiosyncratic. You obviously know that we're coming out of a 10-plus year period of an exceptionally low charge-off rate, and so at some point that has to normalize to a slightly more reasonable level, a little bit to Jamie's comments earlier about how some things are still not fully normalized, and arguably wholesale credit could be one of those. We do run extensive stress tests on the sensitivities to the portfolio – of the portfolio to rate shock. A lot of what we do from an underwriting perspective is designed to protect us from that, frankly. So, you can rest assured that we're running the relevant analysis, but I'm not inclined to go into detail on any given sector or whatever.

"I would just point the biggest driver of credit has been and always will be unemployment. That's both in the consumer side and it bleeds into the corporate side. It bleeds into mortgages, sub-prime, credit card. So, really, it's your forecast of unemployment, which you have to make your own, which will determine that over time. And so, the second thing you said, vulnerabilities, it's unemployment, but the worst case would be stagflation. Higher rates with higher unemployment will drive higher credit losses literally across the board.

"Yeah. I think the conventional wisdom on QT, and I'm not pretending to add to the conventional wisdom one way or the other, is that the tapering should sort of complete and, therefore, we might see an end sometime in the middle of the year. Of course, they may change that, but that seems to be the current market consensus. And when we sort of take a step back and look at the H.8 data and our kind of flow of funds models and that type of stuff, when you look at the way our peers are behaving, evolution of QT, expectations for economy-wide loan growth, et cetera, and what the impact of that might be on the growth of system-wide deposits, it's kind of consistent with the story that we're telling about sort of the background growth in our NII outlook, plus or minus, what happens with the policy rate and stabilizing and growing deposit balances through the second half of the year.",year,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,13,Q and A,Q4_2024,2025-01-15,JPMorgan,transcript,"Jeremy Barnum (CFO)

"That's fascinating, Gerard. I’ll have to take a look at that data. I don't actually recognize those numbers. But I can speak for ourselves, which is that when we look at the encouraging growth that we see in our checking franchise, it's a couple of things. So, of course, there was some excess, and there was some yield-seeking behavior. So you did see people moving money out of checking into higher-yielding alternatives over the course of the last couple of years in the rate cycle. It feels to us as if we're in the final innings of that. We're just not seeing nearly as much yield-seeking pressure as we had seen.
