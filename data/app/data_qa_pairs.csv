"Hi, thank you, a simple one. I appreciate the many, many moving parts, but your first quarter Net Interest Income and revenue production was great, and if you just annualize it, you're handily ahead of your full year guide. So I'm just curious on how you're thinking about maintaining the guide but running ahead of schedule.","Yeah, thanks, Glenn, and good morning. Appreciate the question. Look, we did have a very solid first quarter, but as Jane mentioned in her prepared remarks, there are a number of things that are still out there in the global macro environment that are uncertain and unclear, including, frankly, as we contemplate the direction of rates and what's required to tame inflation, let alone the uncertainty that we've seen in parts of the sector here through the quarter.",Analyst,CFO,2023,Citigroup,Q1_2023,1,-0.319,1_the_you_and_that,Capital Adequacy,Capital Adequacy,2023-03-31,Q1_2023,Capital Risk,Negative
"So, slide 25 and 26 people should look at because they're great and they show the stability of your deposit franchise, but I'm curious if history can change at all. Meaning right now, those are cash and operating deposits that clients keep with you and they need you, and you're fully integrated, but do you have client concentrations we should know about or are you thinking about any big changes that can happen in terms of client behavior relative to the past in terms of what they keep at any given bank? I know it's a tough one.","Glenn, I'll kick it off and pass it over to Mark. I feel very comfortable about how very well-diversified our deposit base is across different countries, industries, clients, and currencies. It's extremely strong in that respect, and as you say, the majority of the Institutional deposits are integrated into the operating accounts all around the world to enable the clients to run their day-to-day operations, the payroll, the working capital, the supplier financing, et cetera.",Analyst,CEO,2023,Citigroup,Q1_2023,1,0.883,1_the_you_and_that,Liquidity Risk,Liquidity Risk,2023-03-31,Q1_2023,Liquidity Risk,Positive
"Can you talk about for the fee growth? I mean, we kind of understand the Net Interest Income growth, but the fee growth is double-digits also, so I guess that's money in motion and I think you described this as the world's largest wholesale global payments system. What's happening to give you double-digit top line growth there?","Oh, thank you, Mike, and a great question. I think one of the numbers I'm almost more happy about than the stellar revenue growth was the fee growth quarter-over-quarter here because obviously, we've been benefiting in Treasury and Trade Solutions from the rates environment but we've also been benefiting from the drivers behind the franchise. And the fee revenues are coming from multiple different products and different offerings that we have here, and we're typically looking and have consistently looked at growing our fee revenue as a percentage of the underlying growth in Treasury and Trade Solutions.",Analyst,CEO,2023,Citigroup,Q1_2023,1,0.9494,1_the_you_and_that,Profitability,Profitability,2023-03-31,Q1_2023,Other,Positive
"Okay. And then as it relates to rates generally, what is it, like, over 90% of your rate sensitivity is outside the US, and so shouldn't you be benefiting more than you originally thought given some of these rate hikes? And I guess, Mark, are you just sandbagging a little bit? I get the uncertainties and the Investment Banking Return on Average Tangible Common Equity: Return on Average Tangible backlog pushed out, and, no I mean, we want you to have a reasonable bar to jump over and I'm just wondering if you set the bar high enough for yourself for this year.","Yeah, so again, I think that there is certainly more opportunity in terms of how rates move and capturing Net Interest Income as you pointed out outside of the US. We articulate our interest rate exposure for a parallel shift and that mix at the end of last year was the 90/10 that you mentioned for non-US. As I sit here in March, it probably is going to skew a little bit less non-US and a little bit more towards the US, and you'll see that in the 10-Q.",Analyst,CFO,2023,Citigroup,Q1_2023,1,0.9134,1_the_you_and_that,Interest Rate Risk,Interest Rate Risk,2023-03-31,Q1_2023,Market Risk,Positive
"Hi, good morning. I know during the prepared remarks you talked a bit about Andy Sieg coming on board, and I just wanted to understand how to think about the outlook for what you're doing with Wealth, not only in the US but the non-US locations, and also try to understand how much capital you think you could apply to that business relative to what you have today. Thanks.","Hey there Betsy. So, we're obviously delighted that Andy is joining as our new Global Head of Wealth around my table, and he's a tremendous leader with a great track record driving growth. He's got deep product and digital expertise; a proven people leader and we'll certainly be taking full advantage of his expertise and experience in the US.",Analyst,CEO,2023,Citigroup,Q1_2023,1,0.9506,1_the_you_and_that,Capital Adequacy,Capital Adequacy,2023-03-31,Q1_2023,Capital Risk,Positive
"My first question is a follow-up to Betsy. I think everybody were certainly impressed, Jane, at the Andy Sieg hire, and clearly, he was running a much larger business than what Citi has today. And this is sort of a tricky question. Clearly, you're still working through some of the transformation. There's still a consent order, but given your strength as a global player, could Citi participate in perhaps inorganic opportunities that could be out there, having a result perhaps of the liquidity crisis that we saw that could potentially enhance your Wealth Management footprint more quickly?","We see plenty of potential for organic growth potential, and I think that's really where we're going to be focusing, Erika, because I look at the Private Bank and the family office, there is so much wealth creation supplemented by our Commercial Banking relationships with a lot of the enterprises and the owners of those enterprises who are really generating the new industry champions in country after country, and we're extremely well-positioned to capture that.",Analyst,CEO,2023,Citigroup,Q1_2023,1,0.8966,1_the_you_and_that,Capital Adequacy,Capital Adequacy,2023-03-31,Q1_2023,Capital Risk,Positive
"Hey, good morning. Maybe just a question on capital. Appreciate the fact that the potential sale of the Mexico franchise would be a negative impact, but you're sitting at a pretty comfortable cushion now above your target. Obviously your expected future retained earnings growth should be more than an offset, so how do we think about, how are you thinking about the timing of restarting buybacks with your stock as cheap as it is?","Yeah, thanks, Jim, and good morning. As you point out, we grew capital pretty sizably this quarter, up to 13.4% from a Common Equity Tier 1 ratio point of view and up significantly from a year ago, some 200 basis points or so. And a good portion of that, a significant portion of that, was really net income earnings generation, which is important.",Analyst,CFO,2023,Citigroup,Q1_2023,1,0.9403,1_the_you_and_that,Capital Adequacy,Capital Adequacy,2023-03-31,Q1_2023,Capital Risk,Positive
"Yeah, all fair. And then maybe as a follow-up, just, you mentioned increased macro assumptions embedded in reserves. Where are you now on the macro assumptions in the reserve book?","So in terms of the reserve, again, remember we have a couple of different scenarios that we run when we calculate the Current Expected Credit Losses reserves. Our current reserves are based on those three macroeconomic scenarios. It reflects a 5.1% or so unemployment rate on a weighted basis over eight quarters, so that's relatively flat versus last quarter.",Analyst,CFO,2023,Citigroup,Q1_2023,1,-0.5915,1_the_you_and_that,Capital Adequacy,Capital Adequacy,2023-03-31,Q1_2023,Capital Risk,Negative
"Hey, good morning. So I wanted to start off with a question just on the Investment Banking Return on Average Tangible Common Equity: Return on Average Tangible and trading outlook. On the trading side, just given some of the recent macro shocks, have you seen any evidence of bad volatility and are you still confident that you can sustain that mid-single-digit growth target? And just on the Investment Banking side, I wanted to see if there's any evidence of green shoots. It's been a challenging backdrop, as you noted, Mark, but I was hoping you could offer some color just across some of the different product lines, across Mergers & Acquisitions, Equity Capital Markets, Debt Capital Markets.","Why don't I start, and then, Jane, feel free to jump in. Look, we saw better performance in the quarter in Markets than when I talked at the conference earlier in the quarter. And really that played through in our Fixed Income business which was up about 4% year-over-year driven largely by strength in Rates and we saw rate volatility in the back end of the quarter and we were well-positioned to take advantage of that and serve clients and that aided getting us to down 4% in aggregate across Markets.",Analyst,CFO,2023,Citigroup,Q1_2023,1,0.9198,1_the_you_and_that,Profitability,Profitability,2023-03-31,Q1_2023,Other,Positive
"That's great. And for my follow-up, just on PBWM fee income trends, I'm not going to ask you about the broader Wealth strategy, but we're big fans of Andy here, so congrats on the hire. The one thing I did want to get a better sense of is how much of the sequential improvement that we saw in fees is a function of just partner payments being higher as credit continues to normalize, and how we should be thinking about the trajectory in fees within PBWM over the remainder of this year?","I think there are a couple of things to kind of keep in mind in terms of PBWM fees, and I think part of it is that PBWM is a combination of both the Cards business as well as the Wealth business, and a good amount of the pressure that we've seen in fees and that is still subject to how the environment evolves is in the Wealth space, because we continue to see fee pressure on investment activity and revenues there, and we'll have to see how the market valuations move on some of the assets that we manage on behalf of clients and what momentum it drives in terms of more investment activity. So I think that's a big part of the drag in fees.",Analyst,CFO,2023,Citigroup,Q1_2023,1,0.7783,1_the_you_and_that,Profitability,Profitability,2023-03-31,Q1_2023,Other,Positive
"Hello. You guys have talked about bending the curve on costs I think in the latter part of 2024, and I wanted to see if that's still the case. And I guess maybe just some clarification on what bending the curve means. Is that slowing expense growth, absolute drop, any kind of clarity on that, and costs in general kind of medium-term would be helpful. Thank you.","Thank, Matt. To answer your question very directly, yes, it is still the case. We are going to bend the curve, as I mentioned, towards the end of 2024. It does mean an absolute dollar reduction in expenses.",Analyst,CFO,2023,Citigroup,Q1_2023,1,0.6682,1_the_you_and_that,Interest Rate Risk,Interest Rate Risk,2023-03-31,Q1_2023,Market Risk,Positive
"Okay. That's helpful. And then, I think in the past you've kind of insinuated that's like the start of hopefully a more material drop in costs beyond, obviously this is far away, but just any additional color there too. Thank you.","Yeah, look, again, look, the expense base is a key area of focus for us, right? We recognize that expenses have been growing. They've been growing because we've been investing in the franchise both transformation-wise as well as business-led growth to support the competitive advantages that we have in many of our franchises, but we're managing that very actively and very deliberately, and that means that we're looking to ensure that we're spending the money in the right way in the right places and that we're going to yield the benefits that we expect from that over time. And that was all factored into the targets that we set at our Investor Day for the medium-term, and what that requires is that we start bending the curve in 2024 as I stated and that we end in that medium-term at a place where we have an operating efficiency of about 60% and we're positioned to have returns that are in that 11% to 12% Return on Average Tangible Common Equity point of view.",Analyst,CFO,2023,Citigroup,Q1_2023,1,0.964,1_the_you_and_that,Interest Rate Risk,Interest Rate Risk,2023-03-31,Q1_2023,Market Risk,Positive
"Thank you. Hi, Jane. Hi, Mark. A couple questions. Jane, maybe starting with you first, or Mark, both of you can answer it. In view of what the disruptions we've seen in the banking system in the month of March with what went on with the regional banks here in the US and obviously the large investment bank over in Switzerland, do you guys see changes coming, or what changes do you see coming in terms of regulatory whether it's more capital, more liquidity, and it may not be directed at a company like yours because you're a global SIFI already and it might be more regionally orientated in the United States. And as part of this question, Jane, can you guys give us some color on the deposit you and your peers made into First Republic? What was the thinking behind that as well?","Sure. Thank you for the question, Gerard. Well, I'd say that we hope that there will be a thoughtful and targeted approach to any changes in the regulatory and capital framework and that they address the root causes of what actually happened here, and what happened is a combination of macro impacts from the sharp, rapid rate increases and some idiosyncratic situations, namely a lack of proper asset and liability management at a small handful of banks.",Analyst,CEO,2023,Citigroup,Q1_2023,1,0.8689,1_the_you_and_that,Liquidity Risk,Liquidity Risk,2023-03-31,Q1_2023,Liquidity Risk,Positive
"Thank you. Thanks for taking my questions, Mark and Jane. Mark, I want to go to your revenue, I hear you, you're keeping the revenue guidance unchanged. What is in your revenue assumption, just want to unpeel that onion a little bit. What's in your revenue assumption for rates, US and internationally, and what is going on with deposit betas particularly following the inflows you've seen recently in the US with the crisis?","Yeah, so, I guess a couple things. One, in terms of the rates that we've assumed, in the balance of the year, we've kind of assumed that rates would flatten out after this quarter, after this second quarter and then trend down a bit towards the end of the year. Down a bit to something like 4.50% or so, so we may have one rate increase and then flat and then down to about 4.50%. That could change, but candidly, if it changes a little bit here or there, it's unlikely to have a meaningful impact in 2023. That's likely to have more of an impact in 2024. So we can debate that curve, but that's kind of what we have thus far in our outlook. And that’s US rates.",Analyst,CFO,2023,Citigroup,Q1_2023,1,0.714,1_the_you_and_that,Profitability,Profitability,2023-03-31,Q1_2023,Other,Positive
"And just as a clarification, with the inflows you've seen recently in deposits with the crisis, this is in the US, obviously, are the betas tempering a little bit, how much those are going up? Is that slowing down, or not any change so far?","So a couple things I mentioned. So one, we did see inflows in the quarter associated with some of the sector turmoil. We've looked at kind of deposit levels from call it March 7th, March 8th through close to the end of March, and we certainly did see an uptick, call it probably a little bit under $30 billion or so of inflows in that period of time, with a good portion of that in our Citi Commercial Bank, our Commercial Middle-Market client base.",Analyst,CFO,2023,Citigroup,Q1_2023,1,0.4215,1_the_you_and_that,Liquidity Risk,Liquidity Risk,2023-03-31,Q1_2023,Liquidity Risk,Positive
"Thanks. Hey, Mark, just a follow-up on the credit. So you mentioned obviously that you moved your part of your Current Expected Credit Losses adjustment a little bit in your weightings, and you had previously talked about getting towards normalized card losses, I think you'd said by around the end of the year. So can you just given the changes that we're seeing ahead of us and definitely saw some normalization happen this quarter, can you just, are you still on line for that getting to that 3-3.5% and 5-5.5% in the respective card businesses by around year-end this year?","Yeah, year-end, early next year, yes. We're still kind of on track, on trend for that. Again, I'd expect that they pick up a little bit after that before they start tapering down. But the answer to your question, Ken, is yes. That's still the timeline, fourth quarter, early 2024 reaching those normalized levels.",Analyst,CFO,2023,Citigroup,Q1_2023,1,0.802,1_the_you_and_that,Asset Quality and Credit Risk,Asset Quality and Credit Risk,2023-03-31,Q1_2023,Credit Risk,Positive
"Okay, cool. And then one more just follow-up. End-of-period deposits down 3%, you mentioned the taxes. Are the taxes, is the tax impact felt across the business? When I look at the deposits page, there are a lot of ins and there are a lot of outs on an end-of-period basis, and just trying to get a sense of like what areas might have been impacted by that tax seasonality and where there was just some of the other pieces that you've already talked through in terms of inflows, outflows, and everything else in between.","Yeah, it's a good question. So, again, when you look at our deposits on an average basis, you see on page 26 that they tick up a little bit. If you look at it on an end of period basis, they're down about 3%, and essentially, intra-quarter, particularly in March as I mentioned earlier, we did see a sizable increase in flows. With that said, if you remember in the fourth quarter, we saw a nice run-up in deposits, and then we have the seasonality point that I referenced in my prepared remarks where we have both operational payments from our large Treasury and Trade Solutions clients as well as tax payments with our Treasury and Trade Solutions clients, also with Wealth clients to some extent kind of playing through the end-of-period deposits. And again, that for the most part is normal operating payments that we'd expect to see at this time of year.",Analyst,CFO,2023,Citigroup,Q1_2023,1,0.9633,1_the_you_and_that,Liquidity Risk,Liquidity Risk,2023-03-31,Q1_2023,Liquidity Risk,Positive
"Hi. Just one clarification on that last answer. You said you had intra-quarter flows. Did you gain more deposits in the month of March, and was that in the US?","Yes, that's what I was talking about, Mike, in terms of those flows. They did come largely in the US in the month of March, call it March 8th through kind of the end of March. They were overshadowed by these normal payments that I referenced, and we did, we still see good activity kind of even as we came through March and into early parts of April.",Analyst,CFO,2023,Citigroup,Q1_2023,1,0.6808,1_the_you_and_that,Liquidity Risk,Liquidity Risk,2023-03-31,Q1_2023,Liquidity Risk,Positive
"What if the deposits for those 5,000 multinationals, and I know I'm asking you to slice and dice in a little bit different way, but even just a general sense, because the reason I'm asking this is because I think there's a disconnect between showing percent of uninsured deposits as a measure of stickiness, and I don't think that's valid, and you've showed higher deposits even though you have a big percentage of uninsured deposits or maybe that doesn't matter as much as some front pages of newspapers are suggesting, so if you could address that.","Yeah, thanks, Mike. Look, I'd tell you to turn to page 26 in the earnings presentation. We've broken down the deposits for each of the businesses that we have, and at the bottom, you see the Treasury and Trade Solutions deposits, and this is where the 5,000 or so large multinational client deposits reside, and you can see the stability, as well as the steady growth in those deposits over time. And to your point, these are largely operational deposits that these clients have with us, and we shouldn't mistake rate sensitivity or betas with stickiness, right, and it's because these deposits tend to be quite sticky with us, as you can see here.",Analyst,CFO,2023,Citigroup,Q1_2023,1,0.8495,1_the_you_and_that,Liquidity Risk,Liquidity Risk,2023-03-31,Q1_2023,Liquidity Risk,Positive
"Hi. Well, you just finished your seventh month of your org simplification and you said 7,000 positions go away, with $1.5 billion of expense savings. So that's very concrete, but more generally, after 20, 30, 40 years of matrix structure down to five lines of business, you're reporting these differently, you're talking about them differently, but the question that I think a lot of people have is, are you simply reporting these lines of business differently, or are you actually running them differently? Thanks.","Thank you, Mike, for the question. The simplification that we've just gone through, it is what we said it is. It is the most consequential set of changes, not only to the organization model that we have but how we run the bank. It's aligned the structure with the strategy. It's simplified the bank. It's eliminated needless complexity. It's created greater transparency into the five businesses and their performance as you can see. It's increased accountability.

"So, could you take us just conceptually where we're going to – where you think you'll drive that growth from, from this baseline where we're at now? And if you want, you can totally use my second question in there and tell us what good things you're doing inside the Investment Banking line.","You snuck that one in, Glenn. So I'll kick off with some of this, pass it to Mark and then I'll come back to Banking. So look, we are laser-focused on the growth and improving the returns of these businesses to where they should and will be in the medium term, and it's not just the growth story, but let me anchor it in those medium-term return targets.",Analyst,CEO,2024,Citigroup,Q1_2024,1,0.5423,1_the_you_and_that,Profitability,Profitability,2024-03-31,Q1_2024,Other,Positive
"I guess a couple of questions. Well, so I know we talked through the Institutional Securities business already on moving that expense ratio a little bit. Could we dig in a little bit on the Wealth side, because the expense ratio there is running a little higher, and so, it'd be useful just to understand the pace or speed or timeframe when we should expect to see that start to inflect.","Yes, absolutely. And some of it, just as a reminder, the actions that we've been taking on org simplification and that Andy has also been taking in the Wealth business. We will work through notice periods in the coming weeks. And so, you'll start – you'll see the impact coming through in our head count numbers, and in Wealth, in the expense base next quarter. Look, as Mark said in his opening and Andy has been talking about, this should be a – sort of up to a 30% pre-tax margin business.",Analyst,CEO,2024,Citigroup,Q1_2024,1,0.8442,1_the_you_and_that,Capital Adequacy,Capital Adequacy,2024-03-31,Q1_2024,Capital Risk,Positive
"Okay. Good morning. Jane and Mark, I very much appreciate the comments on your growth opportunities and driving growth. But revenues are often dictated by the macro that is a little bit out of your control. So, can you talk a little bit about the flexibility on the expenses? You have a range in 2026 of $51 billion to $53 billion. So, if revenues are coming in below the targets, is it, I guess, A, fair to assume you'd be at the very low-end of that range or is – and I think there is some revenue growth built in there. So, is there some flexibility to the downside to try to get to your targets in a tougher revenue environment? Thanks.","Yeah. Look, the top line growth, as you've heard us say, is a Compound Annual Growth Rate of 4% to 5%. We've put that target out there of $51 billion to $53 billion as a range of what we're working towards. We've given you a good sense of how we expect to get there with the $2 billion to $2.5 billion reduction by then.

"Thank you. I guess just one question, Mark, around capital. So, you talked about $13 billion over the reg minimum. Like you could easily be doing 2x the buyback you did in one quarter, if not more. I know you don't like to talk about out-quarters, but give us a sense of the case this quarter. Should we expect the pace of buybacks to increase? And if you could provide additional color as we think about the rest of the year would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.","Sure. Look, you know and I've said it repeatedly, Jane has said it repeatedly, given where we trade, we think buying back is Surveillance, Monitoring, and and we'd like to do as much as we possibly can and as much as makes sense in light of the uncertainty that's out there. We have run at about 13.5% this quarter. That does give us capacity above the 13.3%. But it's important to keep in mind that there's client demand that will continue to evolve. We want to make sure we can support the clients that want to do business with us, whether that be in Markets or other parts of the franchise.",Analyst,CFO,2024,Citigroup,Q1_2024,1,0.8608,1_the_you_and_that,Capital Adequacy,Capital Adequacy,2024-03-31,Q1_2024,Capital Risk,Positive
"How are you balancing – clearly, your valuation would demand that the buybacks be ramped up from $500 million. But growing revenues at a 4% to 5% Compound Annual Growth Rate would mean potentially some capital plowed back into the business. I guess how are you balancing that, especially given that the demand for buyback is louder at Citi than any other money center peer? And could you give us a sense of what card late fees are and how that would impact the $80 billion to $81 billion for the year if we do get an earlier implementation than October?","Yeah. Thank you, Erika. On the first part of the question, I'd just remind you and everyone else that we're playing for the long-term here, right. So, we have set some medium-term targets. Obviously, Jane has recasted the vision and the strategy. I think we're making very good progress against that, but we're playing for the long-term.

"Thanks. Mark, I was hoping you'd give a little more color on how you're feeling about the credit card charge-offs. You maintained the outlook for the year. You mentioned the higher end on Retail Services. Do you still feel like you'll see a peak this year? And what kind of metrics are you looking at in terms of delinquency formation and seasoning to inform that view that you might see the peak in card charge-offs this year?","Yeah. Thanks, John. We have obviously continued to manage this portfolio very actively. We've seen continued top line growth. We've seen continued average interest-earning balance growth. We've talked about how we expect for the cost of credit to normalize, and we've seen that continue to happen. The range that we've given on Branded Cards, we're inside of that range. When you look at the spend across the portfolios, the spend is really happening with the affluent customers more so than anything else. And so, we're watching the lower income customer profile – or customers that we have.

"Okay and on the Branded side, you still expect kind of the peak-ish? Are you still inside of the range for the full year and expect 2025, you could move lower on the Branded charge-offs?","Yes, I still kind of expect that trend line of peaking and then kind of moving a bit lower in Branded.",Analyst,CFO,2024,Citigroup,Q1_2024,1,0.128,1_the_you_and_that,Asset Quality and Credit Risk,Asset Quality and Credit Risk,2024-03-31,Q1_2024,Credit Risk,Neutral
"Great. Thanks. Can I follow up on the card line of thinking and just ask you, Mark, to talk a little bit about just cost of credit? We did still see some card related build this quarter even with the comments you just made and seasonal softer loan growth So, just from a bigger picture perspective, how do you think, continue to think about reserve builds from here and how that informs your outlook for cost of credit?","Yeah, sure. Look, I think that when I think about the reserve builds, I think it's the same factors that come into play. So, obviously, the view on the macro is important. And right now, if you think about some of the key macro factors that impact the cards portfolio, the unemployment assumptions weighted is about 5%, the downside is about 7% kind of weighted over the period. And so, how that evolves will be an important factor. How HPI evolves would be an important consideration here for this portfolio, but also what happens with volumes becomes a factor on reserve builds and how important or how much they increase or decrease.",Analyst,CFO,2024,Citigroup,Q1_2024,1,0.7814,1_the_you_and_that,Interest Rate Risk,Interest Rate Risk,2024-03-31,Q1_2024,Market Risk,Positive
"Okay. And a separate question on Treasury and Trade Solutions. That Net Interest Income related to Treasury and Trade Solutions has been remarkable with rising rates. This quarter, granted there was a lesser day and there could be currency stuff in there, the first quarter that it stepped back, I'm just wondering like where is that in its asset liability sensitivity, the Treasury and Trade Solutions Net Interest Income, and what are your thoughts about that piece of the Net Interest Income puzzle going forward? Thanks.","Sure, yeah. I mean, I think I'd say a couple things. We do have kind of some Argentina playing through the Net Interest Income line. I will say that the best way to think about it is kind of the underlying beta activity. And we have seen, this is the corporate client, it is an institutional client. We have seen betas, particularly in the US, at kind of normalized or terminal levels and playing a bit through that. We are seeing betas outside of the US continue to increase as it relates to the Treasury and Trade Solutions client base.",Analyst,CFO,2024,Citigroup,Q1_2024,1,0.9524,1_the_you_and_that,Profitability,Profitability,2024-03-31,Q1_2024,Other,Positive
"Hi. Thank you. Jane, Mark, just a question maybe on Argentina, you've shown $100 million in Net Interest Income. Total net income benefit of $500 million after-tax, so probably implying about $500 million, $600 million of non-interest income benefit. Which line item – sorry, which segment did that come through, and is that sustainable?","Yeah, look, there's a mix obviously of things that are driving that net income, including a tax impact on the heels of last year Argentina devaluation activity that's in that line. But the short answer is that if you think about the nature of the business that we do in Argentina, it is a big part of our institutional client relationships. And the primary activities include some of the Treasury and Trade Solutions-type of activities that we've talked about, so liquidity management, payments, custody within the Services business. And so, you'd see a good portion of the activity in Argentina playing through the Services business, some of it in Markets as well, but again, the majority of the activity in Services.",Analyst,CFO,2024,Citigroup,Q1_2024,1,0.8978,1_the_you_and_that,Profitability,Profitability,2024-03-31,Q1_2024,Other,Positive
"Hey, everyone. Thanks for taking the question. Mark, I think you touched on at least a component of this a couple questions ago, but maybe just broadly an update on your rate positioning. I guess I only ask, because it looks like we might be starting to diverge in terms of global rate trajectories, if we potentially go lower in Europe, but higher here for a while. In the aggregate, do these kind of complicate your management or make you feel better or worse about the overall Net Interest Income momentum for the company?","Yeah, let me try and take it in, in two pieces, I guess. So one is, if I think about how the rate implieds have evolved from the 3 to 6 to now something a little bit north of 1 in the context of what I expect for our performance, it doesn't have a material impact on the guidance that I've given of $80 billion to $81 billion.",Analyst,CFO,2024,Citigroup,Q1_2024,1,0.296,1_the_you_and_that,Interest Rate Risk,Interest Rate Risk,2024-03-31,Q1_2024,Market Risk,Positive
"Hi, Mark. Hi, Jane. Mark, can you share with us, there's been obviously a lot of conversation around the credit card charge-offs and the credit quality there. If we could shift over to the corporate side, which obviously is very strong, we have seen spreads narrow in the markets on high-yield corporate debt, leverage debt, etcetera. It's very robust out there, but around the global geopolitical risk, do you think the spreads would be widening? Can you guys share with us what you're seeing on the corporate side in terms of competition? Are underwriting standards getting a little bit weaker now as people are trying to grow their books, what are you seeing on that front?","So, look, we're still seeing good demand for corporate credit. And what I'd say is that we've been very disciplined about where we want to play on the risk profile here. We've been very disciplined in terms of the investment-grade large multinationals that we serve. And that hasn't shifted from an underwriting point of view.

"Hi. Good afternoon. I'll change tacks a little bit here, but I'm curious if there's any update on the Mexican IPO and more specifically, I'm kind of curious how set in stone the IPO process is. You will have a new administration and even if it's a candidate from the same party, she may have a less confrontational view of the private sector, perhaps be more allowing of a local bank to extract value from buying a bank. I guess if the facts on the ground were to change, would you be open to a sale potentially being back on the table, because it does seem like this is a situation where a private market valuation could be higher and even materially higher than the public market valuation.","The guiding principle that we have and we've had all along is making sure that we make a decision here that is in the best interest of our shareholders and makes the most sense for them. We are – we never say never, but we are very focused on the IPO path here. We believe it is the right one for our shareholders. We're well on track in the path in Mexico. We're very pleased to bring Ignacio Deschamps in as the Banamex Chairman to help guide the IPO process. We announced the management teams for the two banks earlier this quarter.

Previously, you had talked about ""bending the cost curve"" between the third and the fourth quarter of this year, and on this call I thought I heard you say it's basically bent, that second quarter should be down and we should be sequentially lower from here, so did it just happen six months earlier or is there still some other bending that comes late this year?",I'll take it.

The macro scenario, Fed assumptions look quite similar to last year but just given the significant transformation that's underway, repositioning actions, which admittedly depressed earnings last year, want to get a sense as to whether there are any idio-factors that could result in greater SCB volatility in the coming exam and just broader thoughts on longer-term trajectory for the SCB, just given the org simplification efforts that are underway.","Yeah, Steven the first part of your question is just impossible to answer to be candid with you, right. I mean it's – we obviously have an internal based scenario we've run. We have a severely adverse scenario that we've run. We've provided a balance sheet as part of the submission, but ultimately, the regulators have to run through their models, the information that we've provided and that informs what happens with the stress capital buffer, and we don't have as much transparency to that as we'd like and so really hard to call at this stage.",Analyst,CFO,2024,Citigroup,Q1_2024,1,-0.6196,1_the_you_and_that,Capital Adequacy,Capital Adequacy,2024-03-31,Q1_2024,Capital Risk,Negative

A follow-up, Mark, you said Treasury and Trade Solutions, you said we will have growth in operational deposits, and I was just wondering what gives you such confidence that you will, or is that accelerating or the same pace or what?","We have seen growth in the quarter, in operating deposits. The confidence comes from the focus that we've had with our existing clients as well as the growth we've seen with new clients, doing more with existing in more countries, more deeply penetrating the commercial middle-market space, and so we've been very thoughtfully focused on deposits that obviously give us the most value and also, provide the most stickiness as it relates to that relationship and so yes, the confidence is rooted in what we're seeing in the way of underlying operating deposit growth including inside this quarter.",Analyst,CFO,2024,Citigroup,Q1_2024,1,0.9789,1_the_you_and_that,Liquidity Risk,Liquidity Risk,2024-03-31,Q1_2024,Liquidity Risk,Positive
"Oh, hi, thanks so much. I just wanted to make sure of one thing on the expenses. I know in the past you've talked about the fact that 1Q will be a little elevated with the restructuring. And you showed that was the $225 million in the quarter, and then when we look to 2Q, we should – should we still be expecting a step-down in 2Q? And is that step-down just the elimination of the $225 million or is there some restructuring that we're likely to see in 2Q as well? In other words, should I just fade sequentially 2Q, 3Q, 4Q to hit your annual number or is there a bigger step-down in 2Q that I should still be expecting here? Thanks.","Sure. I think you should just fade it, to answer your question very directly, but I'd also point out that in Q1, if you really look through to it, it has the $250 million of Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation charge in it, and so when you back that out, we effectively are coming in lower than what we had guided right. Despite that I'm telling you the same – I'm making the same point, which is you can expect a downward trend from here through to the end of the year and while there won't be additional restructuring charge, there will be the normal BAU activity around repositioning that plays through, so hopefully that answers your question, Betsy. The guidance still holds, and the downward trend is what we are managing towards, as we kind of play out the balance of the year.",Analyst,CFO,2024,Citigroup,Q1_2024,1,0.8968,1_the_you_and_that,Strategic and Business Model Risk,Strategic and Business Model Risk,2024-03-31,Q1_2024,Business Model Risk,Positive
"Hi, thanks very much. So, I know it's early, but I'm curious if you could help us with a refresher on Treasury and Trade Solutions and Services in general. In terms of what opportunities there's risk, but also opportunities in helping clients manage through this re-tariffing and redrawing of economic lines. I think about nationalization and vertical integration as bad things, but a lot of shifting, and maybe you can help clients deal with all that shifting. But anything any help there would be great.","Glenn, I would be delighted to do so. So, our diversified business mix is very well positioned for a variety of scenarios. We think we've got a very broad suite of products and services. And they are the ones that clients need if they're going to be repositioning for a new order in trade or broader impacts here. And think about what you've seen over the last few years where we played a very central role: the Ukraine- Russia war, China, the COVID-related supply chains. We saw a lot of growth from deepening with clients and acquiring new ones because they need us, because we have exactly the expertise and the products and services that multinational institutions need, and we have them in the places that they need it. Now, the mix of those different revenues, different products and services we have could be different depending on which scenario prevails.

"Hey good morning. Maybe Jane, just following up on that conversation, and you talked about leaning into, as being a port in the storm and leaning into it. So, I guess in the near term, are you seeing sort of demand already in terms of your balance sheet, whether it's raising liquidity and deposit flow like sort of flight to safety deposit flows and sort of the trading aspect of it from this volatility in April, have you sort of already seen greater demand from clients?","What I'd say about the clients at the moment, you're seeing deals still happening. We've done a number of them, as we've talked about, even over this last weekend, we were pretty busy, but I would say that most clients are pausing their plans.",Analyst,CEO,2025,Citigroup,Q1_2025,1,0.3071,1_the_you_and_that,Liquidity Risk,Liquidity Risk,2025-03-31,Q1_2025,Liquidity Risk,Positive
"Sure. No, I appreciate that color. And then maybe for Mark, I mean, you highlighted at least on a period-end basis, deposit growth and commercial loan growth looked pretty good on a period-end basis quarter-over-quarter. So, I guess when we think about the Net Interest Income assumptions, deposit and loan growth looks good, but anything different given the strong start to the Net Interest Income ex-Markets story and seemingly some good momentum in deposit and loan growth. Do you feel good, better, worse on sort of your Net Interest Income outlook for this year?","Yes. Thanks, Jim. Look, I continue to feel good about the Net Interest Income outlook. There's obviously uncertainty that Jane has referenced, but that 2% to 3% ex-Markets. We've talked in the past about what the tailwinds and headwinds are.

"Hi, I just wanted to continue the discussion about, on one hand you’re a port in the storm. You've been embedded decades and you're not a bunch of suitcase bankers. So that message has landed. On the other hand, I mean, you are the bank that facilitates global trade in the middle of a global trade war. And so, I think the concern is not just the possibility that that revenues will nosedive, but credit will implode or as I've heard many, many times that Citigroup is going to stub its toe, just 100 countries in the mix of it all. What else can you say in addition to what you said to either reassure investors that the oversight is strong or that you have your arms around the situation, the best that that you can, again, recognizing it's a fluid situation. Thank you.","So, you've seen us perform extremely well over the last few years in the face of pretty wrenching changes in the global economy. You’ve seen it with say, shifts in supply chains after COVID and then between the geopolitical tensions that are going on, you saw it in pretty significant changes that were happening from the Russia and Ukraine war. And you see us exactly as that, we are where the clients come, it's hedging for foreign exchange, interest rates, commodities, you see it for how they're looking at changing their financing around, and we tend to be the ones that are helping them reconfigure the flows. So, from that point of view, we are the active agent in a lot this mix. And we are a port in the storm as I said, Mike, we've got very strong balance sheet, capital and liquidity to deploy. We have the big strategic changes and organization changes behind us, and they're enabling us to be on the front foot.

"Okay. The flip side of this is you did say the drivers are same. They might be different in magnitude to take you from where you are now you had over 9% Return on Average Tangible Common Equity in the quarter. You said you're on track to get to 10% to 11% next year. Can you put a little meat on the bones kind of verbal waterfall chart, if you would, or maybe some numbers around org simplification stranded costs, productivity savings.

"I guess Mark, just wanted to on Slide 9 and the capital waterfall. I guess we are all thinking about what buybacks can do in the second half of this year. So, if you don't mind, one, the Risk-Weighted Assets sort of drag, the 32 basis points. Is that normal as we think about what the Risk-Weighted Assets consumption should look like? Just talk about that in the context of getting to a 13.1% Common Equity Tier 1 by the end of the year. And how we can back into the pace of buybacks.","Yes. So, I'd say a couple of things. So one, last quarter, we announced a $20 billion share repurchase program. And we continue to feel good about that program, as you would expect. And we increased our buybacks this year, or this quarter, I should say, to the $1.75 billion, seeing the strength of the performance that was playing out through the quarter. And so those are both, I think, indications of our continued commitment to returning capital to the shareholders. We're clear on where we're trading, and we're clear that, that is a Surveillance, Monitoring, and thing to do once we've funded demand from a client point of view across our businesses, that's accretive to returns. And so, the Risk-Weighted Assets consumption is tied to that demand that we see. We think we've seen good client demand across the platform that's helped drive the top line momentum that you see in each and every one of our businesses that's helped to drive the improved returns that you see in the quarter in each and every one of our businesses. And as we see that demand, again, accretive in returns, we'll be looking to meet that as a first priority. We are targeting the 13.1% [Common Equity Tier 1 Capital ratio] by the end of the year. But as you know, we'll get a new stressed capital buffer in June on the heels of the Dodd-Frank Act Stress Test/Comprehensive Capital Analysis work that's just been submitted, and we'll have to see what that tells us. That's hard to forecast as you well know. And so based on what that tells us will inform that downward trajectory, but that is what we're focused on. The combination of funding growth that's accretive to returns and returning capital to shareholders in a way that's consistent with that repurchase program.",Analyst,CFO,2025,Citigroup,Q1_2025,1,0.9298,1_the_you_and_that,Capital Adequacy,Capital Adequacy,2025-03-31,Q1_2025,Capital Risk,Positive
"Understood. And I guess you mentioned, I think, in your prepared remarks, the reserves on the card book went up to 8.2%. Remind us, I mean, I think, and the genesis of both questions is I think there's a fragility to your Return on Average Tangible Common Equity guidance for next year that I think makes investors nervous. And I'm just trying to get to the pieces around buybacks? And then in terms of credit, like how what's it baking in around the unemployment rate? What would cause you to ratchet up provisioning in the near term? What kind of an implied job market deterioration do we need to see for the credit outlook to deteriorate fast and materially? Thanks.","Yes. Let me take that in a couple of different pieces. So, the first thing I'd say is that as I look at our credit exposure and I look at the consumer, the consumer continues to be resilient and discerning in their spend. And in fact, we did see spend hold up in the quarter, and we saw spend actually increase in our Branded Cards portfolio, up about 3%. The consumer has - we've seen a shift towards essentials and away from travel and entertainment. There's certainly a general performance that's consistent with what we've expected when we look at delinquencies, when we look at the loss rates that played to through the quarter, there are no surprises there as we think about that.",Analyst,CFO,2025,Citigroup,Q1_2025,1,0.891,1_the_you_and_that,Macroeconomic Risk,Macroeconomic Risk,2025-03-31,Q1_2025,Macro Risk,Positive
"Thank you. Hi Mark, I wanted to ask you about capital optimization levers that you have to you've done, made some good progress in Risk-Weighted Assets mitigation. Is there still some room to go there. And then also, could you maybe increase the pace of Deferred Tax Assets utilization to reduce the Tangible Common Equity density in a way to help the Return on Average Tangible Common Equity goal.","Yes, sure. So, look, we're always looking at opportunities to further optimize the use of capital. In Markets we've talked about last year a lot about the revenue to Risk-Weighted Assets as a tool that we've been using there. That's continued to increase that metric and ratio. We continue to look at, are we optimizing balance sheet and getting the broader revenue streams we'd expect from our client base, when we do our corporate lending work and some of that is showing up in how we've now introduced the revenue sharing as a tool to ensure we're capturing broader revenues from clients when we are using balance sheet.

But I believe you're still intact with your charge-off guides for the year. I think just noticing Retail Services was, I think, expectedly higher than high end at 6.43%. Can you just remind us again how you're expecting the cadence of credit card losses to trajected for both Branded Cards and Retail Services as you go forward? Thanks.","Sure. Again, we do obviously feel that we are well reserved here. We did expect to see a pickup in the first half of the year before trending down in the back half of the year. And so that's kind of the cadence that we'd expect between now and the end of the year. The first half is usually seasonally higher than the back half of the year, and you see that in Retail Services. I would also point out that and you can see it in the deck and I think it's the second page of the appendix but also in the supplement, you are starting to see that delinquency buckets, we show the 90-day plus delinquency bucket starting to trend down in Retail Services, that is also an important indicator in terms of how we look at the expected losses, if you will, in the go forward.

"And I know you indicated that you're looking to keep pace. And I'm wondering, does that mean at $1.75 billion or does that mean keep pace with the increased Q-on-Q, which was $250 million? And so, I know you're laughing, just trying to understand how you're thinking about that, given what we discussed last quarter, which is you have so much opportunity here for buyback and the accretion is so powerful. So, if you don't mind.","Sure. So, look, we're targeting a similar level. As you know, we've been working to bring the Common Equity Tier 1 [Capital ratio] down. We brought it down 20 basis points this quarter. We're still focused on bringing it down to 13.1%. There is uncertainty. The uncertainty is multifaceted. And to some extent, you think about the uncertainty with the SCB. We'll hopefully get some clarity on that as we often do in the summer, and that will inform the pace at which we bring that that down. And then there's the broader market uncertainty, and we want to obviously be there to support clients, and the demand may come on the heels of that. And so, this quarter, like I said, similar level of share repurchases. $20 billion program that we will continue to work through.

"Hi, good afternoon. Just a follow-up question here on the buyback pacing. Your message has been pretty clear about the first half versus the second half. That said, with the stock at $65 versus tangible book at $90, I guess, are you just so scared from the volatility of the SCB result that, that just must be hurdle before you can accelerate the buyback? And Mark, perhaps if you could sort of dispel some of the notion that sometimes happens in some of these chats with buy-siders about your inability to dividend from the bank sub to the holding company in order to increase your buybacks over the near term. If you could address that, too, that would be great.","Yes, sure. So, look, we have accelerated the pace of buybacks. And I think this quarter is a good example where I had guided for $1.5 billion, and we kicked it up to $1.75 billion. And I think you should expect that as we see opportunities to continue to do that, then we're going to do it.

"Got it. And just my second question. Mark, you mentioned the four cuts that's now embedded in your Net Interest Income outlook, I'm guessing that's for the U.S. How should we think about how you're thinking of global rates? Obviously, it's a basket of countries and currencies that we have to think about. And if your top exposures are exposed to lower rates, how should we think about deposit spreads in Services from here?","I think I'd say, I guess the easiest way to answer the question is to point to the IRE analysis that we show on a quarterly basis. And there are a lot of - that's obviously a risk measure. There are a lot of limitations associated with taking it too deeply or taking it too literally, but as you know, it is a view on how lower rates could impact Citi over a 12-month period. It assumes a static balance sheet, no growth, no change in composition or mix or changes in our hedging actions. And it is an instantaneous shock to the entire curve. With that said, we do break out the impact for U.S. dollar versus non-U.S. dollar. Remember, as you just referenced, there are over 60 currencies, but that asset sensitivity would suggest with a - in the fourth quarter - with a 100-basis point move across the currencies that the non-U.S. dollar impact would be $1 billion over a 12-month period. And so that take that with a grain of salt, but that gives you some sense as to the sensitivity to rates, that would assume all of those currencies and rates in those countries moved at the same time across the curve, and we did nothing to actively manage or dynamically manage the balance sheet.",Analyst,CFO,2025,Citigroup,Q1_2025,1,-0.4576,1_the_you_and_that,Interest Rate Risk,Interest Rate Risk,2025-03-31,Q1_2025,Market Risk,Negative

Is there any sort of internal limits that you follow, what would be the implications of that from a funding cost standpoint?","Yes. Look, we have internal limits.

We haven't seen any shifts of business away from us. And just remember the nature of our business. These are many of these markets around the world we've been in for over a century.

Was there any types of strategies that you guys employed? Because when you go back in other seasonal periods, first quarter of prior years, we've not seen this kind of growth. So, what led to this kind of success of growing your trading assets so well this quarter?","Yes. Again, it's the growth you've seen across the platform in both fixed income as well as equities and so that equities growth of 23% strong performance in derivatives in prime and prime balance growth tied to that particularly with hedge funds and asset managers as they looked at regional reallocation, strong contribution there. And then, rates and currencies, good increased client activity in portfolio trading. And then, we saw a lot of good spread product momentum driven by higher client activity and loan growth. And so, the nature of the activity, the structure of the products and what have you were all contributing factors there. Really strong performance across the business.

We did come in at $13.4 [billion] in the quarter. I kind of went through the puts and takes around that. I'd expect probably a bit of a tick up in Q2 when I think about the things in front of us and some of the continued investments that we plan to make in transformation and some of the other things underneath that, like data and regulatory reporting. And then I'd expect it to trend down so that we get to the target of the $53.4 [billion] that I referenced for the full year.

We've got the franchise very focused around net new investment assets, bringing those in from the $5 trillion of assets that are off us with existing clients, as well as new wealth that that is being created and new clients we're bringing to the franchise. And so, I'm very pleased as well with the caliber of the team that he has brought to bear here. We've got real horsepower and firepower in our investment capabilities.

They're looking to us for a global perspective, the capabilities we've got on the ground all around the globe and helping put them into good position amidst the uncertainty.

Are there other blocks of business that are in motion right now?","Thanks Glenn and good morning, and thanks for the question. Look, a couple of points on that. One is we've been very focused on the revenue to Risk-Weighted Assets metric in our Markets business in the ICG more broadly as well. And we've made considerable progress on that.

"I appreciate that, Mark. Maybe just a quick follow-up. On Net Interest Income, I asked this last quarter too. And your first half annualized ex-Markets is running about $1.5 billion ahead of the guide. Is that just unpredictable nature all the moving parts, trying to be conservative or anything else in the back half that you're thinking about?","Thanks, Glenn. We did take guidance up to slightly above $46 billion from the $45 billion. I guess there are a couple of things, and that’s ex-Markets, of course. There are a couple of things to think about in terms of headwinds and tailwinds that play through there. One is you've heard me mention before that we've reached terminal betas in the U.S. Two, deposit volumes and the shift mix as we see consumers kind of move into higher-returning type, higher-yielding type products. And three, really the wind-downs and the exits and the reduction that they will play out in terms of Net Interest Income. So those are kind of 3 headwinds as we think about the forecast and the balance of year. There are obviously some potential tailwinds that play to the other side, including rate movements in non-U.S. dollar as well as Card volume growth. And as we look at those headwinds and tailwinds, our current read is to take it up, but $46 billion or slightly above that feels like the right level in the context of total revenues at $78 billion to $79 billion.",Analyst,CFO,2023,Citigroup,Q2_2023,1,0.8968,1_the_you_and_that,Liquidity Risk,Liquidity Risk,2023-06-30,Q2_2023,Liquidity Risk,Positive

Is it a year-over-year kind of a discussion? I just want to make sure I understand the whole bend the curve notion and how to think about that.","Thank you. Let me take that. I'd say a couple of things. So, one, I'd reiterate the expense guidance that we've given for the full year. So that's the roughly $54 billion ex-divestitures, or the impact of divestitures, ex-any impact from Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation special assessment. Two, as we think about bending the curve, I look into 2024 and we're looking to bring the absolute expense dollars down from Q3 to Q4. So that bending of the curve will occur.

Is there an absolute expense decline story in the core business? Or is that more that you need the top line growth to get the improved returns?","Again, it's going to be a combination of continuing to bend the curve and bring our expenses down.

Look, I think as we mentioned, Wealth was down about 5%. It's really hard to talk the rebound in Wealth in the midst of such an uncertain environment and the one that we're in, it's hard to disconnect those macro factors like rates, inflation, the prospect of a recession from what we're seeing in Wealth. And I think there are two dynamics that have played out. One has been the shift from our customers, from customers more broadly into higher-yielding products from out of deposits. And the other has been the fee revenue from an investment management fee point of view, and as you might think about it, it is a higher rate environment.

Our current reserves are based on the mix of those 3 macroeconomic scenarios.

So it's not just ‘ 25, just to be clear. And we do continue to feel very confident around our ability to do that. You heard us mention the levers that we think will contribute to that.

So, you're not hearing any alarm bells ringing from Mark or myself at all here on the U.S. consumer, I think we see the U.S. consumer as resilient, we've talked about them being cautious but they're not recessionary. And we are seeing more pressure on the lower FICOs. We don't have a large number of that in our portfolio, but that is where we're seeing more of the normalization happening on the payment rates, for example, and other behaviors in there.

And when you look at it going forward, do you think changes are coming because the Fed if they end in Fed funds rate increase as we get to a terminal rate, how are you guys positioned the balance sheet, do you think going forward?","Look, we're constantly actively managing the balance sheet in light of not only our client needs, but also how we see the broader macro environment evolving and changing. And as you know, and I know you've seen and we've talked about before, we share in our Qs, our view on our estimate for interest rate exposure and what happens with 100 basis points swing in rates in one direction or another across the curve across currencies.

Are those numbers correct? How would you put those numbers? And in terms of bending the cost curve, where are you further along and where are you just getting started?","Well, Mike, you know I love you, but I'm not going to play that game.

We haven't gotten into specific costs; you know it's in the total number. But what I would say again is that we're clear on what we've got to deliver and execute against and we're managing that cost very tightly. We're constantly looking at opportunities to deliver on those transformation deliverables, more efficiently, leveraging technology, leveraging Artificial Intelligence in some instances.

What I would say in terms of the Markets Net Interest Income is, you've captured it right, which is the dynamic that's playing out between first quarter and second quarter is, in fact, dividend season.

Or are you going to try and keep that closer to the 13.3%?","I think we're going to see exactly what the framework is that comes out and then the implementation time frame for it and then look at making adjustments to plan, also hoping that the comment period is taken seriously and the different considerations I talked about earlier are taken into effect. Then we'll work through what are adjustments we make, pricing capital reallocation, etc., the playbook that you would expect the same one that we've done with SA-CCR and we've done with a number of other pieces. And we would also hope to see our SCB in a different place for the same reasons we talked about earlier Vivek, because there's a lot of volatility in that SCB dependent on the scenario that comes out every year.

"Completely unrelated, if I may. Noninterest-bearing deposits, what are you seeing given you're very heavily corporate driven. When I look at your point-to-point because you don't give a full average balance sheet, it's only interest-bearing related. But the noninterest-bearing is only available on a period end. If I look at that, there was a big drop in the U.S. this quarter. Anything unusual? Is that accelerating? What are you seeing amongst your clients, people still waking up? And what have you factored into your Net Interest Income guidance for that?","Well, again, I think the point I'd make here is that we continue to see clients shift from kind of noninterest-bearing deposits and into both interest-bearing and CDs and other higher-yielding products in light of the rate environment that we're in. And I would expect us to continue to see those types of shifts subject to how rates continue to evolve. And again, on the corporate side, we've seen in the U.S. clients have reached kind of those terminal, that terminal level, terminal betas, I should say, outside of the U.S. rate hikes, I think, are still in the future, as Jane alluded to, and the terminal betas have not quite yet been reached.

That's a few different parts to that, so let's start by just taking a step back. Our transformation is addressing decades of under-investment in large parts of Citi's infrastructure and in our risk and control environment. And when you unpack that, those areas where we had an absence of enforced enterprise-wide standards and governance, we've had a siloed organization that's prevented scale, a culture where a lot of groups were allowed to solve problem – the same problem in different ways, fragmented tech platforms, manual processes and controls, and a weak first line of defense, too few subject matter experts. So, this is a massive body of work that goes well beyond the consent order and this is not old Citi putting in Band-Aids. This is Citi tackling the root issues head on.

"Hi. Thank you. So, Mark, I heard your comments on credit this year. I'm talking the US Personal Banking. I heard your comments for credit the rest of this year and I think in a position that you're very conservatively reserved. But right now, you put up a 3% margin and credit costs are almost half of what revenues are in this space. I guess, my question is this: As we roll forward, in a slowing economy with likely a little bit lower – some rate cuts, how does the P&L evolve? How does it improve from here? Because can we be expecting credit costs to come in, in a slowing economy? I'm just trying to figure out the path forward because it could be impactful if U.S. Personal Banking obviously marches to where you need it to be.","Yeah, look, like I said, we do think that there is certainly upside to U.S. Personal Banking. We're looking for that upside in the medium-term targets that we've set for ourselves. You've got to remember that when you look at the quarter and you look at the half, frankly, that we're still in a period where we're seeing the normalization of the cost of credit. And as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, you have kind of a compounding effect of multiple vintages now maturing at the same time that's playing through the P&L. That's not just true for us, that's true for others as well. And so we'd expect and we are – we do believe we're seeing some signs of a cresting when you look at delinquencies now and so we would expect that those losses start to normalize and loss rates start to come down as we go towards the medium term.",Analyst,CFO,2024,Citigroup,Q2_2024,1,0.5908,1_the_you_and_that,Profitability,Profitability,2024-06-30,Q2_2024,Other,Positive

There's been plenty of conversation about pull forward this year on just refi driving like three-quarters of the activity. Could you just help us think through the second half when thinking about Debt Capital Markets just to make sure that we don't like start modelling this into perpetuity?,"Look, I think when we think about the back half of 2024, we're going to see a different mix of activity in Banking. We do still expect demand to be quite strong across our capital market products because you've got a wall of maturing debt securities coming up in the second half that carry on for a couple of years. But, we did see some clients accelerating issuances into the first half getting ahead of potential market volatility.

"Hey. Good morning. Just, Mark, maybe on Net Interest Income, down almost 4% year-over-year. Seems a little bit more than the guidance was down modestly for the year. So, can you discuss sort of the puts and takes this quarter and how we should think about the quarterly trajectory for the rest of the year?","Yeah. So, I'd say a couple things. So, one, as I mentioned, in the quarter and you see it on slide 9, ex-Markets, we're down about 3%. That's largely driven by some Foreign Exchange translation that played through, but also some seasonally lower revolving card balances and then lower interest rates in Argentina. And what that is in Argentina, we have capital there, the policy rate was adjusted downward and as that happened, we obviously earned less on that capital that flows through the Net Interest Income line.",Analyst,CFO,2024,Citigroup,Q2_2024,1,0.6908,1_the_you_and_that,Profitability,Profitability,2024-06-30,Q2_2024,Other,Positive
"That's helpful. And maybe just quickly, kind of a similar question on expenses. Better-than-expected this quarter, but there was no restructuring or repositioning charges. I think to get to the high end of your range, you'd have to be up a little bit in the back half from 2Q run rate. Is that because you expect more repositioning, restructuring in the second half or maybe just talk through expense trajectory from here?","Yeah, so that's right. When I talk about it at the first quarter, I talked about kind of a downward trend for each of the quarters after Q1. The second quarter came in a bit lower than we were expecting. I'm sticking with the guidance and it does mean that the back half of the year will likely come in – will come in higher than the second quarter. That's a combination of a couple of things, including the pace of hiring and investment that we will do in the transformation work that has to be done. It also includes repositioning charges that we might take or need to take as we continue to work through our businesses across the firm and the franchise and then the second quarter did or – yeah, the second quarter did have a one-time or so and some delayed spending that will pick up in the third and fourth quarter around advertising and marketing and some of the other line items.

"Hi. I had two questions and I'll ask the first one on expenses first since it's a good follow-up to the previous. Mark, just to clarify. Let's just say, take the highest end of your range at $53.8 billion. Just trying to think about how consensus will move. So, we take that $53.8 billion and then add the $285 million of Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation expenses year-to-date so far and add the civil money penalties of $136 million, so that gets us to $54.2 billion for the year and any other repositioning charges in the second half of the year would already be included in the $53.8 billion?","So, yes. The answer to the last part of your question is yes. So in the range that I've given, $53.5 billion to $53.8 billion, that includes our estimate for the full year of repositioning and any restructuring charges. That range excludes the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Special Assessment that we saw earlier in the year and it excludes the CMP of $136 million.",Analyst,CFO,2024,Citigroup,Q2_2024,1,0.764,1_the_you_and_that,Liquidity Risk,Liquidity Risk,2024-06-30,Q2_2024,Liquidity Risk,Positive
"Got it. And my second question is for Jane and I'm sure you're getting tired of the question on capital return. So, you're buying back $1 billion, you plan to buy back $1 billion this quarter. It looks like you didn't buy back any in the second quarter. And I'm asking this question in this context because consensus has a buyback of nearly $1 billion in the fourth quarter and staying at this rate for the first half of next year and ramping higher. And I guess, is the $1 billion number a catch-up pace because you didn't buy back any in the second quarter? And I fully appreciate that you also have the Banamex IPO coming, which is different from peers that are also waiting for Basel clarification. But I'm just wondering, do we need to wait for that Banamex IPO for the company to feel comfortable moving away from that quarter-to-quarter guidance? And also, of course, I just want to readdress the beginning of the question when I asked specifically about the pace.","Okay. So, we are not going to be giving guidance going forward around our buybacks. We are going to continue to give quarterly and make it a quarterly determination as to the level. And a lot of that is to do with the uncertainty about the forthcoming regulatory changes. I think we were delighted to see a slight reduction in our Stress Capital Buffer, reflecting the financial strength and resiliency of our business model and also good to see the benefits of our strategy playing out.

Do you guys have any color on that as well?","Yeah, so, on the first part of the question, look, we all kind of have talked about in the past, the prospect of Fair Isaacson Company inflation back during the COVID period of time. We've been very focused on ensuring that acquisitions that we've made have been appropriately kind of analyzed in the underwriting of that to get comfortable with the quality of new customers that we've been bringing on.

Can you just help us understand a little bit of like just generally how you're thinking through that discrepancy and how that informs the difference between US-related Net Interest Income and non-US-related Net Interest Income as you go forward?","Yeah, thank you. So look, I think that as we look at it, out through the – certainly through the medium term, we expect to see continued Net Interest Income growth at obviously a modest level, certainly lower than what we've seen historically and that's in large part because or in part I should say because of how we've been managing the balance sheet and that has allowed for us to reinvest as securities have rolled off and earn a higher yield on them relative to what we were earning, in some instances, they were five-year terms on some of these investments.

"Hi good afternoon. So, I know we talked a lot about expenses. I just have one kind of overarching question here, which is on how we should think about the path of expenses between now and the medium term, as we have come quite a long way in the simplification process. Maybe if you could give us a sense as to how far along simplification impact on expenses we are? And overlapping with the regulatory requirements, do these net out or are we skewed a little bit more towards regulatory requirements being a bit heavier than what's left on simplification from here? Thanks.","So, thank you, Betsy. I guess I'd say a couple things. So, I think we said it in the past. So, the target for the medium term, we think 2026 is somewhere around $51 billion to $53 billion of expenses. As we've said, we'll have about $1.5 billion in savings related to the restructuring that we've done and another $500 million to $1 billion related to net expense reductions from eliminating the stranded costs as well as additional productivity over that medium-term period. And so, we've made, I think, very good headway, as Jane has mentioned, in the org simplification and the restructuring charges associated with that. Those saves will have started to generate. Some of those saves in the early part of that, meaning this year, will likely be offset by continued investment that we're making in areas of the business like transformation, but also in business-led or driven growth. And you should expect in terms of the trend that we would have a downward trend towards 2026 in achieving that range.",Analyst,CFO,2024,Citigroup,Q2_2024,1,0.7988,1_the_you_and_that,Strategic and Business Model Risk,Strategic and Business Model Risk,2024-06-30,Q2_2024,Business Model Risk,Positive

Am I right there?","No, you're not right. So, I think as you've heard us talk about, Vivek, for a while now, that we knew the areas that we were behind in elements of our transformation program and that we began addressing those and making the investments. Some of that's in people. Some of that is in technology spend.

You're a scale player, you're above sort of pre-pandemic levels, but not – I don't know if I, it doesn't seem like it's that much higher by a dramatic amount.

"Thank you, both, for that color. Maybe just a quick follow-up just on the Retail Services business. We are seeing some evidence that your competitors in this space have been more aggressive leading with price in an effort to win some new mandates. And was hoping you could just speak to what you're seeing across the competitor set and your appetite or willingness to potentially offer better economics in response to increased competition from some of your peers.","I think you'll be delighted to hear that we're very focused on returns rather than just on revenues. So, when we enter into discussions with a partner who may be a new RFP for their portfolio or looking at new ones such as the one we just agreed with Dillard's, it's all about the returns and the profile of the business rather than the revenue side of things.

"Hi. Just two clarifications. So, this is a very high-profile amendment to the consent order. And I think what I hear you saying that if you can confirm, your risk compliance and controls are getting passing grade. It's really the data and as it relates to the data, you're talking about 11,000 regulatory reports, some which had 750,000 lines of data. Is that really the scope of what you need to fix? Because people see this externally and say, hey, you're failing in terms of overall controls and resiliency. But I think I hear you saying it's really more about just the data and the regulatory reporting, which is important, but more of a slice of a broader picture. Is that correct?","Yeah, Mike, maybe I just – maybe I – you're asking a great and it's an important question, so maybe I try and explain what the data elements because it's an area that Mark and I have pointed to. So, first of all, we use data all over the firm. We use it to deliver 72 million customer statements every month. Our corporate clients, as you heard about at our Services Investor Day, access account data real-time across multiple countries on CitiDirect. And we're moving $5 trillion roughly per day for those clients around the world. We trade billions of dollars in a millisecond on our trading platforms. We can see our liquidity positions real-time around the world.

"Yeah, just to say real short follow-up to that. So you're doing all this great stuff, but you still fell short, just in like one sentence, despite doing all of this great stuff that you described, the regulator still said you didn't get it done. Why, after doing all that, didn't you get it done in the eyes of the regulators and why will it be fixed now? Just like a one sentence explanation for that if you have it.","I always said that a transformation of this magnitude over multiple years would not be linear. We have many steps forward.

"Hi. Jane, you spoke more about the restructuring that you commented on recently. The real question is, why is this restructuring different than the other 5 or 10 or 15 restructurings we've heard about since Citi's creation in its current form 25 years ago, I think, just like a week ago? So, I'd say, why is this different? We hear the talk about cascading downward and the simplification, reducing dual heads and the committees. But we've heard this so much that why is this time different?","Yeah. It's a very important question, Mike, thank you for asking it. As I've said, we view these as the most consequential changes we've made, not just to our organization model, but how we run the bank, in almost two decades. And the first piece is simple, which is our org model was set up for a financial supermarket, that is simply not the bank we are today.

"So, I'm curious, you mentioned that you're still marching towards the 11%, 12%, which is good because everyone was going to ask that. My question is a little bit different of, with the denominator going up 25%, in other words, a lot of things are working towards your Transformation, but there's sort of a curve ball in there with upping the denominator by 25%. So, you seem to be a beneficiary of higher for longer for sure. And you also mentioned you're working on mitigation as we speak. So, maybe you could talk about what are the offsets that we don't see that give you confidence still working towards that, because the top line stuff is working?","So, good morning, Glenn, it's good to hear from you. Let me make a couple comments on that, and then, Jane, feel free to chime in if you'd like. The first thing is that when I talked about this at the last conference we attended, I mentioned that analysts were somewhere in the 16% to 19% range in terms of a capital increase, and we're likely to be inside of that range, assuming the Basel III proposal as it’ s structured, as it's written, and obviously that's not the final, there's a period of review that's going on now.",Analyst,CFO,2023,Citigroup,Q3_2023,1,0.9258,1_the_you_and_that,Interest Rate Risk,Interest Rate Risk,2023-09-30,Q3_2023,Market Risk,Positive
"Good morning. You've talked a lot about defense, as I like to call it, in terms of the Transformation that Jane had outlined and bending the expense curve. But I'm wondering, for both Jane and Mark, if you could sort of address what I think is probably the most debated part of your target, which is that revenue Compound Annual Growth Rate of 5%. You put up a very nice quarter in terms of revenues, both net interest income and fees. And maybe help us sort of look underneath the surface in terms of that momentum and maybe break it down in terms of what's really going well. I think Treasury and Trade Solutions continues to surprise to the upside, are we going to be, two years from now, we’ re going to be like, oh, well, Treasury and Trade Solutions is continuing to be doing well. So, what are the businesses that really sort of strong secular momentum that you feel is being under-recognized versus how you could position cyclically and higher for longer? And what is still to come as we think about that path to at least the numerator of that Return on Average Tangible Common Equity target?","I love this question, Erika, because I have to say I’ m really excited about our strategy and the potential it has.

"Hey good morning. Mark, maybe on the revenue discussion there, let's talk about Net Interest Income a little bit. You guys have a very unique deposit base, a lot smaller footprint in low-cost consumer. Betas have been, already been high, so it doesn't seem like there's as much beta catch-up risk for you. It's 50% non-US roughly. How do you think about the trajectory of Net Interest Income, do you think it stabilizes next year before rate cuts? How do we think about the puts and takes on your Net Interest Income into next year?","Yeah, thanks for the question. Look. I'm not going to give guidance for 2024, we'll do that obviously at the fourth quarter 2023 earnings. But I think it's reasonable to expect that some of the trends that we've seen so far will continue. So, if you think about what's underneath this, we'll continue to benefit from higher rates across currencies. I think we'll continue to see benefits from card interest-earning balance growth.",Analyst,CFO,2023,Citigroup,Q3_2023,1,0.9239,1_the_you_and_that,Liquidity Risk,Liquidity Risk,2023-09-30,Q3_2023,Liquidity Risk,Positive
"Hey good morning. On the capital markets side, I heard the comments around it being hard to predict when deal activity will sustainably rebound. Can you just give us an update or more color on how CEOs are thinking about bringing deals live across Mergers & Acquisitions, Equity Capital Markets and Debt Capital Markets? And does the market and rate volatility over the last few weeks have any significant impact on bringing deals to completion or on the pipeline?","Well, I think a couple pieces. I actually start with Q3 is the seventh quarter of the current Investment Banking Return on Average Tangible Common Equity: Return on Average Tangible downturn. So, since 2000, downturns have tended not to last longer than seven quarters because that's often how long it takes for pricing expectations to fully adjust to new realities. And we're starting to see that particularly in the debt capital markets, investment grade markets, where the expectation of no longer how high, but how long for rates, we've seen clients who get off the sidelines and just bite the bullet and get into the debt capital markets in a more meaningful way and no longer waiting on that.",Analyst,CEO,2023,Citigroup,Q3_2023,1,-0.6108,1_the_you_and_that,Macroeconomic Risk,Macroeconomic Risk,2023-09-30,Q3_2023,Macro Risk,Negative
"Hi good morning. So, Mark and Jane, I do recognize you'll provide a more fulsome update on expense actions next quarter, but one of the things I was hoping was that you could frame the expense opportunity in the context of your headcount trends. And prior to COVID, as well as the consent order, mind you, Citi was running with 200,000 direct staff. That number is closer to 240,000 today. It's an increase of 20%, even with multiple divestitures that you've consummated. So how should we think about an appropriate target or an optimal level of headcount for Citi versus that pre-COVID baseline of 200,000, and whether the consent order would impact the timing or magnitude of such headcount actions?","So, look, I'm not going to give you headcount guidance, but what I will say is Jane has talked before about the heads associated with the divestitures that are underway. And obviously as we continue to progress in those divestitures, we've made a lot of progress already, we'll see those heads come down. It's also important to point out that as part of our effort, there's been in-sourcing.

"Hi. There were some quotes, I think, in the media, Jane, from you talking about some signs of pressure among the lower end of the consumer, and I appreciate the pie chart that you have in the deck showing it's not a huge percent of the card portfolio. But could you elaborate on that? And then also just address the, you mentioned directionally how the payment rates in cards are coming down, but if we look at the growth in spend versus the growth in loans, it is kind of a little disproportionate. I think spend is up a couple percent year-over-year, and the loans are 11%. So, as we think about being kind of later-cycle, is that something that you're paying attention to as a potential sign of further weakness in credit?","Yeah. Look, I think most of the pressure in the lower Fair Isaacson Company, we don't have a lot of customers in lower Fair Isaacson Company, so, we're seeing it out in the market. We've got, we obviously have some in the Retail Services business, we also, I would say, have the benefit of that loss sharing agreement that really makes a difference there because we're having to reserve fully for that, but we get it back on the revenue line, as you know.",Analyst,CEO,2023,Citigroup,Q3_2023,1,0.5136,1_the_you_and_that,Asset Quality and Credit Risk,Asset Quality and Credit Risk,2023-09-30,Q3_2023,Credit Risk,Positive
"Good morning, Jane and good morning Mark. Jane, as you pointed out, you're very excited about the opportunities in Treasury and Trade Solutions. You're winning some new mandates in the custody business. Can you feel is it because the competition is struggling with other issues? What gives you, because Citi has always been well-regarded in this area, so what gives you that added excitement that this is even getting better?","Look, I think the added excitement is, a lot of it's coming from the investments that we've been making. So that we are, if you look at it in terms of Payment Express, which is live in the U.S., Thailand, it’s on track for three more markets, that is really a very differentiating capability.",Analyst,CEO,2023,Citigroup,Q3_2023,1,0.4939,1_the_you_and_that,Regulatory & Compliance Risk,Regulatory & Compliance Risk,2023-09-30,Q3_2023,Regulatory Risk,Positive
"Hi Jane. Hi Mark. Want to just clarify the reorganization a little bit. So, Jane, I heard you say that you're keeping North Asia and South Asia heads. So, did you just get rid of the Asia head and get rid of the product heads, where product heads in each country were reporting to a regional product head? So, is that that dotted line is no longer there or what's going on there? And when you get rid of all the monthly management reporting, what are you planning to replace that with from your management, your MIS perspective?","So, let me take the second one first. I'm not planning on replacing it with anything. We don't need them. We're no longer running consumer franchises in the countries. Instead, we've got global businesses that are operating very consistently in the individual geographies, so we just don't need to replace them. And it enables us just to have the legal entity, financial management that we need. And then our internal reports get greatly simplified. Same as they get greatly simplified by taking out ICG and PBWM is another, eliminating that layer also eliminates a lot of different reports. So, the wonderful answer is, nothing, a simpler Citi.",Analyst,CEO,2023,Citigroup,Q3_2023,1,0.507,1_the_you_and_that,Strategic and Business Model Risk,Strategic and Business Model Risk,2023-09-30,Q3_2023,Business Model Risk,Positive
"And not only that, but we’re talking about this in an environment where we still have pretty extraordinary labor markets. So, if you could just give us a little bit more color on just your expectations on credit losses and whether there's maybe a little bit more risk than we're thinking in terms of losses trending to something that is a bit higher than what we normally, or what are more normalized levels?","Yes. So, let me start on that, and then, Jane, if you want to chime in, that's fine. I think what I'd point you to is page 24 in the deck that we have because it gives you a nice snapshot of how both the loss rates have been trending but also how the delinquencies have been trending. And you can see that the delinquencies have been trending up, and that kind of gives us a good indication of where loss rates are likely to trend in the next quarter or so.",Analyst,CFO,2023,Citigroup,Q3_2023,1,0.5499,1_the_you_and_that,Asset Quality and Credit Risk,Asset Quality and Credit Risk,2023-09-30,Q3_2023,Credit Risk,Positive
"Hi, thanks for the follow-up. From your initial answer, Jane, I hear you with the restructuring, deconstructing Citi to global lines, delayering of management, and de-cluttering reporting. And when you add it all together, we'll get some numbers in January. But as it relates to your return targets and efficiency targets for 2025 and 2026, consensus is about one-third below what you target. And frankly, I have not spoken to one investor who thinks you're going to get those targets and maybe you would want to revise those lower in some way or maybe to be determined. Or what's your degree of conviction of getting to those targets or at least getting above your cost of capital?","Yeah, look, we remain confident around our ability to hit these targets. We've got, you heard me talk earlier around the revenue growth and what are some of the tailwinds that we've got behind us as well as the core strategy and the drivers that we're in control of and that we've been investing behind to achieve. So, our strategy is unchanged, we're confident it will drive the revenue growth of 4% to 5%.

I was just curious on the corporate loans in North America there was an uptick. Again, I know relative to the portfolio, it's not that big. But anything in particular you can share with us in that area?","On the corporate loans, we saw loss, I think losses were $51 million in the quarter, so a small amount. We did see an uptick, as you point out, in the reserves. That was really driven by some country rating adjustments that were made. And then we did see an increase in the NALs, the non-accrual loans. And that was really one or two names and one in North America, one in EMEA. Both of them are current.

"Good morning. I guess maybe, Mark, for you, like looking at slide 7 on Net Interest Income, and maybe we can break it down into Markets and ex-Markets. In the ex-Markets Net Interest Income, $11.96 billion this quarter, based on what you've said, the back book repricing, deposit flex, is it safe to conclude that the ex-Markets Net Interest Income bottomed in 2Q 2024? And I noticed the securities yield actually went lower, 7 Basis Points quarter-over-quarter. So was there something one-off that impacted the yield this quarter relative to the expectations you outlined earlier?","So when you look at slide 7, you got a couple of things playing through. So your point around the low number, the low print, $11.46 billion in the second quarter, that really is a combination relative to first quarter of Foreign Exchange translation, some seasonally lower card balances, and lower interest payments in Argentina playing through that sequential 1Q to 2Q.",Analyst,CFO,2024,Citigroup,Q3_2024,1,-0.1779,1_the_you_and_that,Liquidity Risk,Liquidity Risk,2024-09-30,Q3_2024,Liquidity Risk,Neutral

I think I heard Jane say that momentum should continue.

But consensus has you not hitting your revenue growth targets and you're certainly free to disagree and I think that's fine. But they also have your expenses at the high end of your $51 billion to $53 billion range in 2026. I guess, does that make sense or do you feel confident that if revenues do sort of disappoint your targets that you could come in at the – you should or can come in at the lower end of that range to help get to your Return on Average Tangible Common Equity target.","Yeah.

And this question is not really the same question I ask you about buybacks every quarter but really maybe a progress update on Banamex. So there is chatter in the market about Banamex needed to have four quarters of separate financials before being IPOed and I'm wondering if you could give us specific progress on how that's going? And Mark, maybe remind us on what Banamex's contribution is as we think about the unlocking that excess capital versus taking it out of the P&L.","Yeah. I'd be delighted to, Erika.

Hey. Thanks for taking my question. I have one for Mark. So you mentioned that Services Net Interest Income is a tailwind as rates decline. Can you just unpack how that happens? Is there any benefit from swap roll-off or a floating swap that we should be thinking about that's embedded in that statement?,"There are a couple of things kind of to keep in mind on the Services business. So, one is, is obviously this is a client business. It's not just a deposit taking business and so how we think about pricing to those client becomes really important.",Analyst,CFO,2024,Citigroup,Q3_2024,1,0.2716,1_the_you_and_that,Profitability,Profitability,2024-09-30,Q3_2024,Other,Positive
"Okay. Fair enough. And then I guess a follow-up on the US Personal Banking, Return on Average Tangible Common Equity improvement and the normalization of the cost of credit seems to be a big component of that. But Mark can you just remind us where you are in terms of cost of credit versus what you would think a more normalized level is for Branded Cards and Retail Services. I guess how much of a tailwind does a more normalized credit environment entail in terms of credit cost?","Again, I don't want to get into 2025 at this stage.

"Hi. I looked in detail at the earnings presentation, especially slide 4, and I think the question is, on many people's minds, I count 12 restructurings at Citigroup. And I count 12 restructurings that have failed at Citigroup. You might disagree with the number 12, It could be 5, it could be 8, it could be 12, it could be more, but I've not spoken to one person of any investor who would say that Citi has succeeded on its prior restructuring. So, the question is, why is this time different? Number one, who is this new and improved Citigroup. Number two, why aren't expenses down even move, especially when few people that I talk to think you'll hit your revenue target? And three, Jane, what is your conviction level of getting to that 11% to 12% Return on Average Tangible Common Equity in 2025 or 2026? Thank you.","Well, thank you very much indeed, Mike. I'll start with, who is Citi? Citi is, I'm delighted to say, finally simple. At Investor Day, I set out a vision to be the preeminent banking partner for clients with cross border needs.

"Hi. Thanks very much. So, you're clearly making a lot of progress and I hate to like, ask this question too early, but I think it is important. Your expense guidance is good, your revenue guide is good, and you have your arms around the expenses. The question I have is, how do you think about balancing that near-term profitability improvement that we all want desperately with making sure you do make the right investments? Because if you look around the world there's a lot of places to grow, whether it be a branch network, or the wealth management aspirations that you have, or the digital investments. So, how do we know that all the right future investments are being made while you extract costs in all the good ways that you've been doing?","Yeah, thanks, Glenn. I guess, I'll start, and Jane, feel free to add in on it. Look, it is a balancing act, right, and we do look at each of our five core businesses. We obviously are clear on the strategy, but where's the growth? Where are the return opportunities associated with them? And how do we ensure we're deploying resources after them in order to deliver for the client and deliver on those returns over time? We have to juxtapose that against the required investment to modernize our operations and we're making those trade-offs on a regular basis. But importantly, when we do invest to capture those growth opportunities, we're trying to be agile about it, which means if those opportunities don't play out in the way we're expecting because the cycle just doesn't mature or materialize in that fashion, we've got to be disciplined enough to dial them back, and that's what you've seen over the past year plus, is that we've been investing in the business.",Analyst,CFO,2024,Citigroup,Q4_2023,1,0.9746,1_the_you_and_that,Profitability,Profitability,2023-12-31,Q4_2023,Other,Positive

"Hi good morning. Mark, was hoping to ask you, how are you thinking about the pacing of capital build? Obviously, the Basel III proposals are out there, but they could change, of course. Even if they don't change, you have a couple of years to leg into those with the phase-ins and perhaps some mitigation opportunities. How should we think about you kind of building capital, given all those variables and the ability to buy back some stock along the way as you mentioned earlier?","Sure, so look, John, obviously the Basel III proposal's still out there and under discussion. We've been very vocal about the potential impact of that. We've also been very disciplined about how we've been managing our capital. We've built that over 30 basis points over the course of the year. You've seen us actively manage that through the year, and we're going to continue to do that.

"Okay. And just as an expense follow-up, I wasn't clear. Has the transformation spend peaked, when you think about what you'll spend on transformation this year versus last year? And are the transformation benefits starting to kick in at this point?","Yeah. So to be clear, we're going to continue to spend whatever we need to spend on the transformation and on risk and controls. And so, we did see a tick up this year. We've got a plan for 2024, and if we've got to spend a bit more than we spent this year, we're going to spend more. That's what the plan calls for, and so that's what we'll do. That's inside of the number that I've given you for guidance, all right. And so, that's important for us.

"Hey, good afternoon. Mark, maybe just to follow up on the expense, slide 22, where you talk about $2 billion to $2.5 billion of expense saves. I guess I'm struggling with the numbers there. I think if you look at exit and wind- down markets, you're probably close to $2 billion in numbers there. And maybe the stranded costs, you can't get all of that out. You're doing about –  severance is $700 million to $1 billion in 2024. So doesn't seem like there's a ton of actual cost saves in that number. And just maybe I'm wrong, if you could just kind of walk me through the numbers embedded in there and if there's, you've kind of eluded to more to come beyond the intermediate term.","Yeah, I think the thing I'd point out to you is a couple things. One, obviously, we're forecasting revenue growth over this period of time.

"Well, that's an important clarification that the $2 billion to $2.5 billion includes revenue-related volume growth, so that's helpful.

How are you thinking, volatility has come in, macro picture’ s getting better, maybe that mutes volatility, how do you think about that business in 2024 as it relates to your guidance?","As you know, it's a tough business to forecast, certainly, for a full year, and in some instances for a quarter, and so, we've basically kind of backed that out but we assume markets kind of flat to modestly down, but we've backed it out, and it's roughly flat.

"Morning, afternoon, Jane. Just wanted to follow up on something I think Mark said at the end of his very first response around, it's very hard in my seat to figure out whether you're going to grow revenues or shrink revenues given the macro. Should we take it based on what you've said today as we look into 2026 getting to that 11% Return on Average Tangible Common Equity, if for whatever reason, revenue falls short and you feel good about the expense flex to mitigate that headwind?","It's Jane, obviously. I want to just jump in on one bit, which is we are committed and we're very confident around the 4% to 5% revenue growth rate, so there isn't any backing away from that number. And that's in various macro environments, et cetera. And as we look across the different businesses, and the projections we have, we're confident around that. Obviously, if there's a very adverse macro environment, et cetera, we've got other levers we can take, but Mark, let me pass it to you.",Analyst,CEO,2024,Citigroup,Q4_2023,1,0.6381,1_the_you_and_that,Liquidity Risk,Liquidity Risk,2023-12-31,Q4_2023,Liquidity Risk,Positive
"Well said. Just what I needed. And one quick question. As we think about rightsizing the Markets business, there have been headlines around the muni and the distressed business that you've gotten out. Is there a risk where the Markets business becomes too small and you lag the scale to be sort of efficient and relevant in certain, or just across the breadth of, be it, fixed income or equities? Just if you can talk about that. Thank you.","The short answer is no. If you think about our Markets business, we have four businesses, each of which are around sort of $4 billion or so in size. You have our global Foreign Exchange network, where we're typically number one in any year, just given the strength, and particularly, the corporate client base we've set off. Rates, typically top three.

"Good afternoon, Mark, Jane. Mark, can you share with us, in your revenue guide, in the net interest income, I know you mentioned it's going to be lower and part of it is due to lower interest rates. Some of your peers have come out with their guides using the forward curve in their net interest income forecast which includes the Fed in our country, six cuts. Can you give us some color what kind of rate environment, I know you said lower rates, but any insights around that guide?","Yeah, I think what I'd point you to is in the range of the $80 billion to $81 billion, we're assuming three to six cuts, right. You've got a range there and the reason I described it like that is that, if you think about our IRE, as we've shown it in the Qs before, we're positioned such that, with 100 basis point move, parallel shift in rate across the curve, the US dollar impact would only be a couple hundred million dollars, all right, and so, to the negative, obviously, but it's a couple hundred million dollars. And so as we think about that forecast, and as I mentioned, Net Interest Income being down a bit, that covers kind of three to six cuts over the course of 2024, likely back-loaded, but that's what's in there.",Analyst,CFO,2024,Citigroup,Q4_2023,1,0.12,1_the_you_and_that,Profitability,Profitability,2023-12-31,Q4_2023,Other,Neutral
"Very good, I appreciate that. And then, Jane, more of a qualitative question rather than quantitative, but obviously, there's numerous moving parts of the strategies that you guys are executing on, exiting businesses, downsizing businesses. Especially on the downsizing, I think you guys mentioned, the head count of about 20,000 coming down. How do you keep the morale of the organization elevated when you have these types of tough decisions that you all have to make?","Yes. Well, we've also got areas which are growing, so that does help, too. We have a diversified portfolio here. I think we're very mindful of, that there is a human impact of the decisions that we're making. We're trying to be as transparent with our people, as we are with our investors about what we need to do, why we're doing it, what to expect and laying that out so people understand the logic behind the decisions, and then they understand what the decisions are as quickly as they can.

"Hi. I'm sorry to prolong the call. Thank you for all your color. Just one more question. Jane, when will you feel comfortable giving us a buyback outlook that's beyond just fourth quarter? I know you still have a little bit of ways to go, but you do have 100 basis point buffer to your minimum. And I know Basel III endgame is still out there, and I'm sure that reducing risk just doesn't mean expenses, but also reducing your – or being mindful of your Risk-Weighted Assets footprint. And given where your stock is relative to book, when will you be more comfortable about giving sort of a longer-term outlook that was underpinning your Return on Average Tangible Common Equity target with regards to the buyback?","Erika, it's a great question. It's one I ask myself every morning when I get up, because given where we trade, the value for our shareholders of buybacks is enormous. And Mark and I are very committed to doing so. We also know that we're building our credibility. And I don't want to say things that we're not going to deliver against, although we're going to have to change.

I think that it was very helpful that you said on this public forum where you're trying to build credibility, because as I think about what long-only investors have been dying to see from Citi in terms of the previous leadership was that sort of awareness.

"Hi. I want to follow up on the Russian exposure on page 34. It looks like you guys have taken a really good whack on the net investment. And you also highlighted how the Cumulative Translation Adjustment would be capital-neutral, even if you did have to write that down. But what about the remaining exposure? And just like how prime –  are you responsible for some of these unremittable corporate derivatives? I think a lot of us don't understand that type of exposure. And is there risk to you going forward, or could you hopefully clear it back from the outside exposure going forward?","Yeah, actually, I also want to kind of take a bigger picture answer to that before I turn it to Mark. Because I would have thought that's a question that is on everybody's minds, particularly given the firm's overall low level of returns and our headline numbers this quarter about what we've been doing with Russia and Argentina, the sort of bigger strategic question behind it, and then we'll get to your specifics on the Russia front.",Analyst,CEO,2024,Citigroup,Q4_2023,1,0.1027,1_the_you_and_that,Capital Adequacy,Capital Adequacy,2023-12-31,Q4_2023,Capital Risk,Neutral

You and a lot of your peers expect losses to go up from here, but most of you are saying, they're going to peak at this year, including you. Just what gives you confidence that the card losses will peak this year is it just getting back to that a little bit of a normalized level? Is it some tightening that you've done? What's driving that confidence, looking out this year? Because you're probably seeing a step-up coming still, right?","Sure ,there's a step-up coming. We gave a forecast on 2024 (sic), as you point out, to what the full-year estimate for Net Credit Losses will be for both Branded and for Retail Services. What I'd point out is, you can see actually on the slide how there was a dip in loss rates during the COVID period. And so to some extent, what we're seeing is kind of a catch up of those, as those portfolios go through a longer maturation than what you'd normally see in a cards portfolio.",Analyst,CFO,2024,Citigroup,Q4_2023,1,-0.0258,1_the_you_and_that,Market and Volatility Risk,Market and Volatility Risk,2023-12-31,Q4_2023,Market Risk,Neutral
"Hi. Thanks for taking my question. So, I have a question on quantitative tightening. Wondering if you have any early thoughts on how Citi's positioned if the Fed ends QT early? Is that a material catalyst for you, and would that help you hit your revenue targets even sooner?","Yeah. Again, I mean, when I think about our interest rate exposure, and for US dollar in particular, we showed it in our last Q, we'll show it in this Q. For a 100 basis point move in a parallel shift, we're looking at probably a negative $1.6 billion or so, but important to point out that the US dollar component of that is only a couple hundred million dollars. Similarly, if rates moved in the other way, positive of 100 basis points, there'd be a small movement as it relates to US dollar exposure. So our US dollar exposure is relatively neutral, again, assuming a static balance sheet, a parallel shift in the curve. And so, we're kind of neutral relative to rates moving in either direction and, therefore, the impact there.",Analyst,CFO,2024,Citigroup,Q4_2023,1,0.8302,1_the_you_and_that,Macroeconomic Risk,Macroeconomic Risk,2023-12-31,Q4_2023,Macro Risk,Positive

Do they hold kind of flattish with a core rate, or would there be any normal course of business growth?","I think what I'd say is that, you should expect it in the first quarter. We'd likely see an uptick in our total expenses relative to the fourth, in part because, as Jane has mentioned, we anticipate that there'll be more to the org simplification and, therefore, dollars associated with that in Q1.

So when I think about that effort, it will close at the end of the first quarter, as we said. We're expecting to get about $1 billion of run rate save from the org simplification work alone. That constitutes about 5,000 heads. We're just about to, at the end of this month, finish Phase 3, which will mean the first four layers of the organization have been addressed. That's been a net reduction of about 1,500 managers out of a total of 12,000 roles.

And how large of a contributor is that to revenues overall at Citigroup?","So, let's see, so obviously, the proposal is out there and we've factored in what's knowable as it relates to that. We haven't given guidance externally on what that impact is, but we do believe there are offsets and mitigants that, over time, we'll be able to kind of bring into play.

I am struggling to reconcile the 50/50 Net Interest Income contribution from rate and volume components, just given average loan to deposits were essentially flat year-on-year, Net Interest Income grew $3 billion. It does imply a much larger contribution from rates. I know there's deposit funds transfer pricing and other noise. So I was hoping maybe you could unpack that a little bit further.","I mean, there are a lot of factors in there.

When you said medium term on this call as it relates to employee reductions, expense savings, revenue targets, and 11% to 12% Return on Average Tangible Common Equity, does medium term mean by 2026 or does it mean something different?",Yeah.,Analyst,CFO,2024,Citigroup,Q4_2023,1,0.296,1_the_you_and_that,Profitability,Profitability,2023-12-31,Q4_2023,Other,Positive
"Hey, good morning everyone. Just I think as Jane noted, it seems like a material driver of the reduction in the Return on Average Tangible Common Equity target in 2026 is expenses. I think you kind of backed off the lower end of that, given higher investments in the Transformation but also talked about it being somewhat temporary. We appreciate the below $53 billion for 2026, but how much more is there to go beyond that in terms of eliminating parallel systems, running parallel systems, reduced consultant spend and all that stuff. Is there still that path to a 60% or lower efficiency ratio? Thanks.","Happy New Year, Jim. I know you want to talk about the guidance, so let me put it into context here. Last year, you've heard me be very clear about our two priorities. First one is driving the business performance and the second is executing the Transformation. You've seen this quarter, you've seen last quarter, you've seen the full year our businesses are delivering the progress we wanted them to.",Analyst,CEO,2025,Citigroup,Q4_2024,1,0.8655,1_the_you_and_that,Profitability,Profitability,2024-12-31,Q4_2024,Other,Positive
"Okay. Great. That's very helpful. And then just maybe pivoting to the buyback, great to see the $20 billion authorization. Obviously, I can't help but ask about beyond 1Q. If we do sort of get this more certainty maybe no increase in capital requirements, does that start to help you maybe at least temporarily lower the buffer to take advantage of, you’re trading below tangible book and getting the accretion and accelerating the buyback? Or how do you think about the rest of the year on the buybacks?","Look, I'll make a couple of comments. So one, we're very pleased to have announced the buyback program at $20 billion. I think, in many ways, that is a demonstration, if you will, of continued confidence in the earnings generation and momentum that we have around that as well as the recognition that we are trading below book and not where we want to be. And you've heard both Jane and I speak to the importance of increasing and doing more in the way of buybacks.",Analyst,CFO,2025,Citigroup,Q4_2024,1,0.8826,1_the_you_and_that,Capital Adequacy,Capital Adequacy,2024-12-31,Q4_2024,Capital Risk,Positive
"Thank you. Mark, just wanted to follow up on your answer to Jim right there. So when you look at the 10% to 11% Return on Average Tangible Common Equity target for 2026. Is that kind of assuming you'll be around the target or like using the 13.1% as the target? And then longer term, you hope to bring that target down as rules get clarified and the franchise gets simplified?","Hey John, good to hear from you. In fact, yes, the 10% to 11% Return on Average Tangible Common Equity target we've set for 2026 does assume that we are running and using a 13.1% Common Equity Tier 1 ratio obviously, there'll be an SCB that comes out sometime later this year. The rules are continuing to evolve and what have you, and we'll factor those in as we know more about them. But yes, it does assume the 13.1% which is our management target, if you will, for Common Equity Tier 1.",Analyst,CFO,2025,Citigroup,Q4_2024,1,0.7469,1_the_you_and_that,Capital Adequacy,Capital Adequacy,2024-12-31,Q4_2024,Capital Risk,Positive
"Okay. Great. And then my next question is, could you clarify what you're expecting this year for card net charge-offs? Understand the quarterly cadence has seasonality. But for the full year, it sounds like you're expecting the charge-offs to be in the range of last year's guidance. Can you just kind of clarify that? And then maybe just talk about provision build, which you had a lot of in 2024 and whether that could slow down as the maturation of balances slows down? Thank you.","Sure. So in terms of the net credit losses and the forecast that we have, we are expecting that the net credit losses will be at the high end of the range that we've given. So in the case of Branded Cards, that 3.5% to 4% is the full year range that we've given. In the case of Retail Services, it's 5.75% to 6.25%, excuse me, and so right now, Retail Services is at that high end at 6.28% for 2024. We'd expect it to stay at that high end, and then on Branded Cards, we're at 3.64%, we'd expect it to creep up to about the 4% level over the course of the year. But remember, that is a full year Net Credit Loss rate, and we know that there's seasonality through the quarters.

"Hi, just a clarification. So you are guiding for three consecutive years of lower expenses including that $600 million repositioning this year. So they were down in 2024, you're guiding them lower in 2025 and you guide them lower in 2026 again, and you're also guiding for three consecutive years of higher revenues based on what you said. I didn't see that in the written materials, but I think I heard you say that, Mark. So three years of lower expenses, three years of higher revenues to at least 2026. Is that correct?","Yes, that is correct. I think you described it correctly. We're seeing continued momentum on the top line. and we're focused on continuing to bring our expenses down just as we did in 2024, a tad bit in 2025 and then more in 2026.",Analyst,CFO,2025,Citigroup,Q4_2024,1,0.7269,1_the_you_and_that,Profitability,Profitability,2024-12-31,Q4_2024,Other,Positive
"All right. And then I guess this is for Jane. Well, that beats haggis on toast, if you achieve that. But I'm wondering why that efficiency might not improve even more. I mean if you have $5 billion of stranded costs and Transformation costs in 2024 and some of that goes down. I heard you're investing in tech and Transformation and volume and the businesses. And there's always a trade-off between the bottom line results you showed today and the growth you show in the future, and it seems like you're going to get this done, the lower expenses while you're leaning into a little bit extra growth. So talk about that trade-off and where you're leaning in for growth a little bit more.","First of all, I'm a little disturbed by your comment about haggis on toast. It's haggis with mashed potatoes and whiskey, just to be clear for everyone.

"I'm kind of confused why you don't pull that lever more aggressively because buying back the stock, the accretion to tangible book, it’s got to be the easiest thing to do to help that Return on Average Tangible Common Equity go up. When you compare and contrast against all the hard work you've been doing, which will obviously be very important to getting the Return on Average Tangible Common Equity up. But why not lean more into that buyback? And can you give us a sense of the timing of that $20 billion? Thank you.","Yes, Betsy, I love the passion. I've got to say I can hear the determination in your voice. I think it's the same determination we feel. Look, we're very committed to returning capital shareholders period. Full stop. We’ve got a $20 billion buyback program, as Mark said, that is reflective of the growing earnings power that we have and our confidence in the path ahead. We've been increasing the amount of capital return over the last few quarters.

"I guess maybe, Jane, I wanted to follow up on a couple of segments. I think you said 2024 turning point for Wealth, and we've seen very steady progress on the Return on Average Tangible Common Equity in Wealth. Just talk to us in terms of, Andy Sieg’s being in the seat for a year now, you've seen progress. What needs to happen? Just talk to us a little bit about the franchise positioning competitively both in the U.S. and abroad as you think about going head-to-head with some of your global competitors and where are the most likely growth opportunities over the next year or two?","Yes. So, our vision, my vision is that we become a global leader in wealth management. There are not many firms that have the globality of Citi. We have all the assets, especially the client relationships all around the world, which were just not tapped for investments in the past. It's a big opportunity. We have $5.3 trillion “off us” from existing clients. And I think the fact that I would find interesting is 55% of it, it's almost $3 trillion with affluent clients in our branch network in America, in the U.S.",Analyst,CEO,2025,Citigroup,Q4_2024,1,0.9399,1_the_you_and_that,Profitability,Profitability,2024-12-31,Q4_2024,Other,Positive
And if I can draw a parallel to the Banking segment with the Return on Average Tangible Common Equity is about 5% to 6% last few quarters. There you brought in Vis Raghavan from JPMorgan. Just give us a sense of could we see a similar trajectory in that business over the next 12 months and where the opportunities are to improve that Return on Average Common Equity?,"Yes. I think absolutely, a strong performance, the strategy we have in place is delivering nicely. So if you look at the revenues, the investment banking fees, positive operating leverage all through the year and gaining share. All three products gaining share in all three in all of the geographies we're in, I'm really excited and happy to see the health care and technology, two areas that we've been investing heavily behind. And you're also seeing us playing a leading role in some of the key transactions, the biggest transactions last year. Mars Kellanova, single adviser, big role in Boeing, and then just this week, the J&J acquisition of Intracellular.

"Thank you. Hate to ask the umpteenth question on the buyback, but clearly, the way the stock is reacting today, the buyback is very important to your shareholders. I guess my first question, if I could have the two questions, is it's very clear that you want to return capital to shareholders. It's very clear that you have excess capital. It's very clear that your PPNR trajectory is positive. And so what are the specific mile markers that that Citi needs to see in order to increase that pacing from that $1.5 billion a quarter to something is more suggestive of a pace that that would be in line with that $20 billion authorization? And I know that's been asked of you already, but is it the consent order? Is it the stress test? We had some news over the holidays that were positive for the sector. Like what are those specific mile markers? I mean you're doing it on the PPNR side, right? Like what do you need to see to have even more confidence, again, like leaning into Betsy’s words, to go all in on the buyback?","Yes. So thank you for the question. Let me make clear a couple of things. So one, and I've said this already, so I apologize for repeating myself, but one, our target for Common Equity Tier 1 is 13.1%, and so what you're going to see over the course of the year is us managing down to that target?

"I guess I'm just trying to think about everybody is super focused on what you had said previously, now you have different targets, but is it just really like, look, it just takes longer, we'll get there, but just takes longer. And maybe just an addendum to that, how should we expect Banamex to impact that 10% to 11% Return on Average Tangible Common Equity in terms of the immediate impact after IPO and then after you deploy that excess capital that you get back?","Erika, we chose the words very carefully to say that 2026 is a way point, it's not the destination. And when I'm looking at it, I'm looking out to 2027, 2028, what is the bank we want to be in terms of our strategy, our performance, our culture, all those different dimensions. And we just relentlessly keep going down that path, but we're going to take the right and responsible decisions as we go down it.

"Okay, I got it. Our expense report on this end. Anyway, just following up, Mark, on your comments about the IPO with Banamex. Can you guys remind us, or refresh our memories, on when the IPO process starts, once it goes public, what percentage ownership do you guys expect to have? And second, have you given us any color on whether you expect to report a gain on this transaction or a loss as you just referenced, that will go through the P&L?","We haven't given any sense for the exact timing of that. As you know, this is a process. And so Jane just spoke to the timing of that process, the first step, having been completed on December 1 with the separation, we are now obviously gearing up and readying ourselves for the IPO.",Analyst,CFO,2025,Citigroup,Q4_2024,1,0.0,1_the_you_and_that,Profitability,Profitability,2024-12-31,Q4_2024,Other,Neutral
"Well, I appreciate the insights. And then as a follow-up question, and I really don't mean this as a ‘what have you done for me lately?’ type of question because you guys have made so much progress in what you're doing in your strategic changes here. But can you talk about the U.S. Personal Banking, many of your questions today is about the Return on Average Tangible Common Equity consolidated and how you can improve that, and this business has a very low Return on Average Tangible Common Equity as you guys know, below your cost of capital. And structurally, when you look at it, if you look at the loans at the end of period just over $220 billion, your deposits about $90 billion, which is quite a bit different than your peers who have much higher ROEs. So how do you approach this business? And again, I know you've been very busy divesting a lot of the businesses that are not important, but it seems to me that this is a giant hurdle that you guys have to approach at some point in the near future.","Let me just chat a bit through this. So what’s the path to the higher returns in U.S. Personal Banking, it’s coming from top line revenue growth, improved expense base and also a lot more normalized credit environment, and that gets us to the mid- to high-teen returns in the medium term. I think we feel very confident and comfortable in that. You're seeing the proof points I talked about Banking, Wealth earlier, we’ve had another good quarter of revenue growth, had the ninth consecutive quarter of positive operating leverage.

"Hi, I just want to follow up on Page 9 where you break out the technology and Transformation investment spend. And sorry if I missed this, but did you talk about the pace of those two levels in your 2025 and 2026 expense guidance? I know directionally, you said it's going up. But did you give a magnitude?","I did not. Obviously, for both technology and Transformation those are areas that we are going to continue to invest in for all the reasons that we've mentioned. They obviously contribute to the number in 2025 being slightly down from the $53.8 billion, but they also represent, as I mentioned, what we believe is required to kind of get the work done that we need to get done.

We know what we need to be spending on. Through the annual planning process that that concluded last month, it was clear we did need to invest more. We increased the scope of some of the work on the data front. We brought some other work forward. We looked at what we needed to do on the technology front and some of the critical investments.

"Mark, the Net Interest Income ex-Markets outlook, if I just take the fourth quarter and annualize that, I get to something in the neighborhood of, I think, around $47.4 billion, $47.5 billion which is above the full year 2024 level. I'm not sure exactly what “up modestly” means, if that's 1%, 3%, 4%, but, and correct me if you think I’m wrong, but it seems like maybe there's a little bit of conservatism built in? If you can just comment on how you think, and how we should think about the quarterly trajectory of NI ex-Markets? Obviously, there's a day count issue in 1Q, but maybe how do you think through like, how we should expect that Net Interest Income to evolve over the course of the year?","I mean, why don't I just kind of cut to the chase on it a little bit, Saul, in the sense that, “up modestly”, call it a couple of percentage points, 2 to 3 percentage points or so, right, in terms of how I think about it. And I think I've taken, I’ve gone through kind of the tailwinds and headwinds, so I won't kind of take you through that again. But I think the important takeaway should be that we're going to see continued momentum across the franchise driven by loan growth in the Branded Card side of the business and continued deposit momentum, particularly operating deposits in Services. And we're going to do everything that we always do around the management of pricing, and we'll get a benefit from how we've been managing our investment portfolio as those things mature. The combination of those efforts will offset, more than offset some of the headwinds that you'd expect in a declining rate environment, and modestly is, call it, 2% to 3%.",Analyst,CFO,2025,Citigroup,Q4_2024,1,0.9119,1_the_you_and_that,Profitability,Profitability,2024-12-31,Q4_2024,Other,Positive
"Okay. Fair enough. And then on the expense outlook getting to below $53 billion in 2026, I know that's consistent with what you've said in the past, does imply a pretty sharp reduction in 2026, especially in light of continued revenue growth, it's pretty material operating leverage. Just I mean, how much benefit do you get from a more normalized severance? In other words, how much are we thinking about severance coming down? What's sort of the impact or how to think about the Legacy, stranded costs coming down? Just maybe a little bit more meat on the bone in terms of how much these items will benefit 2026 versus 2025?","Look, a couple of things. As I look at our severance costs, which, as I mentioned, has been running high, it was $700 million, we're forecasting $600 million in 2025. I think kind of normal through the cycle is probably, call it, $300 million or so.

"Hi, this is your first full year of having the five line of business structure. So, Mark, do you still have the same line of business targets that you had last year?

And I'm just wondering, is the worst over in terms of that kind of reorganization internally and the culture and the sentiment and how you see that continuing? But first, the concrete question about the targets, please.","So I guess I'll start first. So in terms of the targets, look, we set the targets across each of the lines of business for the medium term. We've obviously brought down the 2026 to 10% to 11%. And so you'd imagine there's some movement, at least for the 2026 in terms of those targets, Banking will likely be a little bit lower than the mid-15%, if I think about 2026 as being that medium-term target date. But over time, I expect that the targets that I've set are the targets that we will achieve and even more because, as Jane mentioned, 10% to 11%, while that's our 2026 target, it is not our longer-term target as we think about Return on Average Tangible Common Equity and the strength of these businesses in the aggregate franchise.

Is it balances? It sounds like it's migration, but just I'd be curious to hear your thoughts on the biggest drivers of upside or downside.","Yeah. So, I mean I think the drivers of, let's say, what's embedded in the current guidance is actually not meaningfully different from what it was in the fourth quarter, meaning it's the current yield curve, which is a little bit stale now. But the snap from quarter-end had roughly three cuts in it. So, it's the current yield curve, it's what I just said, the expectation of ongoing internal migration.

We didn't see that this quarter. Is that just kind of seasonal? And would you still expect the kind of growth math to play out in terms of Card growth and reserve build needs?","Yeah, John. So, in short, yes to both questions. So, yes, the relative lack of build this quarter is a function of the normal seasonal patterns of Card. Yes, we still expect 12% Card loan growth for the full year. And yes, that still means that all else equal, we think the consensus for the allowance build for the back three quarters is still a little too low, if you map it to that expected Card loan growth.",Analyst,CFO,2024,JPMorgan,Q1_2024,1,0.9309,1_the_you_and_that,Liquidity Risk,Liquidity Risk,2024-03-31,Q1_2024,Liquidity Risk,Positive

But the idea would be the way you're structuring trades, the way the balance sheet is evolving, there’s some offset that you'd expect in Markets fees from the lower Markets Net Interest Income, correct?","That is exactly right.

"Hi. Good morning. Given that your response to Betsy's question is that 15% Common Equity Tier 1 today prepares you for Basel III Endgame as written, you earn 22% on – without the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation assessment. Ahead of Investor Day, I guess, six weeks from now or a week from now, as we think about that 17% through-the-cycle target, if you're at the right capital level per you guys, where are you over-earning today?","Right. So, interesting framing of the question, Erika. So, I think we've been pretty consistent about where we're over-earning, right? So, obviously, one major area is that we're over-earning in deposit margin, especially in consumer and that's sort of why we're expecting sequential declines in Net Interest Income, why we've talked about compressing deposit margins and increases in weighted average rate paid.

As we think about that $90 billion, if we price rate cuts out totally, does that matter much given it seems like June is the only one that would...","Yeah. Sorry, Erika. So, just quick things on this. One, let's focus on Net Interest Income ex., not on total Net Interest Income. So, I'd anchor you to the $89 billion.

And do you feel like this is the type of environment where, given that lingering uncertainty about rates, clients are either more engaged or less engaged in terms of how they're positioning portfolios? Thanks.","Yeah. Really good question. I would say, in general, that the sort of volatility and uncertainty in the rate environment overall on balance is actually supportive for the Markets revenue pool.

And I just use some of your own numbers from the past of like, the market has added like $40 trillion of equity market cap and $40 trillion of fixed income market cap last 10 years, yet the wallet is like 20% plus below the 10-year average.

So, I think the first thing to say which is somewhat obvious but I'm going to say it anyway is that, there are some like auto-governors in this, right? Like some portion of the expense base is directly related to revenue, whether it's volume-related commissions, whether it's incentive compensation, whether it's other things.

So, I think what Jamie was sort of suggesting is that, you can think of the concept as kind of like strategic capital versus tactical capital for lack of a better term. And what he's kind of saying is that, in a moment where you're carrying a lot of excess capital sort of for strategic reasons, you have the ability at least in theory to deploy portions of that with kind of like – into relatively short-duration assets or strategies or client opportunities in whatever moment for whatever reason, and what might be thought of as a tactical sense.",Analyst,CFO,2024,JPMorgan,Q1_2024,1,0.9203,1_the_you_and_that,Capital Adequacy,Capital Adequacy,2024-03-31,Q1_2024,Capital Risk,Positive

Can you guys share or can you share with us the color on what's going on in the corporate lending market in terms of spreads seem to be getting tighter? It's not reflecting, I don't think, a real fear out there in the global geopolitical world. And any color just on what you guys are seeing in the leveraged loan market as well?","Right. So, I think what's true about spreads in general, just broadly credit spreads including secondary markets and to some extent the leverage lending space, is that they are exceptionally tight. So, I'm sure that's reversed a little bit in the last few days. But broadly throughout the quarter, we've really seen credit spreads tighten quite a bit. You even see that a little bit in our OCI this quarter, where losses in OCI that we would've had from higher rates have been meaningfully offset by tighter credit spreads in the portfolio. So broadly, sort of in keeping with the big run-up that we saw in equity markets and the general sort of bullish tone, you saw quite a bit of credit spread tightening in secondary markets.",Analyst,CFO,2024,JPMorgan,Q1_2024,1,0.8826,1_the_you_and_that,Macroeconomic Risk,Macroeconomic Risk,2024-03-31,Q1_2024,Macro Risk,Positive

How you balance the two out, where you may see them bidding on business that you'd like but at the same time you're supporting their business?","Right. Yeah. I mean, I think that tension between us as a provider of secured financing to some portions of the private credit, private equity community, you're talking about different parts of the capital structure.

And can you just talk through how that's also just informing any changes in your – some of your growth and reserving expectations? Thanks.","Sure, Ken. So I mean, at a high level, I would say that obviously, some of the salient news flow is quite recent. So, we've done some soundings and some checking both on the consumer side and on the wholesale side.",Analyst,CFO,2025,JPMorgan,Q1_2025,1,0.5267,1_the_you_and_that,Macroeconomic Risk,Macroeconomic Risk,2025-03-31,Q1_2025,Macro Risk,Positive
"Yeah. And just one question on the Net Interest Income ex. Markets holding at $90 billion. Can you just walk us through the puts and takes of just what's the new curve you're using, which also is subject to change every day and what might have been some of the positive offsets to if you put in more expected cuts than you had before? Thanks.","Yeah, that's a good question, Ken. You're right. So if you remember, last quarter we said that we had one cut in the curve. I think latest curve has something like three cuts. And so, we've talked a lot, obviously, about how we are asset sensitive. You now see our EaR disclosed in the supplement, and probably our empirical EaR is a little bit higher than our modeled EaR as a result of the relatively low – lower than modeled rates paid in Consumer. So when you put that together, all else equal, the drop in the weighted-average IORB, which is about 22 basis points, should produce a notable headwind in our Net Interest Income ex.

"So, I guess, just the question here is, can you double-click on how you think this is going to impact the economy going forward and maybe double-click on Jeremy's statement that the banking system should be a source of strength?","I just – before Jamie answers that, Erika, I just want to make one brief comment, which is the banking system being a source of strength means what it says. In other words, banks doing their job to support the economy. That's not a statement about bank equity performance and the extent to which banks are cyclical or not. Like obviously, a recessionary environment, as I've frequently said, all else equal, is bad for banks  from an equity performance perspective.

"And to that point, the second question is on the reserve. Jeremy, you mentioned a weighted-average unemployment rate of 5.8%. I think that's above where economists are thinking we could peak even in a recession scenario. How should we think about any incremental builds from here? And what you are going – obviously, deterioration in the outlook, but what more do you need to see in terms of how you make decisions about further builds from here?","Yeah, Erika, it's a good question. But the truth is there's just a little bit too much uncertainty right now for me to sort of give an outlook for reserves, which is generally not a thing that we do anyway.",Analyst,CFO,2025,JPMorgan,Q1_2025,1,0.34,1_the_you_and_that,Interest Rate Risk,Interest Rate Risk,2025-03-31,Q1_2025,Market Risk,Positive
"Hi, good morning. Jeremy, on that same topic, no change to the full year credit Card net charge-off forecast. How do we square that with the rising recession risk? Is it because you already have a couple of months of delinquencies kind of baked in the cake and this is more an issue for next year, or just too early to call?",We should have not given you that forecast.

"Okay. Got it. And then just on capital, how does this type of macro uncertainty impact your thinking around conserving capital as opposed to deploying it through your investment agenda and buybacks as the stock gets cheaper? Or just, are you still looking to arrest the increase or does this kind of change it?","The investment that we do in banks, branches, technology, Artificial Intelligence is going to continue regardless of the environment. And then we have – depending what happens to Basel III and Comprehensive Capital Analysis and G-SIFI and all that, $30 billion to $60 billion of excess capital. And in the Chairman's letter, I wrote about what we think of that. But based upon the environment, the turbulence issues, I like having excess capital. We are prepared for any environment.

Just talk about some of the puts and takes in that up 7% year-over-year.,"Yeah, it's a good question and we're seeing that too. So let me talk about travel. I mean we obviously saw the airlines discuss what they are seeing as headwinds for them, specifically in airline travel, and we're seeing that too through the card spend.

"Hi. Good morning and thanks for taking my questions. Wanted to start off with one on the proposed SLR changes and just the impact of rate volatility. The Treasury is committed to providing relief to the banks under the SLR just to help mitigate some of the volatility in the 10-year. But given the geopolitical concerns, weakening global demand for treasuries, how does it inform your appetite just for purchasing U.S. Treasuries if those reforms are implemented and just how you're managing rate risk maybe more holistically across the Firm, just in light of some the recent volatility?","Yes. So SLR alone isn't going to change that much for us. It may change for other people.

"Thank you both for that perspective. And just for my follow-up, did want to ask on the Markets outlook. So, admittedly, less surprising to hear some of the cautious Investment Banking Return on Average Tangible Common Equity: Return on Average Tangible commentary in light of the uncertainty. But was hoping you could just speak to the Markets businesses which have been performing extraordinarily well of late and just given the combination of elevated volatility, but also some indications that clients are taking down risk, how you expect that business to perform over the coming quarters.","Yeah. It's a good question. As you know, Steve, we're obviously not going to give Markets guidance. Your guess is as good as ours at some level. But the ingredients are the right ingredients. I mean, we've often discussed about how this business, all else equal, benefits from a volatile environment if markets are operating relatively normally, which they more or less have been. Of course, it's not guaranteed. We need to do a good job managing the risk. And yeah, there are states of the world where if our clients are struggling or deleveraging or taking down risk, that could be a headwind for us.

"Thank you. Hi, Jeremy and Jamie. Can you guys share with us – if you take a look at the non-traditional lenders, private credit lenders, they've been very active in grabbing market share from the traditional commercial banks over the last two or three years, particularly since the initial Basel III Endgame proposal came out in July of 2023, which is no longer applicable. But are you guys seeing any opportunities where customers may re-intermediate back into the banks like your bank because of this volatility?","I mean that's hard to tell, Gerard. I think it's too early to tell. But what I would say is that it kind of – your question aligns with what we've been saying about this space for some time, which is we want to be product agnostic here and give our clients the best option that makes sense for them in the moment.

Can you opine for us your views? Are you more confident with the new administration, the new personnel, whether it's Treasury Secretary Bessent or others, the nominees for different regulatory heads that there will be a better chance of real regulatory reform, they see it the way you guys do versus the prior administration?","Yeah, I mean, Gerard, we always say this, and it's true, which is that we work with all administrations and every administration as constructively as possible to express our opinions and advocate for the things that we think are right for the banking system and for the economy as a whole, and that was true before, and it's true now with this administration as well.",Analyst,CFO,2025,JPMorgan,Q1_2025,1,0.8934,1_the_you_and_that,Macroeconomic Risk,Macroeconomic Risk,2025-03-31,Q1_2025,Macro Risk,Positive
"Thank you. Good morning. I guess just wanted to follow up on the macro uncertainty. I think when you talk to investors, we've gone from enthusiasm for a pro-business administration to a lot of headwinds. And I think Jamie mentioned you'll have companies take down guidance, et cetera, potentially over the coming weeks. I'm just wondering what is it you think we need to see before this uncertainty abates, or the 90-day pause that we saw with some of the other countries on tariffs. Is that enough? Or I'm just wondering when you talk to clients, corporate CEOs, what are they looking for from the administration that would inject confidence to get back anywhere close to where we were maybe 60 or 90 days ago?","First of all, some of all the issues that are raised existed before the new administration, like the geopolitical situation, the excess fiscal deficits, poorly done regulations and all that. Obviously, pro-growth is good, pro-business is good, pro-dereg is good. I think the best thing to do is to allow the Secretary of Treasury and the folks working with him and the administration to finish as quick as possible the agreements that they need to make with – around tariffs and with our trading partners. And I think there'll be agreements in principle. They're not going to be – trade agreements themselves would be 5,000 or 10,000 pages long. And that's the best way to go about it right now.

We look at all the cycles. And you know we prepare for a full range of outcomes. We're not – I don't personally like predicting what the future is going to hold.

I'm going into this because I noticed your average loan growth, I think it was running at about 2% year-on-year. And then end of period loans was up 5% and wholesale loans was up 7%. So I'm just wondering if there was some line drawdowns at quarter end. And it's a broader question on just liquidity. Do you see your customers looking for more liquidity? Are they drawing down lines? And maybe if you could speak to liquidity in the front end of the market, that would be helpful, too. Thank you.","Yeah, it's a good question, Betsy. So a couple of things. One is in our soundings of our wholesale clients during sort of the moments of peak uncertainty, we did hear them talking about wanting to focus on shoring up liquidity. Interestingly, I actually asked the question like a day ago, whether we were seeing draws, meaningfully observable draws from clients. And the answer to that question was no, at least not yet.

No, I don't think we'll necessarily be through all the uncertainty. I think you'll just know a lot more. And my quote was about, get over it. I wish I hadn't said it. I was specifically referring to tariffs relating to protecting national security. National security is paramount. All things should be subordinated to it.

Thanks. Good morning. I just wanted to ask a little bit about how you're feeling about the trade-off between like the commercial economy and what might come through in terms of future loan growth versus the kind of green shoots that people are talking about in the Investment Banking pipeline and just how it feels in terms of like re-opening of markets and the trade-off between getting some more of those fees in versus what's happening on the loan demand side. Thanks.,"Sure. Good question, Ken. So I think in terms of Investment Banking and Markets, yeah, slightly better than expected last month. What I would talk about green shoots especially in Capital Markets generally, still definitely some headwinds in Mergers & Acquisitions, lower announced activity, some regulatory headwinds there, so we'll see.",Analyst,CFO,2023,JPMorgan,Q2_2023,1,0.8593,1_the_you_and_that,Macroeconomic Risk,Macroeconomic Risk,2023-06-30,Q2_2023,Macro Risk,Positive
"That makes sense. And as a follow-up to that, on the Consumer side you mentioned that consumers continue to spend albeit a little more slowly, and you mentioned that consumers are also using their excess deposits a little bit more as well. Can you just elaborate a little bit more on just your feeling about the state of the consumer? And is that Card growth continue to be driven by people needing to revolve as opposed to wanting to have more in their deposits? Just kind of want the trade-off on that side too?","Yeah.

Jeremy, can you give us your view on how you're measuring the treasury functions and the asset liability of your balance sheet as we go forward versus the way you guys were positioning and managing it a year ago in view of the fact that it looks like maybe we're approaching the terminal rate on Fed funds rates?","Yeah.

"Good morning. I guess just first question, following up on the outlook for the economy. Like, we've all been worried about the recession for a year and there's a debate about the lagged effects of the Fed rate hike cycle. When you think about – Jeremy, I think you mentioned your unemployment outlook relatively similar today versus a quarter ago – how worried should we be in terms of the credit cycle 6 to 12 months from now? Or are you leaning towards concluding that maybe U.S. businesses, consumers have absorbed the rate cycle a lot better than we expected a year ago?","Yeah. So, I mean, I'm sure Jamie has some views here. But in my view, I would just caution against jumping to too many super-positive conclusions based on a couple of recent prints. And I think generally, our point is less about trying to predict a particular outcome and more about trying to make sure that we don't get too much euphoria that over-concentrates people on one particular prediction when we know that there's a range of outcomes out there.",Analyst,CFO,2023,JPMorgan,Q2_2023,1,0.9132,1_the_you_and_that,Macroeconomic Risk,Macroeconomic Risk,2023-06-30,Q2_2023,Macro Risk,Positive

So as I go through the 10-Qs over the next four, five quarters, I should expect that that $2.5 billion should come down because deposit betas you're anticipating are going to be accelerating from here? I'm just trying to put those two things together.","Yeah, it's a good question. It's quite a technical issue. So I think in the past, the way this number was constructed was to assume through-the-cycle betas on all the deposits, and so your notion that like the number would include deposit beta acceleration would not have been the case because it would've been using essentially terminal deposit betas based on the forward curve and then based on a 100% shock to the forward curve.",Analyst,CFO,2023,JPMorgan,Q2_2023,1,0.6956,1_the_you_and_that,Liquidity Risk,Liquidity Risk,2023-06-30,Q2_2023,Liquidity Risk,Positive

"Good morning. So I'm in your camp that eventually consumers will want more deposit rate sensitivity here. But I guess what would make you change your rates meaningfully? So the top two banks have about 50% consumer market share, loan-to-deposit ratios are low. Your outlook for loan growth, and I think others, is fairly sluggish, at least outside of Card. I get that it's common sense, and that's what we've seen historically. But there really is this kind of big divergence among big banks and everybody else where the big banks just don't need to pay that much for deposits for a slew of reasons.

"Yeah. I mean, again, I 100% agree, but we've never seen kind of loans-to-deposit ratios for banks like yours this low, so you could just let deposits run off at a modest amount for quite some time and make the decision not to pay up.

"Morning. Jeremy, on page 4 of your presentation, you show some liquidity metrics. And there's been a meaningful deterioration, or I shouldn't say deterioration, depletion of some of that excess liquidity, obviously for First Republic primarily. So my question is how quickly do you want to rebuild that liquidity because as I look out towards 2024, there's probably a half dozen variables that are going to make liquidity a premium event – to have excess liquidity? So that's my first question. What's your plans for replenishing that liquidity?","Yeah. Charlie, so I know we talked about this a little bit at Investor Day, right? So as I said in my prepared remarks, yeah, we think about half of the change in the bank Liquidity Coverage Ratio Market. number is a consequence of First Republic and the rest of it is just the expected decrease in system-wide deposits flowing through into our High Quality Liquid Assets balances and the bank Liquidity Coverage Ratio Market. ratio.",Analyst,CFO,2023,JPMorgan,Q2_2023,1,0.743,1_the_you_and_that,Liquidity Risk,Liquidity Risk,2023-06-30,Q2_2023,Liquidity Risk,Positive
"All right. So sort of wrapped into that as a follow-up, if you take your $87 billion forecast for Net Interest Income this year, and that implies at least one quarter of maybe $22 billion of Net Interest Income, and you take your eventual forecast of mid-$70 billion of Net Interest Income at some point in the future, that would imply at least one quarter of $18 billion of Net Interest Income so that's about an 18% drop. And if you hold the balance sheet steady, you're talking about a 30-basis point drop in your margin, your Net Interest Margin, to get from $22 billion to $18 billion. I mean, what is driving – is it really the deposit or are you thinking in terms of interest reversals as credit deteriorates or is it rebuilding of liquidity? I'm just trying to get a better sense of the impact is.","Yeah. Hey, Charlie. I would think about that as being really entirely a deposit story. It's just not that complicated, right? I think we did this – I think it was either in the fourth quarter or in the first quarter – where we put a little chart on a page, just very simple terms, that shows what the dollar consequences are of whatever – like 10-basis point change in deposit rate paid in terms of Net Interest Income run rate.",Analyst,CFO,2023,JPMorgan,Q2_2023,1,0.7717,1_the_you_and_that,Liquidity Risk,Liquidity Risk,2023-06-30,Q2_2023,Liquidity Risk,Positive

Want to dig in on the Net Interest Income side. So you raised the 2023 Net Interest Income ex. Markets guidance by $2 billion for this year.

So on loan growth, the story is pretty consistent with what we've been saying all year. So we've, of course, seen very robust loan growth in Card, and that's coming from both spending growth and the normalization in revolving balances.

But in view of all of these fintechs and all of these other nonbank competitors that we're all supposed to pick away at everybody's market share, you guys have put up great numbers here. What's the drivers behind an Return on Average Common Equity? Even when you take that credit over-earning out, what's driving this business' profitability at such high levels?","Yeah, Gerard.

"Very good.

Your non-interest-bearing deposits I think are around 28% of total deposits which is slightly above the 26% you guys had back in 2018 or 2019 or pre-pandemic. Is this expectation that you're going to see more of the non-interest-bearing deposits go into interest-bearing? Or, is it just the repricing of interest-bearing deposits that have some of your folks inside JPMorgan a little more cautious on that net interest income number?","Yeah. It's a good question, Gerard. I think it's a little bit bigger picture than that.

Your new guide for net interest income for this year would imply an exit run rate of $22.9 billion in the fourth quarter. As we think about the dynamics in higher-for-longer, on one hand, your fixed rate assets will continue to reprice. On the other, you even asked a lot about the deposit dynamics that could continue to creep higher. How do we think about those puts and takes as we think about that relative to that exit rate of $22.9 billion in the fourth quarter?","Yeah.

But at the end of the day, it feels like for the portfolio managers that own JPMorgan through the cycle, does Basel III Endgame really harm your natural earnings power and returns?","Yeah. Okay.

So I think it's probably fair to say that the outperformance late in the quarter in investment banking fees was to a meaningful degree, as I mentioned, driven by Debt Capital Markets as well as to some degree driven by the acceleration of the closing of some Mergers & Acquisitions transactions. And I do think that some of that Debt Capital Markets outperformance is in the sort of types of deals that are opportunistic deals that aren't in our pipeline, and those are often driven by treasurers and CFOs sort of seeing improvement in market levels and jumping on those. So it's possible that that's a little bit of a consequence of the cuts.",Analyst,CFO,2024,JPMorgan,Q3_2024,1,0.079,1_the_you_and_that,Interest Rate Risk,Interest Rate Risk,2024-09-30,Q3_2024,Market Risk,Neutral
"And then specifically in the debit and credit card spend that you guys break out, you had nice growth year-over-year, up 6%, flat quarter-over-quarter, I know there's a lot of seasonality 2Q to 3Q. I think last year, it was up about 1%. But are you seeing any kind of changes in the consumer spend either the mix or some signs of a slowdown later in the quarter? Thank you.","So I think what there is to say about consumer spend is a little bit boring in a sense because what's happened is that it's become normal, so meaning – I mean, I think we're getting to the point where it no longer makes sense to talk about the pandemic, but maybe one last time. One of the things that you had was that heavy rotation into T&E as people did a lot of traveling and they booked cruises that they hadn't done before, and everyone was going out to dinner a lot, whatever. So you had the big spike in T&E, the big rotation into discretionary spending, and that's now normalized. And you would normally think that rotation out of discretionary into nondiscretionary would be a sign of consumers battening down the hatches and getting ready for a much worse environment. But given the levels that it started from, what we see it as is actually like normalization.

"Hey. Jamie, I think I've seen you comment on government this year more than any other time in your career. And the August 2 op-ed, Washington Post, Davos you're talking about government. I think it was this week or last week on Bloomberg, you're saying bank mergers should be allowed. Your bus tour in August, you were asked, which is my question now, under what circumstances would you leave for government service and your answer then was “I love what I do.” We get it you love what you do. But under what circumstances would you consider government service? It seems like you'd be more likely to go now than in the past just based on the numerous comments that you've made.

My country is more important to me than my company, and I think this government is very important to get this – and if you look at the world today, Mike, it is so important that we get things right for the whole geopolitical world. I'm not just talking about the American economy, and we try to participate in policy at the local level, at the state level, at the federal level, at the international level to try to help. That's our job. We try to grow economies and things like that. So nothing has changed in my view, my opinion, or my interest.

"Let me take the flip side of that question for those of you who are worried about you leaving. The other side of the question is we were on these calls the last couple of years. You're saying the stock is over-valued, and I think that's what you're saying. You're saying the stock market is over-valued and therefore all stocks are over-valued. And on the one hand, you guys, you highlight on this call Artificial Intelligence, tech, market share gains, high returns, high capital. So, do you think in some ways when we think about the value of your price, and your ability to do buybacks, you're thinking more about an old school model for valuing your stock as opposed to a new school model that might put you in the category of more tech-oriented firms, especially as it relates to your progress with Artificial Intelligence.","Listen, you're making a very good point, which is I think we have an exceptional company, exceptional franchises, and the price point at which you might buy the stock. But I'm not that exuberant about thinking even tech valuations or any valuations will stay at these very inflated values. And so I'm just – we're just quite patient in that, and I think you're going to have to judge us over time about whether we're done the right thing to do nothing. And remember, we could always do it. We haven't lost the money. It didn't go away. It's sitting in store. The only time that would be really wrong is if the stock runs way up, we've got to buy at much higher prices.

Another area I would appreciate if you can address is we've been hearing a lot about the likes of Jane Street and other market makers potentially disrupting fixed income trading. Is that a real risk? And is there an opportunity for a firm like JPMorgan to actually compete on the private venue side on market making beyond traditional sort of FICC activity?","Yeah, Ebrahim, the way I would frame that is not as a risk but as a reality. We've always emphasized in all of our businesses that we operate in an extremely competitive environment, and that applies to – and that competitive environment isn't limited to competing against banks or traditional financial institutions. It extends in the consumer space to fintechs.

Give us your perspective on just the risk of market liquidity shock as we move into year-end and do you have a view on how quickly Fed should recalibrate QT or actually stop QT to prevent some loss? Thanks.","Yeah. It's a good question, Ebrahim. But I think you've kind of answered your own question. In other words, like the argument out there is that the repo spike that we saw at the end of this quarter was an indication that maybe the market is approaching that lowest comfortable level of reserves that's been heavily speculated about.

The 2025 consensus was $90 billion on Net Interest Income ex. and our point was that that number, which remains an asset-sensitive number, indicated an insufficient amount of sequential decline year-on-year.

And I think you've laid out the building blocks there already. Just for simplicity, I'm going to try to answer your question without referring to the disclosed Citi Commercial Bank deposit margin number, just because that number is obviously the combination of the rate paid on the Citi Commercial Bank deposits and the internal FTP into that. And that is a complicated thing that evolves as a function of the modeling of the betas and other things.

Good morning. Thanks for all the comments on the net interest income. Any updates on that medium term outlook that you've put out there?,"Yeah. Matt, not particularly updating. I think you're referring to that $80 billion number that we'd put out there, and I wouldn't exactly describe that as an outlook. I think it's more just a number that we put out there to try to quantify a little bit the extent of the over earning. So, not particularly necessary to revise the number. But I just would point out, again, as we highlight on the page, and as I highlighted in the prepared remarks, that when you look at that $94 billion exit rate and full year guidance of $88 billion, that implies obviously exiting below $88 billion and some significant sequential decline. So, in that sense, you can see us kind of marching on the path to that $80 billion.

"Okay. And then just separately, you bought back couple of billion dollars of stock this quarter. What's your thought process on buybacks given the strong capital generation, but also some uncertainty on regulatory proposals?","Yeah. Good question. And I think you framed it exactly correctly in the sense that we obviously have a lot of buyback capacity in general based on our organic capital generation. So, the normal capital hierarchy will apply. But for now, we plan to remain on a modest pace of buybacks consistent with that kind of $2 billion net buyback a quarter number that we've talked about and that you've seen us do, in light of the – probably the need to continue building to have a bit of a buffer, as you said, the uncertainty about the finalization of the rules. And also just as a reminder, the SCB is probably a little bit low right now and has been quite volatile.

Actually, John, this quarter, that's all like pretty quiet. So, the weighted average unemployment rate number is still 5.5%. We didn't have any really big revisions in the macro outlook driving the numbers, and our skew remains as it has been – a little bit skewed to the downside. Just recognizing that we still see risks being elevated, which obviously you can see that skew in the difference between the weighted average unemployment of 5.5%, and what's in our central outlook, which I think is something like 4.6% (sic) [4.4%] peak of the current levels.",Analyst,CFO,2024,JPMorgan,Q4_2023,1,0.2023,1_the_you_and_that,Asset Quality and Credit Risk,Asset Quality and Credit Risk,2023-12-31,Q4_2023,Credit Risk,Positive

I know it's complicated, but maybe a little bit of color on like how sensitive you are to a couple of cuts might be helpful.","Sure. Yeah, happy to do that, John. So, I think probably the best way to do this is to look at our EaR numbers. So, as you know, we don't update that until the Q. But on an estimated basis, it's going to be a little bit lower. So, I think something like $1.9 billion as opposed to $2.1 billion. So, just round numbers, about $2 billion in EaR. I think, empirically, the number is maybe a little higher than that just because even though we do model lags in the EaR, we've been seeing the lag effect be a little bit bigger. But just crudely, I think as I noted, we do remain asset-sensitive. That's one way to quantify it.

"Hey. Good morning. Maybe just to follow up in a different way on the Net Interest Income question, just in deposits, can you, Jeremy, discuss your assumptions on the reprice and migration thoughts? And then, layering in if we do get six cuts, does that start to change the dynamic around growth in deposits? How are you thinking about all that?","Yeah. Both good questions. So let's do reprice first. So, I think all else equal, this more dovish Fed environment and these six cuts has the effect of taking a little bit of pressure off the reprice, especially product-level reprice. At the same time, we do continue to expect internal migration, particularly out of checking and savings into CDs, and in Wholesale, a little bit of ongoing migration out of non-interest-bearing into interest-bearing.",Analyst,CFO,2024,JPMorgan,Q4_2023,1,0.2415,1_the_you_and_that,Liquidity Risk,Liquidity Risk,2023-12-31,Q4_2023,Liquidity Risk,Positive

Is the market pricing in correctly? Or when you look at your customer base, are you still worried about the lagged effects of the rate hikes?","Right. Okay, Ebrahim. So, I think a lot of those things aren't actually mutually exclusive. So, statement one, I think it's uncontroversial that the economic outlook has evolved to include a significantly higher probability of a soft landing. That's, I think, the consensus at this point.

"Hi. Good morning. My first question is a follow-up on Matt's with regarding the buyback. You printed 15% Common Equity Tier 1 in the quarter. On a net basis, net of Risk-Weighted Assets growth, your net income produces 51 basis points every quarter. Again, that's net of Risk-Weighted Assets growth. I'm wondering what guideposts you're looking for, Jeremy, in terms of that buyback increasing from that $2 billion a quarter. Do we need to wait for Basel III finalization, which seems like it could be quite delayed? Or will having clarity in the June D-FAST results – you mentioned the SCB – sort of be enough that you could reconsider this pace over the medium term?","Yeah. Erika, that's a good question. And I understand what you're asking – why you're asking it. I think the answer is going to be a little bit unsatisfying, which is that this is classic decision-making under uncertainty and it's kind of a probabilistic cloud of a variety of different factors. But, all the ingredients that you've listed are the right ingredients; right, very strong organic capital generation, uncertainty about the finalization of the rule, uncertainty about the SCB requirements, and obviously, our normal capital hierarchy, which is that buybacks are always at the bottom of the hierarchy after we're done using the capital for our other priorities.",Analyst,CFO,2024,JPMorgan,Q4_2023,1,0.138,1_the_you_and_that,Capital Adequacy,Capital Adequacy,2023-12-31,Q4_2023,Capital Risk,Neutral

So, you would see that. We often talk about the volume in revenue related category, and I think in my prepared remarks, you will have noted that I talked about a $1 billion increase in that category year-on-year as a result of an improved Non-interest Revenue outlook.

I know we've been through this before two years ago with the big increase in expenses and without a lot of visibility. So, if you could just upfront give us visibility, how much of that is due to incentive pay, how much is that due to tech, how much is that due to Artificial Intelligence and what are the expected returns to get from that $7 billion pick-up?

And second, are you surprised that QT hasn't been more disruptive to the liquidity in the markets?","Yeah. Good question, Gerard. I mean, I think you've heard Jamie talk about this a lot. QT is obviously a big focus and one of the complicating elements that we have in the current environment. I think that the math is the math in the sense that QT, all else equal, is withdrawing from system-wide deposits.

So, if you go into the details a little bit, if you start with Equity Capital Markets, that helps. Higher and – well, the recent rally in the equity markets helps. I think there've been some modest challenges with the 2023 IPO vintage in terms of post-launch performance or whatever.

"Thank you. I have a question about the role that First Republic plays in your Net Interest Income forecast. I'm assuming, because you'll have a full year in 2024 of First Republic that their contribution of Net Interest Income will be up, let's say, from $3.7 billion this year to $5 billion to $6 billion next year. But given that you're forecasting six rate cuts, is that a detractor to your assumptions of Net Interest Income from First Republic? Or – I mean, you have that Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation note, and then you also have a significant amount of adjustable rate mortgages that I assume are repricing upwards. So, if you're talking about rate cuts, that would hurt your Net Interest Income forecast from First Republic, I'm guessing. But if rates stay higher for longer, wouldn't First Republic be a much bigger contributor? So, talk about the sensitivities of First Republic there.","Yeah. Thanks, Charlie. So, one thing that we said when we kind of gave First Republic guidance at Investor Day earlier this year is that while we understood the need to track that, and we've been splitting out First Republic in our reported results in order to improve period-on-period comparability, we kind of want to stay out of the business of guiding on First Republic.",Analyst,CFO,2024,JPMorgan,Q4_2023,1,0.791,1_the_you_and_that,Interest Rate Risk,Interest Rate Risk,2023-12-31,Q4_2023,Market Risk,Positive

Jeremy, I wanted to ask about capital, and I know you get this question a lot about the kind of high-class dilemma of your growing capital base and your perspective of that as earnings in store.

Thanks.,"So, yeah, you've noted all the points that we always make so I won't repeat them. And I think the way we're thinking about it right now is that we feel very comfortable with the notion that it makes sense for us to have a nice store of extra capital in light of the current environment. We believe there's a good chance that there will be a moment where we get to deploy it at better levels essentially in whatever way than the current opportunities would suggest. And so that feels like a correct kind of strategic and financial decision for us.

And then just as a follow-up, when we think about the investment spend agenda this year, how does it differ from, say, last year or last couple of years across lines of business in this kind of certainty of return spectrum you've talked about? And then what kind of efficiencies are baked into the outlook as well? Thanks.","Sure. The truth is – and I guess this is a good thing that the themes are remarkably consistent. So, we are seeing the results of our kind of high certainty investment choices across all the categories that you know very well and that we highlighted on the outlook page for expenses, and those continue to be the main areas of focus. The execution gets tweaked at the margin as we pursue different opportunities in the Commercial & Investment Bank. We continue drilling down and analyzing into the relative pockets of weakness that you might see if you go a level or two below the very significantly strong share positions that you see on an aggregate level.

"Hi. Simple and then more difficult, I guess. Jamie, who's your successor? And then the second question is, I know I asked the question at Investor Day, why not stay as CEO a little bit longer? I think what I'm hearing from investors now, it goes up and down, but I think investors would like you to stay. So, why say you're going to stay less than five years? You're finally getting what you wanted, 15 years, your spaghetti chart about the regulatory structure and the unpredictability of capital requirements and regulatory costs, and it seems like you're finally getting what you've been playing for. So, why not stay around a bit longer if investors want you to do so? And what would you do otherwise anyway? You don't play golf. You aren't going to be Treasury Secretary. Seems like your work is your hobby, right? So how much longer would you stay around?","I do love what I do. And answering the second question first, look, we're on a path. The path is not just about me, it's about the other senior people in the company. It's about the Board. If I'm here for several more years, and I may or may not be Chairman. That's going to be up to the Board. Does it really fit the new CEO and stuff like that? You're talking potentially four, five years or more. I'll be 69 in March. I think it's the rational thing to do. I've had a couple health problems, you know.

I think it's wonderful that Jenn Piepszak, who does not want to be the CEO, will be here as Chief Operating Officer and stay after that. So, obviously, she's going to work with those people which I think is great for a company, just having continuity of management and leadership, and will be one of those people. And obviously, we're not going to tell the press, but it's not determined yet.

So, maybe just talk about, again, what areas of the regulatory structure, if it were to change, would be most impactful for you. And is there any areas where you think capital requirements could actually go down? Or is this more of a story of requirements just simply stop going up? Thanks.","Hey, Jim.

But I could go down some pretty deep rabbit holes speculating on all the different parts of the framework and how they could evolve, and I just don't really think that's productive right now. But let me make some attempt to answer your question. So, backing up a second, if you read Jamie's quotes, they're very consistent with what we've been saying as a company for a long time, which is that all we want is a coherent, rational, holistically-assessed regulatory framework that allows banks to do their job, supporting the economy, that isn't reflexively anti-bank, that doesn't default to the answer to every question being more of",Analyst,CFO,2025,JPMorgan,Q4_2024,1,0.8804,1_the_you_and_that,Interest Rate Risk,Interest Rate Risk,2024-12-31,Q4_2024,Market Risk,Positive
"Yeah. No, that makes sense. And maybe just as a follow-up, just on loan growth. Have you – since the election, it seems like CEO confidence, business confidence has increased. So, are you starting to see any improvement in demand on lending? Just any thoughts there would be great.","Yeah, it's a good question. And I think given the significant improvement in business sentiment and the general optimism out there, you might have expected to see some pickup in loan growth. We are not really seeing that. I don't particularly think that's a negative. I think it's probably explained by a combination of wide-open capital markets, and so many of the larger corporates accessing the capital markets and healthy balance sheets in small businesses and maybe some residual caution. And maybe there are some pockets and some industries where some aspects of the policy uncertainty that we might be facing are making them a little bit more cautious than they otherwise would be about what they're executing in the near-term.

"So, as we think about the definition of excess, right, because part of this is like 15.7% is clearly a huge number. So, as we think about your returns going forward, the definition of excess also continues to shift. So, how should we think about those crosscurrents in terms of two big components, clearly, one is your Global Systemically Important Banks surcharge and the other is your stress capital buffer?","Right, Erika. Okay. You are tempting me with many rabbit holes that are very deep. But let's try and address this not too much great length. First of all, Global Systemically Important Banks. So, yes, it was a high print in the third quarter, but we had normal seasonality third quarter and fourth quarter. So, while our current view of Global Systemically Important Banks number is an estimate, we're quite confident that we wound up comfortably in the 5% bucket just as a result of normal seasonality. It was actually a relatively quiet December in terms of the types of year-end things that sometimes create pressures of various types.

"And just a follow-up question – a follow-up to John's line of questioning. As a placeholder, as we think about what you said, trying to arrest the growth of Common Equity Tier 1, for now, should we just assume that anything that you don't need for organic growth and your dividend obligations in terms of that 15.7% will be bought back by the company as we think about? I know you don't want to predict the buyback, but is that sort of just a placeholder for now as we think about what can return back to shareholders in the form of repurchase?","Yeah.

"Good morning. It seems like you guys have backed off the view that you're materially over-earning on net interest income. And is this all because of the higher rate environment that's expected now? Or is it also partly a different view on deposit pricing, specifically on the consumer side, which I think you had assumed it would reprice a bit more than we've seen?","Yeah, it's a good question, Matt. I guess maybe let me try to frame this from a couple different perspectives. So, on the one hand, you're right. If you look at the Net Interest Income guidance that we're giving you, including the notion that subject to the yield curve panning out in line with the current forwards, which, as we know, is the one thing that we know won't happen. But if you want to assume something, if you assume the forwards, we're sort of telling you that we might return to sequential growth in the back half of the year, again, based on all of our current assumptions, all else being equal.

"Guys, can you hear me okay? All right. Just want to make sure you can hear me. So this has been a great call. First, congratulations on a great quarter. It's been a great call with a lot of robust questions here. You're like, what else is there to ask? Here's my question. As we think about the Net Interest Income outlook and you highlighted the Net Interest Margin pressure, but loan – but basically, balance is increasing here, right? Maybe you could just speak to – could you help me understand the order of the drivers? Is it QT going away, deposits going up, punch it into securities? Is it loan growth inflecting? Is there any place in the franchise where you see loan growth opportunities for inflection this coming year? And then lastly, as I think about your comments around you've got the green market share number one, you've got the yellow, you've got the red, places maybe we can't see. Could you help us understand where those yellows and reds are – where they are? Are they just scattered, everybody – every single business has one? Or are there some that have more than others and, therefore, more opportunities? And is it more balance sheet or fee-generative? That's kind of what I'd like to just discuss if you have a minute. Thanks.","Sure. Yeah, let me take a crack at that, Betsy. So, loan growth, I think looking for areas where it might inflect, the only thing I can think of, frankly, that would be in that category, certainly in terms of being meaningful to the company's performance, would be acquisition finance because that's been relatively muted as a a function of the Mergers & Acquisitions environment, and if that picks up you could see more there. Now, those aren't loans that we necessarily keep on the balance sheet for that long, so whether that shows up in fees or Net Interest Income or whatever, it's a separate issue.",Analyst,CFO,2025,JPMorgan,Q4_2024,1,0.9198,1_the_you_and_that,Profitability,Profitability,2024-12-31,Q4_2024,Other,Positive

"Good morning. I guess just two questions. In terms of areas of vulnerability, so I heard you, Jeremy, on the lending side, but lots of crosscurrents. Like, if we anchor to the fact that you have a new administration that's taking place or take office with a focus on domestic CapEx. Even if we don't get any rates cut, when you look through your customer base where do you see areas of vulnerability, be it because of tariffs, be it because of just lack of any additional relief from the Fed? Yeah, would love to hear just from a credit quality perspective what no rate cuts might mean.","Oh, I see where your question is. That took me a second. Yeah, I mean, look, wholesale credit is pretty hard to predict. It tends to be very idiosyncratic. You obviously know that we're coming out of a 10-plus year period of an exceptionally low charge-off rate, and so at some point that has to normalize to a slightly more reasonable level, a little bit to Jamie's comments earlier about how some things are still not fully normalized, and arguably wholesale credit could be one of those. We do run extensive stress tests on the sensitivities to the portfolio – of the portfolio to rate shock. A lot of what we do from an underwriting perspective is designed to protect us from that, frankly. So, you can rest assured that we're running the relevant analysis, but I'm not inclined to go into detail on any given sector or whatever.

"And I guess – thanks for that. Just sticking with that, as far as QT is concerned, when you talk to experts, like no one knows where the right level for the Fed to end is. I'm just wondering if you have any thoughts there on when Fed should end the pressure on the system, and what it may imply for deposit growth?","Yeah. I think the conventional wisdom on QT, and I'm not pretending to add to the conventional wisdom one way or the other, is that the tapering should sort of complete and, therefore, we might see an end sometime in the middle of the year. Of course, they may change that, but that seems to be the current market consensus. And when we sort of take a step back and look at the H.8 data and our kind of flow of funds models and that type of stuff, when you look at the way our peers are behaving, evolution of QT, expectations for economy-wide loan growth, et cetera, and what the impact of that might be on the growth of system-wide deposits, it's kind of consistent with the story that we're telling about sort of the background growth in our Net Interest Income outlook, plus or minus, what happens with the policy rate and stabilizing and growing deposit balances through the second half of the year.",Analyst,CFO,2025,JPMorgan,Q4_2024,1,0.9802,1_the_you_and_that,Macroeconomic Risk,Macroeconomic Risk,2024-12-31,Q4_2024,Macro Risk,Positive

I’ll have to take a look at that data. I don't actually recognize those numbers. But I can speak for ourselves, which is that when we look at the encouraging growth that we see in our checking franchise, it's a couple of things.

So you did see people moving money out of checking into higher-yielding alternatives over the course of the last couple of years in the rate cycle.

I wanted to better understand how you're balancing investment needs with goal of delivering continued profitability?","The margin came down largely because you had to sort of incremental hit to the investment side revenue as the markets fell year-over-year, but we'd expect that margin to move back up to its more traditional 20%, 25% to 30%.",Analyst,CEO,2023,Bank of America,Q1_2023,1,0.0,1_the_you_and_that,Profitability,Profitability,2023-03-31,Q1_2023,Other,Neutral

You've got -- first quarter is just normally a seasonal build for us, so that happens, and a little bit of borrow.

If the rate environment does shift and, maybe, we do start to see lower rates by the end of the year, how quickly can you guys move this from being asset sensitive to neutral or a liability sensitive on the balance sheet?","Well, I think, if you were to take that same metric on the downside, it would be -- probably, be down $3.6 billion for down 100, just to give some idea. And what's happening now is, obviously, as the interest-bearing piece just continues to rise across the company, we've got a hedge now as rates, if and when they start to go back down, it won't be a complete hedge, but it'll be a little bit of a hedge there.

I'm wondering how you're thinking about the Net Interest Income trajectory on a year [Inaudible]? I believe Net Interest Income is down about 3% year-on-year in 1Q.

How much do you think about extending duration and managing the swaps a little differently, as we eventually knew at this time transition to a different rate backdrop?","Yes. So Glenn, I mean, ultimately, we'll use the same philosophy and strategy that we do to this point. We are in, obviously, a very good position where we have substantial deposits in excess of loans.

Or are there any leading indicators that would lead you to believe we can get back to a little bit more normal BofA loan growth and not have to wait two years for it?","Yes. Well, I think we're probably getting closer now because, remember, in a big macro, we're in that transition period where post-pandemic, the economy is sort of recovering and rates are settling in and it's changing people's behaviors.

"Maybe just a quick follow-up, and I don't mean to beat a dead horse on Net Interest Income, but can we just -- can you just help us think through the puts and takes on -- you have rate cuts at the end of the year, forward curve implies more next year. As that cumulative impact starts to hit next year, what -- I guess what gives you confidence that this is sort of the trough? What are all the puts and takes that we should think about in how we model the Net Interest Income for next year when we think about the forward curve and that impact?","Jim, I think this bridge probably is all the right inputs for any given year.

"How are you thinking about the growth trajectory from here, I guess, as we think about -- is it -- does it accelerate with rate cuts in your view? What are the dynamics are you thinking about as sort of returning to that historical kind of mid-single-digit deposit growth within BofA and the industry?","Well, I think Brian covered Slide 4.

I'll start with a simple question. You mentioned loan spreads have improved. Why is that? Where is that? Do you expect that to continue?,"Loan spreads have improved for us, Mike, over the course of the past, I think it's now 8 or 9 quarters. It's primarily in the commercial businesses. And it's largely because we have to price the balance sheet for the returns that our shareholders expect.",Analyst,CFO,2024,Bank of America,Q2_2024,1,0.4767,1_the_you_and_that,Liquidity Risk,Liquidity Risk,2024-06-30,Q2_2024,Liquidity Risk,Positive
What is a normal Net Interest Margin? I mean you were 2.5% in 2017. You were 3.0% in 2004. And I know the composition has changed and everything. But what's normal Net Interest Margin? And what do you think is a normal return on tangible common equity through the cycle?,"So I'd say right now, in terms of the 1.93%, we feel like we are underearning. We feel like that number is going to go up over time. It will go up as net interest income goes up. But additionally, I think the balance sheet is likely to stay kind of flattish here. So the numerator is going to grow. The denominator is going to stay pretty tight here. So we think we're underearning there. We think through a cycle, we've got to get back to a more normal number like 2.30-ish over time. That takes a while. It's a grind, Mike, quarter after quarter.

"Okay. And then just I wasn't clear. You said net charge-offs in the second half should be less than the first half, and I wasn't sure if that related to cards or I wasn't sure what...","Mike, that was me. And basically, what I'm saying is you’ve plateaued in terms of the delinquencies, which means the second half is pretty well determined, as you know, because it's just a march from 30 to 60 to 90 to 180. And it will be -- the charge-off rate will be flattish. We're kind of back to normal at 3.80% or so. That's -- we underwrite to actually have a higher charge-off rate, quite frankly, in that intolerance, but that 3 80 is kind of where we see it since, 3.80%.",Analyst,CEO,2024,Bank of America,Q2_2024,1,0.5187,1_the_you_and_that,Asset Quality and Credit Risk,Asset Quality and Credit Risk,2024-06-30,Q2_2024,Credit Risk,Positive

"And just given multiple sources of Net Interest Margin improvement, looking beyond '24, how should we think about the pace of Net Interest Margin build as we -- I know it's a longer timeline to get to the 2.30% to 2.40%, but just how to think about the expectations around the Net Interest Margin trajectory beyond '24.","Well, your first point is a question of can we pay down some of the higher-cost securities? The answer to that is yes. And that would be an expectation of ours as part of this. We've got some shorter-dated CDs that can roll off. We can replace those or not.

"Yes, another question on Net Interest Income. Alastair, I did, I think, hear you correctly when you said that as you go into the second half of '25, there's going to be incremental benefits coming from swap roll off. Did I hear that right?","Yes, that's right. Second half of '25. So as we get closer, we'll be able to give you some kind of bridge like this that allows you to see what that looks like.

"Yes, for sure. But I'm just wondering, is there anything that's -- I guess what I just would like to understand a little better is how the swap book is impacting Slide 10. And then is it gradual into the second half of '25? Or is it a switch on in 3Q? Just to understand how the swap book is playing into this.","Yes. So the part that's important for Slide 10 around the second half of this year is just the BSBY piece. It's not from cash flow swaps. Any cash flow swaps we have to roll off in the course of the next 12 months really, they're all kind of current coupon-ish, because anything that we did there was to do with LIBOR-cessation or whatever, and so they all got re-couponed. So I wouldn't worry about that.",Analyst,CFO,2024,Bank of America,Q2_2024,1,0.7339,1_the_you_and_that,Liquidity Risk,Liquidity Risk,2024-06-30,Q2_2024,Liquidity Risk,Positive

We're essentially using 4 variables. We're thinking: what will the loan growth be? What will the deposit growth look like? What will be the rotation between noninterest-bearing and interest-bearing? And what will be any pricing changes we need to make, right? Then rotation and pricing are pretty closely -- you can call it the same thing.

"And when I look at Table 40 from your Q, in both a parallel shift and a steepener scenario, down 100 is negative to net interest income. Is it because this is a 12-month look? And like you pointed out in the second half of '25, you have underwater cash flow hedges that are rolling off. In other words, as we go through 2025, do you get less asset sensitive? And additionally, what is the notional on those cash flow hedges that you're talking about?",Yes. So the asset sensitivity that we disclosed is meant to give a sense for what happens if nothing changes. It's totally static.

And how much of that starts rolling off in the second half of 2025?,"Well, I’d think about it like this. You can almost think about it like it's like $10 billion or so every quarter. It's just that the ones that roll off for the first -- next 12 months, they're all kind of current coupon so they won't really have any impact. Once you get into the second half of 2025, they're a little bit lower rated. So that's when you begin to get some benefit there.

"And I'm wondering if you could carry out the balance sheet efficiency with -- and keep your balance sheet flattish.

I'm wondering if that's the right math to do, or should we expect some shrinkage of the balance sheet if you can -- that's part of the path for?","Yes. I think what will happen is the underlying growth of the company will still be there.

And how much are those pay-fixed swaps currently in the money and kind of like how you're just thinking about that side of the portfolio as well?","Yes. Just remember, those have received-fixed. So remember, start -- that there. You remember that is when we put the Available for Sale in our portfolio, it's so that we've got a group of securities that are sitting there. They're typically treasuries. We swap them to floating so that they look like they're cash as far as we're concerned. We don't have to worry about impact then to regulatory capital flowing through.

Okay. And then how do you manage that going forward with regards to like the rate forecast?

Okay. And a quick one on expenses. I believe you said that costs are kind of hanging here at around the $16.3 billion that was reported. And so just kind of put any color on puts and takes here. Just is that better kind of revenue-related comp against your ongoing efficiencies and just how do you think about longer-term expense growth again?,"Sure, Ken. I think honestly, the second quarter is sort of emblematic. If you think about last year's second quarter and this year's second quarter, we went up by $300 billion -- $300 million, excuse me.

Could you tell us how you expect to price your deposits as rates continue to fall? With this excess deposit level, can you be more aggressive in lowering your deposit costs?","I think that's very business- and, more importantly, customer-specific views, Gerard. So we think our deposit strategies in the context of how our customers utilize our services.

I think that's the first time in maybe over 2 or 3 years. Was there a new program? Or what are you seeing that drives that? And should that -- or can that continue as we go forward into '25?","Yes.

Is that truly slowing or -- and talk to it a little bit by customer segment, if you can, please?","Yes. I think the fact, you're catching two things. First one is, it is slowing.

"And then I guess one last piece, I was thinking is the remixing of the balance sheet. That's been commented kind of throughout this call, over time probably causes a little creep in RWAs, right, like loans higher than, say, securities. So lots of excess capital, but some puts and takes. And how are you thinking about it between now and when we get final guidelines?","So first off, I think we always want to use the capital to grow the business.

But can you just kind of discuss your thoughts on that and perhaps the outlook on deposit pricing in general?","Yeah. I mean, Jim, one of the things that I think gives us some confidence around Net Interest Income troughing and then growing in the back half of next year is if you think -- we've seen the last Fed hike or you believe that the last Fed hike is a month from now or two months from now.

"Good morning. First, just to clarify, what's driving the drop in net interest income from 3Q to 4Q? Is that core net interest income? Or is that on the market side?","Well, you're talking about the fact that we think that we're going to be around $14-or-so billion in Q4. I'd say, first onet zero is you've got a little bit of deposit pricing lag there. So we got to keep thinking about that.

"If we get higher for longer rates, there's no cuts. Is that good or bad versus the guidance that you gave earlier? Obviously, you've got puts and takes, so some reinvestment on the asset side. But again, coming back to the deposit funding issue, I think there's a view that higher for longer eventually drives up the consumer rates. So what would be the net of those two in the higher for longer?","Well, hire for longer is going to be better. So you're right, we've got the forward curve and our expectation that doesn't turn out to be the case, we'd expect Net Interest Income would be higher.",Analyst,CFO,2023,Bank of America,Q3_2023,1,0.7906,1_the_you_and_that,Interest Rate Risk,Interest Rate Risk,2023-09-30,Q3_2023,Market Risk,Positive
And that's simply the assets repricing more on the deposits? Or are you still thinking there's minimal consumer deposit and pricing even in the higher for longer?,"It will be both. I mean there'll be the repricing for sure. And in addition, we'd expect to capture a little bit of margin from any short-term rate hike.",Analyst,CFO,2023,Bank of America,Q3_2023,1,0.3182,1_the_you_and_that,Liquidity Risk,Liquidity Risk,2023-09-30,Q3_2023,Liquidity Risk,Positive
"Yeah. I was hoping you could give a little color on what you're seeing on credit. Your outlook as you look at roll rates and migrations, how are you thinking about the trajectory of charge-offs in the near term?","Well, John, I'll just point out, you can see the trajectory we've laid it out on the slide. Most of the net charge-off increase over time has been really due to card and consumer card. And the charge-offs at this point are still lower than they were in the fourth quarter of '19, which was a stellar period.

"Got it. And one bigger picture question as you think about the Basel III and the opportunity to mitigate and optimize. Does a 15% Return on Average Common Equity feel like a good aspiration for the company over time, Brian, through the cycle? I mean recognizing that's where you are already today. But as you factor in the potential for new rules, anything about that?","Yeah. So I think if we're doing on -- I think a simple way to think about it is we're doing on $194 million of capital, which we did it this quarter. And that is -- you need about another, say, $10 billion to put a buffer on the end state need, $10 billion to $11 billion-plus, 0.5%, which is our normal buffer without any mitigation.",Analyst,CEO,2023,Bank of America,Q3_2023,1,0.296,1_the_you_and_that,Capital Adequacy,Capital Adequacy,2023-09-30,Q3_2023,Capital Risk,Positive

So if rates stay higher are better, are you implying that rate cuts would therefore be negative for you from an Net Interest Income standpoint?","Yeah.

And is that because your assets -- you have that many floating rate assets that would reprice faster than you can cut funding costs?,"Yeah.

And can you kind of help us understand like what the kind of all-in yield is on that book? And if you would still also have repricing help going forward on that book as well as I mentioned earlier on the Held to Maturity maturities?","Yeah. So most of the book we swapped to floating.

"Got it. That's helpful detail. So I guess just in terms of deposit growth from here, would you still prefer to grow deposits in line with loans? Or is there a little bit more room for that to come down?","We prefer to grow deposits in line with customer growth and activity. So in the last four quarters, in consumer, I think we're up another 900,000 net new checking accounts, not -- which average balance is around $11,000. They come in at lower than that, mature up to that.

"Thanks. Brian, trading has grown nicely in equities. You've had -- you said it was led by financing. Is there room in your balance sheet from a capital standpoint to keep growing that? And second question related to trading would be, in your guidance on Net Interest Income for next year, what are you seeing for trading Net Interest Income in there?","Let me just hit the first one, and Alastair can get the second one. The capacity, think about the constraint on Risk-Weighted Assets, as you know, Vivek and your experience business, that equity financing is not Risk-Weighted Assets intense. So -- but it is asset size intense. Now when you look at us with our spot leverage ratio, 100-plus points over the requirements, we have lots of room on the asset side.",Analyst,CEO,2023,Bank of America,Q3_2023,1,0.7754,1_the_you_and_that,Profitability,Profitability,2023-09-30,Q3_2023,Other,Positive
"I guess I'll ask the Net Interest Income question, Alastair. You talked about still feel comfortable troughing in the second quarter; poised to grow. So can you maybe give us a little bit more on -- based on the forward curve, any kind of rough thinking on how the trajectory from here beyond 4Q? And what kind of growth you may be thinking about in '25? Just any kind of bigger than a bread box conversation would be helpful.","I think if we went back to 3 quarters ago, we sort of saw this trough appearing in the second quarter. And we felt like as the deposits were beginning to find a floor, we'd be in a position where we could begin to see Net Interest Income grow. So obviously, that happened in Q3.

"Okay. That's helpful. And maybe just a follow-up on the deposit question. You guys had really strong growth in net new checking accounts, but Consumer deposits still shrinking a little bit. Do you see any change in behavior since the rate cuts? Or how are you thinking about Consumer deposit growth and Wealth too? I guess we're seeing commercial growth, but sort of those other pieces on the retail side that have yet to sort of inflect. How are you thinking about that?","If you look across the last several weeks, the Wealth Management has basically been flat at that $280-odd billion level, Jim.

"Just to follow up on this last thread of questions. Two things, one, the deposits. How much do you feel that the rate environment has impacted you in terms of the deposit growth that you've generated here and the degree of shrinkage rate that you've seen in some of the businesses? Is it rate driven, do you think?","I guess, Betsy, at the end of the day, you remember that we've grown deposits for 4 straight quarters. What is rate driven is at the margin, consumer customers that have $300,000, $500,000 have moved -- have less in their deposit counts, honestly, than pre-pandemic when the aggregate holes up, so think about that -- the constant customers that have been with us since then.

"Right. And I know last quarter, we were talking a lot about the sweeps and that whole pricing dynamic. Anything this quarter to say about that reflecting on how you indicated in the slide. You're at 3.13%, it came down 1 basis point. I mean it's like de minimis, right?

"Okay. And then the other question I had just was on the Global Banking. Alastair, you mentioned that corporate loan demand picked up late in the quarter. Maybe you could give us some color on what's driving that? Is that mainly a function of the Mergers & Acquisitions picking up and the legs that you see to that demand would be really helpful to understand.","Yes. So look, we've obviously seen pretty modest loan growth over the course of the past year, and it's modest loan growth that we've put in our forward Net Interest Income guidance. But we were pleased to see a little bit more loan growth at the end of the quarter there. That's why you see the balances up a little more end of period than perhaps the prior quarter.

"Hi. Thank you. One quickie follow-up on the Net Interest Income front. I'm just curious, current duration of the securities portfolio and maybe a fixed and floating mix split, and how you're thinking about that short duration as the forward curve starts to play out?","Yes. So not a great deal of change, Glenn, for us in terms of the securities portfolio from what we said before. Obviously, the hold-to-maturity continues to run off.

"Yes. Good color. I appreciate it. Wanted to maybe get a little bit more color -- in the opening remarks, you mentioned the tenth straight quarter of quarter-on-quarter improvements in markets revenue. It's clear you could see. Can you remind us exactly where you've been investing the lion's share of both people and balance sheet and is that an ongoing process that we can -- obviously, we can't get a core every single quarter. But meaning, is this an ongoing capital effort to continue to boost results across Markets.","Yes. Well, look, we pointed out before, and I think you see it again in our results this quarter. If you look at the organic growth highlights on Page 3, you'll see pretty good growth in each of our 4 big segments. Markets is no different in that regard relative to the other 3 in that we continue to invest in that business.

You did $3.5 million this quarter, obviously, generated a lot of capital, had excess capital and sort of the outlook for loan growth is for some, but not a ton, so.","No change to the capital strategy. Obviously, what's become very clear over the course of the past year is we've got the capital. So we built the capital over time to make sure that we were in a good position for Basel III final as originally proposed if it were put together today. And we have the time to build more over time because after dividend, you're talking about 30 basis points of capital generation every quarter. So we're waiting at this point to see the final rules as they come out.

"Okay. And then just a different topic. You guys have talked about this concept of the normalized net interest margin of about 2.3%, looking out a couple or a few years. Any updates on the timing of that? And then I think a lot of that is being driven by the fixed-rate asset repricing. But how the lower rates impact it? Can you reach that level with the current forward curve, for example?","Yes. Well, look, the most important thing is we've got to get back to growing Net Interest Income, and we've been saying that now for 3 quarters believing that Q2 would be the trough. So we demonstrated the growth this quarter. We're in a good position to do it again next quarter. And we're on the path.

"I guess I'm asking the same question each quarter, but it's because the efficiency ratio seems to be getting worse.

So much more of a digital company. And then we look at Slide 10 and your efficiency ratio is 65% versus 64% last quarter versus 63% a year ago with non-comp expense up this quarter. So when do we get back to those days when we count the number of quarters of consecutive positive operating leverage and kind of what's the disconnect here?","Yes. Okay. So look, that's what we're focused on is getting back to that operating leverage, Mike. The pressure right now is coming largely from incentive comp related to the fee businesses. So think about sales and trading up 12%, investment banking up 18%, asset management up 14%. If you look at wealth management alone, we're talking about $200 million there just in that segment alone.

Can you give us a sneak preview for next year on what you're thinking just because it's been a little bit of a slog, admittedly, with the headwind from Net Interest Income.","Yes. Well, look, I think, again, this is one of those things where we got to see the deposits turnaround in all of the businesses, and we got to make sure that we've got the Net Interest Income trajectory. We kind of feel like that's going to be a 2025 operating leverage question, and we'll be able to update you, I think, with some precision as we get into the fourth quarter.

Can you talk through the other pieces that you had on that slide as the slide was not this quarter?","Yes. I think if you were to look -- we haven't updated it here because we're trying to get a 6-month forward view back at the time, and it was just helpful to do it that way.

And as it turns out, we all know that there were two cuts in September. That extra cut flows all the way through the fourth quarter. It's not just 2 weeks in the quarter or 6 weeks; it’s the full quarter. So that's an additional headwind, if you like.

"Perfect. And then just another quick follow-up on the securities portfolio. I know you guys are seeing some repricing tailwinds there, but have you ever given any thought on like doing a bigger repositioning action, just because the market seems to be responding favorably to some similar actions of some of your peers?","Well at this stage, we don't see any need for that. Remember, most of our securities in the available for sale, we've got those held at this point in treasury swap to floating. And we feel like if you look at the Net Interest Income sensitivity of the company over time, it's come down with the composition of our portfolio.

"I appreciate that you want to wait until January, Alastair, to give us Net Interest Income update, given how much is changing or how much has been changing in the curve. So maybe I'm going to ask this this way. You've talked about hedges in the past in terms of the sensitivity of your floating-rate loans, specifically in commercial. As we think about forecasting for whatever rate curve turns out and you think about your floating-rate loans ex. card, should we assume a similar sensitivity on the way down as on the way up, excluding BSBY or will the hedges essentially give you some floor in that your sensitivity to repricing going forward, again ex. BSBY, is not as significant as it was on the way up.","Yes. So I think it's okay to start with the same sensitivity on the way down is up because the company is, largely speaking, positioned in the same way. At the same time, you put your finger on it, we are going to benefit from repricing over time. And we mentioned last quarter, and we've talked about already on this call, the fact that we've got the various securities and the various new originations that replace those loans that are maturing.",Analyst,CFO,2024,Bank of America,Q3_2024,1,0.8428,1_the_you_and_that,Interest Rate Risk,Interest Rate Risk,2024-09-30,Q3_2024,Market Risk,Positive
"And my follow-up question is, clearly, you have one of the best views on deposit behavior in the U.S. And it's been so long since we've seen a neutral rate that's not 0. So I guess a two-part question. The first is, should we similarly assume the same ability to recapture on deposit repricing on the way down as it was on the way up in terms of the same deposit beta? And as we think about 2025, it may have better loan growth, where do you think if we -- if our neutral rate is 2.75%, 3.00%; where does Bank of America's natural deposit costs fall relative to that?","Erika, I think much discussion over the last couple of years about betas and everything. But if you look, we sort of stand at the end of the third quarter, the difference between Fed funds and the total interest-bearing cost of our deposits is around 250 -- almost 260 basis points.

Alastair, you touched on the Basel in one of your comments regarding how you're in a good position from your capital standpoint from the original proposal. Can you give us any color on what you guys have seen from that presentation that Vice Chair Barr gave earlier quarter, what your views are, where you might come in. I think they said there was an average increase of capital for the group of about 9% and how you might stack up against that?","Yes. I'm not sure we have enough detail, Gerard, to give you a specific at this point. When the reproposal comes out, what we're told is it will not only be about it repropose the whole entire picture, including the changes outlined in Vice Chair Barr’s speech, but you could take it for granted that, that was more favorable than the original proposal.

"I see. And Brian, do you think that could step up your activity of returning more capital as it comes in better than expected, you would take that as an opportunity maybe to return more capital to shareholders?","In the end of the day, we have excess capital based on the estimates of the old one. So yes, it would at the margin. But remember that at the end of the day, Gerard, we are sending capital back to shareholders because of the fact that the franchise generates activity without using a ton of capital and grows its loans, its deposits, the earnings, et cetera. So we will continue to be discipline with the capital and the capital return, and we'll continue to return more of it if more is available.

"OK. That's fair. Maybe just as a follow-up. Just on loan growth, what do you think -- we all see the card growth, but outside of that it's been pretty muted. We're looking at rate cuts. Maybe that's a little bit better for demand. How do you think -- what are you seeing on the commercial side in terms of demand?

So, if you think about it, pre-pandemic, we reached a point where we'd taken expenses down a place where you said we'd kind of grow, you know, sort of half the rate of inflation, etc. So, you're right, it -- what we're thinking now is we're up $100 million in the fourth quarter of last year's fourth quarter.",Analyst,CEO,2024,Bank of America,Q4_2023,1,0.3818,1_the_you_and_that,Profitability,Profitability,2023-12-31,Q4_2023,Other,Positive

So, you know, the rate cuts that are in the forward projections, the earliest one comes March, for example.

And does that acceleration in Net Interest Income you cited for the second half continue into '26 given some of those tailwinds should remain in place beyond '25?","Well, first of all, I admire you asking about '26. I'm always reluctant to talk about the back half of '25. So I'll leave '26 for another time. But we don't have a whole lot of news, Steven, relative to what we talked about in the prior quarters. We're obviously pointing right now to deposit growth in particular because it's beginning to get back to something more normal. There was a period there where deposit balances were declining as people got back to something more normal in their accounts. But we're highlighting here: Consumer found its floor in August, Wealth found its floor in July. And that's giving some support then as we grow deposits. That's helping us with the Net Interest Income growth. So that hasn't changed.

"That's great, Alastair. And maybe a follow-up for Brian. Just at a recent conference, you spoke about the expectation of delivering 200 Basis Points of sustainable operating leverage, laying out an algorithm where revenues grow 4% to 5%, expenses grow 2% to 3%. What gives you confidence in that ability to deliver that level of top-line growth on a sustainable basis? Just want to unpack that a little bit further.","So I think what gives us confidence, we have periods with stable rate environments, a stable economy, growing at a slower rate than it is now. And having produced that for 5 years in a row, I think it was by quarters or something like that. And so it's not something we haven't done. But if you think about the current environment, what's driving is different. Our revenue growth is growing at twice that rate plus and the expense growth is growing close to that number. But when you get to higher growth rates, especially where it's coming from Wealth Management business, market-based business, businesses in investment banking, it attaches a higher sort of instantaneous expense. And yet it still produces even a little bit of operating leverage at a higher growth rate, a good after-tax, a good Earnings per Share result, a good net operating income results. So there's different times, different models. This is a model where revenue is growing faster than it might grow all the time in more normalized environments, but the business is coming from are those businesses which have the quickest move relative to expense.",Analyst,CEO,2025,Bank of America,Q4_2024,1,0.9919,1_the_you_and_that,Profitability,Profitability,2024-12-31,Q4_2024,Other,Positive

"Now in terms of capital, how are you thinking about the Common Equity Tier 1 target and the buffer that feels appropriate in this environment? And how does that play into your thinking on buybacks?","So I think we bought $3.5 billion this quarter. We'd expect to continue to step back the highest levels, we are in the money, we pay the dividend, we invest in the growth of the business, and then we use the rest of buyback stock. That was $3.5 billion in the past couple of quarters.

"Okay. Does that leave you towards a mid-teens Return on Average Tangible Common Equity target, Brian, as Net Interest Margin normalizes and capital normalizes?","Yes. I think the capital normalization will be more sort of holding that capital to grow through it and not have to retain more capital for growth, frankly, if there's math that helps us favor it. But the Net Interest Margin is probably more critical to move the yield from sub-2% this quarter -- 2% this quarter to 2.10%+ at the end of the fourth quarter and then moving from there. That, as you know, is -- all that flows to the bottom line. So we'll continue to drive the Return on Average Tangible Common Equity back up as -- if you look back in the areas where there was any front-end -- Fed funds was 2%. We were running a couple of hundred basis points more. It's the huge zero-interest deposit base, especially in consumer and low-interest deposit base that provides a lot of leverage. So that will be a driver. The capital return would help some, but I think that will be more complex based on all the different rules and what happens.",Analyst,CEO,2025,Bank of America,Q4_2024,1,0.9176,1_the_you_and_that,Profitability,Profitability,2024-12-31,Q4_2024,Other,Positive

This is where you got, Glenn, you got to kind of get away from reserve-setting methodologies versus what we really believe is from our research team and your research team, your economist research team would tell you. Our core assumption is the Gross Domestic Product grows in the low 2s this year. The unemployment stays between 4.1% and I think -- maybe gets up to 4.3%, something like that. So this is literally a weighting of a base case, which would match that and an adverse case and some other cases just in the way we build methodologies for the reserves because you're reserving for uncertain future, and that's how it has it.

And I'm just wondering if the forward curve or what the dynamics are that would lay out the path to achieve that over the medium term?","If the Fed funds rate stays higher, we'll get there faster is the simple -- because that's obvious because the sheer volume of low-interest. So if we were sitting here in the October, I think when we're talking about that – the amount of rate cuts was still, I don't know how many more -- 3 or 4 more than we've had so far – and now we're down to 1.

"So you kind of upped your Net Interest Income guide for the next several quarters. And this was the first question asked. But how much is short rate? How much is long rate?

And what's the sensitivity for every 10 basis points of additional steepness that add how much Net Interest Income or something along those lines?","So Mike, it's still the short term that drives probably 90% of the sensitivity around Net Interest Income. Because if you think about it, we just don't have enough fixed-rate assets repricing to really drive Net Interest Income. In any given quarter, you've got a few billion of resi mortgage, a few billion of CVL repricing – let’s call that $10 billion to $12 billion. You've got $8 billion to $10 billion of hold-to-maturity securities repricing. But that's in the context of a $3.3 trillion balance sheet.

"Maybe just dialing in on the deposit growth. You clearly have been outperforming the peer group. But maybe I just want to focus on Consumer for a second. You generated $1.1 million of net new checking accounts, which seems best among peers. I think that's showing up in better Consumer deposit growth in 4Q. So what do you think you're doing differently that's generating that kind of consistent success in adding new accounts?","Look, at the end of the day, our brand is best received in terms of our scores, our customer service capabilities are scoring at the highest they've ever come. The fairness of our account structures of transparency, the digital capabilities, it's just winning in the market. It's a $1 billion net new checking accounts and not 92%, 90 -- whatever they are primary. They start with an average balance of 2,000 to 3,000. They move to 6,000, 7,000 over the course of 6 months. This is just a great job done by Dean Athanasia and Aron Levine and Holly O'Neill that run this business for us -- just continue to drive it.

"So what areas do you see sort of slowing on the expense side given your optimism on organic growth, how do you kind of decelerate the expense growth in '25?","I think three key things. One is if we get the year-over-year growth in the markets-related businesses, in the high double digits or 20% growth that expense guidance might be a little tight, but again, you would cheer for that. So this is assuming a 5% to 6% growth in the S&P-type of numbers. So that takes some of the growth pressure off. The aggregate numbers are locked in at a high level and growing merit.",Analyst,CEO,2025,Bank of America,Q4_2024,1,0.9501,1_the_you_and_that,Interest Rate Risk,Interest Rate Risk,2024-12-31,Q4_2024,Market Risk,Positive
"I have two separate questions. First one with expenses. Just want to clarify to the last question, Brian, what you said. So what are you assuming for incentive comp in '25 in your guidance? Is it flat year-on-year? Are you assuming some increase? Any color on that?","It will grow with the markets and stuff, but we have other efficiencies that offset some of that growth.",Analyst,CEO,2025,Bank of America,Q4_2024,1,0.7783,1_the_you_and_that,Interest Rate Risk,Interest Rate Risk,2024-12-31,Q4_2024,Market Risk,Positive
"Okay. Second one, I guess, I can't leave you disappointed. I must give you and Alastair love on Net Interest Income. So let me ask a little nitty question on that. BSBY hedges, since those started to accrete this quarter, how much was the benefit this quarter? And what is the cadence of that as we look out over '25?","So we think about the BSBY accreting back into the P&L, kind of like the same way we do with the other cash flow swaps, Vivek. So I'd say a couple of hundred this quarter. And then when we give you the guidance with all the cash flow swaps, it's all included in there.",Analyst,CFO,2025,Bank of America,Q4_2024,1,0.2975,1_the_you_and_that,Profitability,Profitability,2024-12-31,Q4_2024,Other,Positive
"Okay. So that 200 -- a couple of hundred million, that probably -- given that it's $1.6 billion to be recovered over a couple of years, that should continue at this pace all through '25 then, right? At least that particular item?",Most of it will take place in 2025. It sort of burns back into the P&L.

"And then -- sorry, if I may, another one. Brian, to your comment on capital you said you want to keep a 50-basis point buffer your Common Equity Tier 1, 11.9%, 50 basis point 11.2%. Is there a plan to go down to the 11.2% at some point and therefore step up your buyback? Or what's the thinking there?","I wouldn't assume that we're going to take it down through a lot of buybacks in your modeling. It's going to be there to support growth. But Vivek, the simple answer is we've got to get a set of rules to quit moving around on us. And once we get them, then we can give you better guidance on that. Because it's just hard to hard to estimate when you could have more excess if they do what -- we as an industry expect them to do. And then we have a different conversation. Right now, we we'll probably grow part of that away through the good work of our team in terms of loan growth and in the Markets business as we continue to invest in that business. So -- so don't expect us to deplete that ratio down quickly. But I'm holding my right to change that if we get the capital levels straightened out in the new rules.",Analyst,CEO,2025,Bank of America,Q4_2024,1,0.9109,1_the_you_and_that,Capital Adequacy,Capital Adequacy,2024-12-31,Q4_2024,Capital Risk,Positive
"Just if there was some relief on capital, are there areas that you would incrementally lean into? Obviously, without knowing all the rules, it's a charge to know for sure. But just other areas that you're like, if we have an extra 100 basis points, or 50 or 150, you would do a little bit more in some areas than you have been?","None of our businesses are constrained because of capital. So if the Consumer team had more credit card loan growth that was based on what they think the right risk balances and getting paid for it, et cetera. That's gone on. You saw us just grow balances last quarter, the auto loans, whatever. And so I think it -- I don't see that Wealth Management -- obviously, not much of an Risk-Weighted Assets users in a lot of ways. And then the real question is, in the Global Banking business, again, they're getting strong loan growth. There's nothing that we're slowing them down.",Analyst,CEO,2025,Bank of America,Q4_2024,1,0.7885,1_the_you_and_that,Interest Rate Risk,Interest Rate Risk,2024-12-31,Q4_2024,Market Risk,Positive
"And I guess, like depending on how the capital rules are tweaked, it could make some businesses just more profitable, right? So even though you have enough capital to put those businesses if the returns aren't making your hurdles, maybe it could with some tweaks. And I've heard some of your peers talk about like equity prime brokerage as one area that could have higher returns if capital requirements to reduce. And again, we don't know exactly how it's going to play out, but do you envision any kind of changes to how you evaluate businesses?","Yes. I think it won't change how we evaluate businesses because regulatory capital is only one of the ways we look at it, we look at the risk and sort of market-based capital and other things. But it could -- sort for lack of a better term, limit the penalty to some of these businesses down some. But -- but you also have to remember the ROA and the mix of businesses, and there's another side of this because we have 6% tangible common equity, and we got to produce returns on that and low ROA businesses affect that.",Analyst,CEO,2025,Bank of America,Q4_2024,1,-0.6652,1_the_you_and_that,Capital Adequacy,Capital Adequacy,2024-12-31,Q4_2024,Capital Risk,Negative
"When you guys look at credit quality, is it due to better underwriting standards or sticking to your underwriting standards, or is it your customers themselves because we all went through the pandemic are just much stronger balance sheets, more resilient. What would you account for so far that this credit cycle has been fairly benign for you and your peers?","Yes. Look, it's definitely been benign. I think one thing that hasn't changed, our underwriting strategy, our standards, our risk appetite our client selection, those really haven't changed, Gerard. But I think you're right. Look, things are obviously different than 2019. 2019, we didn't have this rate structure. So that's a little bit harder at the margin for the consumer. At the same time, the consumer is stronger. I mean, we can see that in the deposit balances. We can see it right now in the consumer spending in the 3% to 4% range. We can see it and the balances being elevated over 5 years ago.

"One of the risks -- I mean, when you guys sit down at night, everything is going well. What do you talk about is what curveballs do we have to watch out for? Is it a rate environment that changes quickly without anybody really expecting it? Is it complacency? What are some of the risks that you guys think about?","Well, you have wars and hopefully, a resolution of one that's just happening as we speak. But you have wars, you have trade wars, et cetera, that bothers. You have the availability of resource around the world, whether it's physical resource or human resource to do work, it’s shortages of that because unemployment rates a lot of countries are pretty low.

"No, that's very helpful.

"So Brian, here's the question. Small business optimism is up, and you've got a flat curve at the front end and -- and so I'm kind of wondering how that feeds into C&I demand? And I'm wondering what your conversations with not only small business, mid-business corporates, it'd be really interesting to hear how you think they're preparing for this change?","Sure, Betsy. So small business small, medium-sized businesses. So in our business banking category and -- we have Small Business, Business Banking, we have Global Commercial Bank, you think Middle Market. Across that environment, the draw rates and lines of credit stuff are still much lower than they were in a pre-pandemic and things like that.",Analyst,CEO,2025,Bank of America,Q4_2024,1,0.6369,1_the_you_and_that,Interest Rate Risk,Interest Rate Risk,2024-12-31,Q4_2024,Market Risk,Positive
"Yes, I'm just looking at you, Bank of America is one of the few that actually had small business loan growth year-on-year. And I know a lot of that came a couple of quarters ago. But with this very sharp increase in small business optimism, I would think that could potentially be something you could benefit from?","No question. And so but the real dollar volume of benefit is going to be -- the small business loans, I think grew -- have been growing quarter after quarter year-over-year for a good chunk at a time now. And we feel good about that. But the dollar volume change in the middle market business from a little more drawing on the lines consistent with what people have done before is a lot of loan balance, there's $200 billion of balances in that business.
