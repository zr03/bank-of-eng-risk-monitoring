We'll see how that plays out through the balance of the year. That has an impact on betas, but we shouldn't mistake price-sensitivity or interest rate sensitivity with the stickiness of the deposits.

"Yeah, look, again, look, the expense base is a key area of focus for us, right? We recognize that expenses have been growing. They've been growing because we've been investing in the franchise both transformation-wise as well as business-led growth to support the competitive advantages that we have in many of our franchises, but we're managing that very actively and very deliberately, and that means that we're looking to ensure that we're spending the money in the right way in the right places and that we're going to yield the benefits that we expect from that over time. And that was all factored into the targets that we set at our Investor Day for the medium-term, and what that requires is that we start bending the curve in 2024 as I stated and that we end in that medium-term at a place where we have an operating efficiency of about 60% and we're positioned to have returns that are in that 11% to 12% RoTCE point of view.",quarter,Mark Mason,CFO,16,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-14,Citigroup,transcript,"Mark Mason (CFO)

"There are a couple of factors that are going to contribute to lowering that expense base. One, the divestitures that we've been talking about, right. The second is the benefits from the transformation and other investments that I've just referenced. And the third is further organizational and management simplification efforts that we have underway that are enabled by the idea that we're exiting 14 consumer countries.

In view of what the disruptions we've seen in the banking system in the month of March with what went on with the regional banks here in the US and obviously the large investment bank over in Switzerland, do you guys see changes coming, or what changes do you see coming in terms of regulatory whether it's more capital, more liquidity, and it may not be directed at a company like yours because you're a global SIFI already and it might be more regionally orientated in the United States.

"Sure. Thank you for the question, Gerard. Well, I'd say that we hope that there will be a thoughtful and targeted approach to any changes in the regulatory and capital framework and that they address the root causes of what actually happened here, and what happened is a combination of macro impacts from the sharp, rapid rate increases and some idiosyncratic situations, namely a lack of proper asset and liability management at a small handful of banks.",quarter,Jane Fraser,CEO,16,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-14,Citigroup,transcript,"Jane Fraser (CEO)

"We don't see these issues as pervasive throughout the broader banking industry, but the events certainly highlight the importance of prudent asset and liability management.

In the face of tremendous market uncertainty, 11 of the largest US banks were able to come together to inject $30 billion of deposits into First Republic in a little over one day, and that speaks volumes for our capital and balance sheet positions, and I think the responsibility of large institutions in recognizing that we also play an important role here in helping stabilize situations like this.

I don't know if you would agree with this statement, but we're hearing that there was some FICO score inflation as a result of the pandemic. A lot of consumers saw their FICO scores go up, and I've seen numbers as high as 70 points, that may be on the high side, but can you guys, do you agree with that, and if you do, would you then expect the 700 FICO score customer at some point to behave like a 650 score customer?",quarter,Gerard Cassidy,Analyst,17,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-14,Citigroup,transcript,"Gerard Cassidy (Analyst)

"I think what's really important here, Gerard, is kind of what we're seeing in the way of the performance of the portfolio. So again, I've heard that sentiment regarding FICO score inflation. We feel very confident in how we've assessed our customers and what it means to have 80% of our customers prime and greater than 680. I think importantly, what we're seeing is we're seeing payment rates start to slow. We're seeing average interest-earning balances start to increase. We're seeing NCL rates increase, but particularly driven by the lower FICO score customers across the portfolio which is where you would expect to start to see that drag occur, and the NCL rates that we're seeing are still well below what we would see in a normal cycle and they're in line with what we've been forecasting for performance. So there are no surprises that we're seeing in terms of how that curve is evolving. We'd expect that it will get back to those normal levels towards the beginning of next year.

"Yeah, so, I guess a couple things. One, in terms of the rates that we've assumed, in the balance of the year, we've kind of assumed that rates would flatten out after this quarter, after this second quarter and then trend down a bit towards the end of the year. Down a bit to something like 4.50% or so, so we may have one rate increase and then flat and then down to about 4.50%. That could change, but candidly, if it changes a little bit here or there, it's unlikely to have a meaningful impact in 2023. That's likely to have more of an impact in 2024.

With that said, if you remember in the fourth quarter, we saw a nice run-up in deposits, and then we have the seasonality point that I referenced in my prepared remarks where we have both operational payments from our large TTS clients as well as tax payments with our TTS clients, also with Wealth clients to some extent kind of playing through the end-of-period deposits.

We've broken down the deposits for each of the businesses that we have, and at the bottom, you see the TTS deposits, and this is where the 5,000 or so large multinational client deposits reside, and you can see the stability, as well as the steady growth in those deposits over time. And to your point, these are largely operational deposits that these clients have with us, and we shouldn't mistake rate sensitivity or betas with stickiness, right, and it's because these deposits tend to be quite sticky with us, as you can see here.",quarter,Mark Mason,CFO,20,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-14,Citigroup,transcript,"Mark Mason (CFO)

"Now, they're price-sensitive in the sense that as rates go up, we often have to reprice those. But remember, the relationships we have with these clients are broader than just deposit relationships, and that's what gives us the opportunity to adjust pricing accordingly with our deposits both in the US and outside of the US. And so the other page, in your own time you can look at it is the page prior to that which again speaks to the diversification of the portfolio but it also speaks to the length of time that many of these clients have been with us and have grown with us, and so nearly 80% of our deposits are from clients that have a greater than 15 year relationship with us, and that says a lot.

Total revenues were down 2% on a reported basis. Excluding divestiture-related impacts, largely consisting of the $1 billion gain from the sale of the India consumer business in the prior year, revenues were up more than 3%, driven by growth across Banking, USPB and Services, partially offset by declines in Markets and Wealth. Expenses were $14.2 billion, up 7%, on a reported basis. Excluding divestiture-related impacts and the incremental FDIC special assessment, expenses were up 5%. Cost of credit was approximately $2.4 billion, primarily driven by higher Card net credit losses, which were partially offset by ACL releases in Wealth, Banking and Legacy Franchises. At the end of the quarter, we had nearly $22 billion in total reserves with a reserve-to-funded loans ratio of approximately 2.8%.",quarter,Mark Mason,CFO,4,Prepared remarks,Q1_2024,2024-04-12,Citigroup,transcript,"Mark Mason (CFO)

"On slide 7, we show the expense trend over the past five quarters. We reported expenses of $14.2 billion, which included the incremental FDIC special assessment of roughly $250 million. Also included in this number are $225 million of restructuring charges largely related to the organizational simplification. In total, we’ve incurred approximately $1 billion of restructuring costs over the last two quarters. As part of these actions, we expect approximately $1.5 billion of annualized run-rate saves over the medium term related to a headcount reduction of approximately 7,000. In addition to the restructuring, we took approximately $260 million of repositioning costs largely related to our efficiency efforts across the firm, including the reduction of stranded costs associated with the consumer divestitures. The expected savings from these actions will allow us to continue to fund additional investments in the Transformation this year. And relative to the prior year, the remainder of the expense growth was largely driven by inflation and volume-related expenses, partially offset by productivity savings. In the remainder of the year, we expect a more normalized level of repositioning, which is already embedded in our guidance. Therefore, you can expect our quarterly expense trend to go down from here in line with our $53.5-$53.8 billion ex-FDIC expense guidance.",quarter,Mark Mason,CFO,4,Prepared remarks,Q1_2024,2024-04-12,Citigroup,transcript,"Mark Mason (CFO)

Excluding Markets, net interest income was relatively flat. Average loans were up $4 billion, primarily driven by Loans in Spread Products in Markets, as well as Card and Mortgage loans in US Personal Banking, partially offset by declines in Services.

And we remain well reserved with a reserve-to-funded loan ratio of 8.2% for our total card portfolio. In our Corporate portfolio, the majority of our exposure is investment grade, which is reflected in our low level of non-accrual loans at 0.5% of total corporate loans.

Cost of credit was a benefit of $170 million, driven by a reserve release of approximately $200 million primarily related to a change in estimate as we enhanced our data related to margin lending collateral. Net income was $150 million. End-of-period client balances increased 6%, driven by higher client investment assets. Average loans were flat, as we continued to optimize capital usage. Average deposits decreased 1%, largely reflecting lower deposits in the Private Bank and Wealth at Work and the continued shift of deposits to higher-yielding investments on Citi’s platform, which more than offset the transfer of relationships and the associated deposits from USPB. Client investment assets were up 12%, driven by net new investment asset flows and the benefit of higher market valuations.",quarter,Mark Mason,CFO,6,Prepared remarks,Q1_2024,2024-04-12,Citigroup,transcript,"Mark Mason (CFO)

"Expenses were roughly flat due to lower compensation costs, including repositioning, offset by higher volume-related expenses. Cost of credit of approximately $2.2 billion increased 34%, largely driven by higher NCLs of $1.9 billion as card loan vintages that were originated over the last few years were delayed in their maturation due to the unprecedented levels of government stimulus during the pandemic and are now maturing. In Branded Cards, the NCL rate came in at 3.65%, in line with our expectations. In Retail Services, the NCL rate of 6.32% was slightly above the high end of our guidance range for the full year and will likely remain above the range in the second quarter, reflecting historical seasonality patterns. However, given the persistent inflation, higher interest rates and continued sales pressure at our partners, we now expect to be closer to the high end of the full year NCL guidance range for Retail Services. This expectation, along with the continued mix shift from transactors to revolvers across both portfolios, led to an ACL build of approximately $340 million.",quarter,Mark Mason,CFO,6,Prepared remarks,Q1_2024,2024-04-12,Citigroup,transcript,"Mark Mason (CFO)

So Services up 14% with growth in both TTS, between cross-border, clearing, commercial cards, but also – and Securities Services, right, with the growth that we're seeing from continued momentum in assets under custody.

"Okay. Good morning. Jane and Mark, I very much appreciate the comments on your growth opportunities and driving growth. But revenues are often dictated by the macro that is a little bit out of your control. So, can you talk a little bit about the flexibility on the expenses? You have a range in 2026 of $51 billion to $53 billion. So, if revenues are coming in below the targets, is it, I guess, A, fair to assume you'd be at the very low-end of that range or is – and I think there is some revenue growth built in there. So, is there some flexibility to the downside to try to get to your targets in a tougher revenue environment?

"Sure.

Despite that I'm telling you the same – I'm making the same point, which is you can expect a downward trend from here through to the end of the year and while there won't be additional restructuring charge, there will be the normal BAU activity around repositioning that plays through, so hopefully that answers your question, Betsy.

And they are the ones that clients need if they're going to be repositioning for a new order in trade or broader impacts here. And think about what you've seen over the last few years where we played a very central role: the Ukraine- Russia war, China, the COVID-related supply chains. We saw a lot of growth from deepening with clients and acquiring new ones because they need us, because we have exactly the expertise and the products and services that multinational institutions need, and we have them in the places that they need it. Now, the mix of those different revenues, different products and services we have could be different depending on which scenario prevails.

"So, if I dig down a bit more, what would the persistence of high tariffs, what would it mean? Well, it would dampen economic activity here in the in the U.S. and abroad. Cross-border trade flows will change, we'll be in the middle of facilitating that. So, we expect to be very busy there along with the hedging and associated financing activity that goes with it because it's not just about TTS. This is about the bundle of different capabilities we bring to bear. And take some comfort, look at what happened with the Ukraine war. We grew a lot in that time period. Equally, most of our business is very local. Think of what Services is, it's payroll, it's supplier management, it's liquidity, it's payables, it's receivables. And we're very deeply embedded into our clients' day-to-day operations in every market they work in as well as across market flows. And that's not going to change. It's not nearly as sensitive to tariffs. And I would say, I think all of us recognize the environment is very fluid right now. So let me also just say for clarity sake, at the firmwide level, our RoTCE targets for 2026 are still 10% to 11%. The drivers behind them are the same, but the revenue mix might be different.

We skew towards the higher investment grade, larger multinationals who also come into this with strong balance sheets. We've been very disciplined about that risk framework, our risk appetite, both on the corporate side as well as it relates to our consumers.

And so again, depending on how this evolves, we're well positioned to manage whatever the needs are of our clients, whether that be lending needs or the storing of liquidity, and we're very well reserved to manage whatever credit risk may come with that despite us being skewed towards higher quality names in both of those demographics.",quarter,Mark Mason,CFO,7,Q and A,Q1_2025,2025-04-15,Citigroup,transcript,"Mark Mason (CFO)

"Yes. So, I'd say a couple of things. So one, last quarter, we announced a $20 billion share repurchase program. And we continue to feel good about that program, as you would expect. And we increased our buybacks this year, or this quarter, I should say, to the $1.75 billion, seeing the strength of the performance that was playing out through the quarter. And so those are both, I think, indications of our continued commitment to returning capital to the shareholders. We're clear on where we're trading, and we're clear that, that is a smart thing to do once we've funded demand from a client point of view across our businesses, that's accretive to returns. And so, the RWA consumption is tied to that demand that we see. We think we've seen good client demand across the platform that's helped drive the top line momentum that you see in each and every one of our businesses that's helped to drive the improved returns that you see in the quarter in each and every one of our businesses. And as we see that demand, again, accretive in returns, we'll be looking to meet that as a first priority. We are targeting the 13.1% [CET1 Capital ratio] by the end of the year. But as you know, we'll get a new stressed capital buffer in June on the heels of the DFAST/CCAR work that's just been submitted, and we'll have to see what that tells us. That's hard to forecast as you well know. And so based on what that tells us will inform that downward trajectory, but that is what we're focused on. The combination of funding growth that's accretive to returns and returning capital to shareholders in a way that's consistent with that repurchase program.",quarter,Mark Mason,CFO,8,Q and A,Q1_2025,2025-04-15,Citigroup,transcript,"Mark Mason (CFO)

"Yes. Let me take that in a couple of different pieces. So, the first thing I'd say is that as I look at our credit exposure and I look at the consumer, the consumer continues to be resilient and discerning in their spend. And in fact, we did see spend hold up in the quarter, and we saw spend actually increase in our Branded Cards portfolio, up about 3%. The consumer has - we've seen a shift towards essentials and away from travel and entertainment.

And so, as we stress test it internally, the stressed losses with the businesses have, in fact, come down. Now obviously, we have to adhere to the regulator stress test, and so that shifted from the businesses into Corporate/Other, but it is a positive sign as we think about how the stressed capital buffer might evolve and as we exit different parts of the franchise, the underlying segments are already showing that that improvement would suggest lower levels of stressed losses.

"Hi, good afternoon. Just a follow-up question here on the buyback pacing. Your message has been pretty clear about the first half versus the second half. That said, with the stock at $65 versus tangible book at $90, I guess, are you just so scared from the volatility of the SCB result that, that just must be hurdle before you can accelerate the buyback? And Mark, perhaps if you could sort of dispel some of the notion that sometimes happens in some of these chats with buy-siders about your inability to dividend from the bank sub to the holding company in order to increase your buybacks over the near term. If you could address that, too, that would be great.",quarter,Erika Najarian,Analyst,12,Q and A,Q1_2025,2025-04-15,Citigroup,transcript,"Erika Najarian (Analyst)

"I think I'd say, I guess the easiest way to answer the question is to point to the IRE analysis that we show on a quarterly basis. And there are a lot of - that's obviously a risk measure. There are a lot of limitations associated with taking it too deeply or taking it too literally, but as you know, it is a view on how lower rates could impact Citi over a 12-month period. It assumes a static balance sheet, no growth, no change in composition or mix or changes in our hedging actions. And it is an instantaneous shock to the entire curve. With that said, we do break out the impact for U.S. dollar versus non-U.S. dollar. Remember, as you just referenced, there are over 60 currencies, but that asset sensitivity would suggest with a - in the fourth quarter - with a 100-basis point move across the currencies that the non-U.S. dollar impact would be $1 billion over a 12-month period. And so that take that with a grain of salt, but that gives you some sense as to the sensitivity to rates, that would assume all of those currencies and rates in those countries moved at the same time across the curve, and we did nothing to actively manage or dynamically manage the balance sheet.",quarter,Mark Mason,CFO,13,Q and A,Q1_2025,2025-04-15,Citigroup,transcript,"Mark Mason (CFO)

And then, rates and currencies, good increased client activity in portfolio trading. And then, we saw a lot of good spread product momentum driven by higher client activity and loan growth.

"So, I'm very curious on the whole revenue to RWA topic, especially with some of the changes coming in. So maybe you could give a little more color on -- let's take, for instance, the further reduction in subscription credit facilities. I think I read somewhere that was like an $80 billion book down to $20 billion. You can correct that if that's wrong. But just usually, those things are big important clients that have relationship lending, things attached to them. So, I'm curious on how you balance the capital benefit, the clear capital benefit, versus client impact and how you think about that?

"Thanks Glenn and good morning, and thanks for the question. Look, a couple of points on that. One is we've been very focused on the revenue to RWA metric in our Markets business in the ICG more broadly as well. And we've made considerable progress on that. And that's important because how we use the balance sheet and ensuring that we're optimizing the use of the balance sheet contributes to how we improve returns over time.",quarter,Mark Mason,CFO,8,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-14,Citigroup,transcript,"Mark Mason (CFO)

"You're right to point out the subscription facility, credit facility, lending that we do. We brought that down pretty significantly. The numbers you highlight are a lot higher than the portfolio. But what's important here is that as we look at that, we look at a couple of things. So, one, the nature of relationship and whether clients are taking advantage of the breadth of what we have to offer. Two, the profitability and returns associated with the product to the extent that it is in a broader relationship, and where those returns are low, subpar, and the prospect for doing more has proven to be fruitless, we take it down. And that's what we've done with a large part of that book, just as we juxtapose it against other opportunities to use balance sheet where clients are taking advantage of the broader franchise and therefore, are generating higher returns.",quarter,Mark Mason,CFO,8,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-14,Citigroup,transcript,"Mark Mason (CFO)

"And we're going to continue to do that. We've done that to drive the revenue to RWA metric. We've done it selectively on pieces of the portfolio like SCF. We've also looked at our broader corporate lending portfolio and where those promises for higher relationship returns aren't manifesting themselves, we've not renewed those loans. And as we think about pending regulatory changes, proactively making these efforts becomes critically important. When I look back on the activity that we've done over the past couple of years, we've reduced RWA by approximately $120 billion over the last 2 years, and about 75% of that is predominantly driven by balance sheet optimization and looking at client activity that has low margin business.

"Thanks, Glenn. We did take guidance up to slightly above $46 billion from the $45 billion. I guess there are a couple of things, and that’s ex-Markets, of course. There are a couple of things to think about in terms of headwinds and tailwinds that play through there. One is you've heard me mention before that we've reached terminal betas in the U.S. Two, deposit volumes and the shift mix as we see consumers kind of move into higher-returning type, higher-yielding type products. And three, really the wind-downs and the exits and the reduction that they will play out in terms of NII. So those are kind of 3 headwinds as we think about the forecast and the balance of year. There are obviously some potential tailwinds that play to the other side, including rate movements in non-U.S. dollar as well as Card volume growth. And as we look at those headwinds and tailwinds, our current read is to take it up, but $46 billion or slightly above that feels like the right level in the context of total revenues at $78 billion to $79 billion.",quarter,Mark Mason,CFO,9,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-14,Citigroup,transcript,"Mark Mason (CFO)

"Thank you. Let me take that. I'd say a couple of things. So, one, I'd reiterate the expense guidance that we've given for the full year. So that's the roughly $54 billion ex-divestitures, or the impact of divestitures, ex-any impact from FDIC special assessment. Two, as we think about bending the curve, I look into 2024 and we're looking to bring the absolute expense dollars down from Q3 to Q4. So that bending of the curve will occur.

Our current reserves are based on the mix of those 3 macroeconomic scenarios. It reflects about a 5.1% unemployment rate on a weighted basis over the 8 quarters, and it's roughly flat to what it was last quarter. What that means is, obviously, our downside scenario has unemployment that's much higher than that, closer to 7% or call it 6.8% or so.

So that would be what we’d be held to as of October 1. As Jane mentioned, the NPR as it comes out, we'll take a look at that and see if there are implications on the CET1 stack, but more likely implications on the risk-weighted assets, right? And what's really important there aside from the very important points Jane made in terms of considering broader factors is the timing of the implementation of whatever that final rule includes and obviously, the more timing for implementation, the more of an ability it gets for the industry to think about how to absorb the implications there.",quarter,Mark Mason,CFO,19,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-14,Citigroup,transcript,"Mark Mason (CFO)

And I would expect us to continue to see those types of shifts subject to how rates continue to evolve. And again, on the corporate side, we've seen in the U.S. clients have reached kind of those terminal, that terminal level, terminal betas, I should say, outside of the U.S. rate hikes, I think, are still in the future, as Jane alluded to, and the terminal betas have not quite yet been reached.

"Hi. Thank you. So, Mark, I heard your comments on credit this year. I'm talking the US Personal Banking. I heard your comments for credit the rest of this year and I think in a position that you're very conservatively reserved. But right now, you put up a 3% margin and credit costs are almost half of what revenues are in this space. I guess, my question is this: As we roll forward, in a slowing economy with likely a little bit lower – some rate cuts, how does the P&L evolve? How does it improve from here? Because can we be expecting credit costs to come in, in a slowing economy?

And as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, you have kind of a compounding effect of multiple vintages now maturing at the same time that's playing through the P&L. That's not just true for us, that's true for others as well.

And I'm asking this question in this context because consensus has a buyback of nearly $1 billion in the fourth quarter and staying at this rate for the first half of next year and ramping higher.

"So, thank you, Betsy. I guess I'd say a couple things. So, I think we said it in the past. So, the target for the medium term, we think 2026 is somewhere around $51 billion to $53 billion of expenses. As we've said, we'll have about $1.5 billion in savings related to the restructuring that we've done and another $500 million to $1 billion related to net expense reductions from eliminating the stranded costs as well as additional productivity over that medium-term period. And so, we've made, I think, very good headway, as Jane has mentioned, in the org simplification and the restructuring charges associated with that. Those saves will have started to generate. Some of those saves in the early part of that, meaning this year, will likely be offset by continued investment that we're making in areas of the business like transformation, but also in business-led or driven growth.

And frankly, in the first half of the year, as we work through the transformation work and some of the things that Jane and I have mentioned earlier in the year that we've been focused on, like data and data related to regulatory reporting, we've had to spend more than we had planned for in the first half, right, and we've done that and we funded that.",quarter,MARK MASON,CFO,13,Q and A,Q2_2024,2024-07-12,Citigroup,transcript,"MARK MASON (CFO)

Things that we have done in parts of USPB and that we have continued to get after in parts of Banking, which you see in the down 10% this quarter are areas where we've been keenly focused on, where are there duplicative roles, where are there inefficient processes that we can actually drive greater efficiency out of. So, longwinded way of saying, we understand the expense guidance that we've given, we also understand and stress the importance of funding the transformation with what's required and we're doing both.",quarter,MARK MASON,CFO,13,Q and A,Q2_2024,2024-07-12,Citigroup,transcript,"MARK MASON (CFO)

My question is a little bit different of, with the denominator going up 25%, in other words, a lot of things are working towards your Transformation, but there's sort of a curve ball in there with upping the denominator by 25%. So, you seem to be a beneficiary of higher for longer for sure. And you also mentioned you're working on mitigation as we speak.

"So, good morning, Glenn, it's good to hear from you. Let me make a couple comments on that, and then, Jane, feel free to chime in if you'd like. The first thing is that when I talked about this at the last conference we attended, I mentioned that analysts were somewhere in the 16% to 19% range in terms of a capital increase, and we're likely to be inside of that range, assuming the Basel III proposal as it’ s structured, as it's written, and obviously that's not the final, there's a period of review that's going on now.",quarter,Mark Mason,CFO,9,Q and A,Q3_2023,2023-10-13,Citigroup,transcript,"Mark Mason (CFO)

"What I'd say is a couple things, Glenn. One, we haven't fully executed against the strategy that Jane has just described. And obviously, continuing to simplify the business, managing through the Transformation, changing that business mix that we have to something that's more consistent and predictable and repeatable as it relates to PPNR, those things matter and impact the SCB. We talked about the exiting of the international consumer businesses. That will be a factor in what our balance sheet looks like and what stress losses might look like as well as lowering the expense base, which we know is an important factor in that PPNR math as well. And so, those things help, I think, to reduce the amount of capital that might be required as we get into that medium-term period.",quarter,Mark Mason,CFO,9,Q and A,Q3_2023,2023-10-13,Citigroup,transcript,"Mark Mason (CFO)

"Importantly, as you point out, there are other elements of the proposal that are going to require that we take a hard look at as well and identify mitigating actions to the extent that they make it into the final. So, think about the increase in operational risk and the fact that some of that is already included in SCB as something of a point of advocacy. But that's obviously a big headwind that we'll have to kind of work through, the FRTB and the enhancement of models.

We’re the bank that is absolutely there for them. And I think you've seen that in TTS, where we've had such strong drivers of growth in the last few years at the beginning of this trend. So, that is an important one. Wherever the clients want to go, we are there. We have been there for decades. We understand the risk. We understand the client base.

And we're starting to see that particularly in the debt capital markets, investment grade markets, where the expectation of no longer how high, but how long for rates, we've seen clients who get off the sidelines and just bite the bullet and get into the debt capital markets in a more meaningful way and no longer waiting on that.",quarter,Jane Fraser,CEO,12,Q and A,Q3_2023,2023-10-13,Citigroup,transcript,"Jane Fraser (CEO)

"But when I look out at the market, I talk to our corporate clients, that's where we tend to see them being more nervous about the softness in the consumer. And just, I call it they're much more mindful about where they're spending, right? So, you're seeing them moving down within a category. They're certainly looking more on the bargain front. We've been hearing that from our retail partners. We've been hearing that across the board. So, growth of card loans is good. Our spend is up, but less than loans.

And we obviously have invested in this business. So, the other thing that's driving this is the new account acquisitions are obviously important drivers of that spend volume and ultimately that loan growth.

"Hi Jane. Hi Mark. Want to just clarify the reorganization a little bit. So, Jane, I heard you say that you're keeping North Asia and South Asia heads. So, did you just get rid of the Asia head and get rid of the product heads, where product heads in each country were reporting to a regional product head? So, is that that dotted line is no longer there or what's going on there? And when you get rid of all the monthly management reporting, what are you planning to replace that with from your management, your MIS perspective?",quarter,Vivek Juneja,Analyst,15,Q and A,Q3_2023,2023-10-13,Citigroup,transcript,"Vivek Juneja (Analyst)

"So, let me take the second one first. I'm not planning on replacing it with anything. We don't need them. We're no longer running consumer franchises in the countries. Instead, we've got global businesses that are operating very consistently in the individual geographies, so we just don't need to replace them. And it enables us just to have the legal entity, financial management that we need. And then our internal reports get greatly simplified. Same as they get greatly simplified by taking out ICG and PBWM is another, eliminating that layer also eliminates a lot of different reports. So, the wonderful answer is, nothing, a simpler Citi.",quarter,Jane Fraser,CEO,15,Q and A,Q3_2023,2023-10-13,Citigroup,transcript,"Jane Fraser (CEO)

"The first question was about, okay, help you understand what we've done. So, on the geography front, we have done two main things already. One is we've eliminated the regions and have just put a single international head reporting to me. So, that makes it much simpler for me. I have one international head, and then he will help us manage the geographies collectively.",quarter,Jane Fraser,CEO,15,Q and A,Q3_2023,2023-10-13,Citigroup,transcript,"Jane Fraser (CEO)

"The second piece is we really narrowed the mandate of geography to delivering to our clients and covering our clients in their countries. And secondly, the legal entity management. And otherwise, before, we had a huge amount of management on shadow P&Ls and different, a lot of very heavy committee structure. That was necessary because the business was still very local, as a retail bank, a local credit card business, a local onshore wealth business. They've gone. It's just serving multinationals. The subsidiaries are multinationals and in some markets the investors and the wealth clients in some markets. And that's a much simpler business to manage. So, we could get rid of the regional layer, and we just jump straight down to the clusters that we have today.

"And the bit that I'm excited about is not just, yes, this makes it much simpler to manage, but it also helps us really focus on the global network. Now, our geographies and our banking organizations sitting together on the same management structure are collectively accountable for serving and delivering against our core client base. And they're in one team to do it. It just makes it much easier. Does that give you a feel?

"The other thing, Vivek, that I think is important here is we really want to spend a little bit more investment in time on the client lens in terms of the financial reporting, right? Because, as Jane talked about, we talked about the synergies across the franchise that we can capture, the ability to leverage the offering we have for those different client segments. So, looking at that P&L, looking at those returns, looking at that growth opportunity through that client lens will be something where we want to enhance the metrics that we have already around that so that we can capture that upside.",quarter,Mark Mason,CFO,16,Q and A,Q3_2023,2023-10-13,Citigroup,transcript,"Mark Mason (CFO)

"And around the other piece that I think is also just an important point, globalization is changing and we're seeing these lanes all changing through trade, financial flows, et cetera. By actually having a single international organization and then the different clusters, North and South Asia, Europe, UK, LATAM, Middle East, Africa, the connection points between them are really changing at the moment.

"Hi there. So, I wanted to continue on the thread of normalization of credit losses. And you guys have, I guess your guidance is implying that Branded Cards and Retail Services get back to more normalized levels by year-end, which is a decent-sized uptick over the levels you had in the third quarter. So, I kind of want to know what's driving that view. But more importantly I guess, what does that imply going forward? And does it imply that we get to more, something more like above trend losses?

I think what I'd point you to is page 24 in the deck that we have because it gives you a nice snapshot of how both the loss rates have been trending but also how the delinquencies have been trending.

"Hi. I looked in detail at the earnings presentation, especially slide 4, and I think the question is, on many people's minds, I count 12 restructurings at Citigroup. And I count 12 restructurings that have failed at Citigroup. You might disagree with the number 12, It could be 5, it could be 8, it could be 12, it could be more, but I've not spoken to one person of any investor who would say that Citi has succeeded on its prior restructuring. So, the question is, why is this time different? Number one, who is this new and improved Citigroup. Number two, why aren't expenses down even move, especially when few people that I talk to think you'll hit your revenue target?

I recognize 2024 is a critical year, and as I said, the decks are much clearer now, so that we can focus on two imperatives: improving our business performance and executing the transformation.

"Yeah, thanks, Jane. And why aren't expenses down more? I think to your point, Jane, we've been investing in the franchise both on the front-end, and importantly, on the transformation and the risk and controls. What I would point out is that, in 2023, we delivered expenses of $54.3 billion ex the FDIC charge. That is the guidance that we gave. But I also highlight that we also included $780 million associated with the restructuring charge. That is more than I had articulated in the way of guidance. So, the capacity that we created through our efforts through the year, we use that in a smart way. We use that to fund the org simplification cost, so that we can realize the savings down the line. And we're going to continue to manage our expenses in a disciplined and smart fashion. That means spending what we need to spend on the transformation and risk and controls, but driving greater efficiencies and productivities along the way to ensure we get to that 11% to 12%.

Your expense guidance is good, your revenue guide is good, and you have your arms around the expenses. The question I have is, how do you think about balancing that near-term profitability improvement that we all want desperately with making sure you do make the right investments?

"Yeah, thanks, Glenn. I guess, I'll start, and Jane, feel free to add in on it. Look, it is a balancing act, right, and we do look at each of our five core businesses. We obviously are clear on the strategy, but where's the growth? Where are the return opportunities associated with them? And how do we ensure we're deploying resources after them in order to deliver for the client and deliver on those returns over time? We have to juxtapose that against the required investment to modernize our operations and we're making those trade-offs on a regular basis. But importantly, when we do invest to capture those growth opportunities, we're trying to be agile about it, which means if those opportunities don't play out in the way we're expecting because the cycle just doesn't mature or materialize in that fashion, we've got to be disciplined enough to dial them back, and that's what you've seen over the past year plus, is that we've been investing in the business.",both,Mark Mason,CFO,10,Q and A,Q4_2023,2024-01-12,Citigroup,transcript,"Mark Mason (CFO)

Investment Banking, for example, we have invested in healthcare, in technology, building out to prepare ourselves for when that market rebounds. We feel good about that. We've done similar things in the way of our Wealth business. We're investing heavily in our TTS franchise to ensure we can remain competitive there, so it's that type of discipline that's required.

"Yeah and I'll jump in, too. Let's maybe start with TTS. When we think about the performance of TTS, which, as we say, the growth this year up 19% ex-Argentina, came from a combination of both rates and the strong business actions we've taken. And you can see that in the different drivers. Cross-border was up 23%, commercial cards up 8%. In terms of the growth prospects, we've generated 22% in average revenue growth, from 21 to 23, well ahead of the Investor Day guidance we had of high-single digits. That was not just because of the rate cycle. It obviously helped. And we certainly expect to grow revenues at mid-single digit now as we lap the prior periods that benefited from those rate increases, and that's going to come from a few different areas.",both,Jane Fraser,CEO,11,Q and A,Q4_2023,2024-01-12,Citigroup,transcript,"Jane Fraser (CEO)

So I think, the main takeaway from TTS is that we'll continue to invest in it. We expect to see strong client momentum.

You've got a range there and the reason I described it like that is that, if you think about our IRE, as we've shown it in the Qs before, we're positioned such that, with 100 basis point move, parallel shift in rate across the curve, the US dollar impact would only be a couple hundred million dollars, all right, and so, to the negative, obviously, but it's a couple hundred million dollars.

Similarly, if rates moved in the other way, positive of 100 basis points, there'd be a small movement as it relates to US dollar exposure.

That constitutes about 5,000 heads. We're just about to, at the end of this month, finish Phase 3, which will mean the first four layers of the organization have been addressed.

"Hey, good morning everyone. Just I think as Jane noted, it seems like a material driver of the reduction in the RoTCE target in 2026 is expenses. I think you kind of backed off the lower end of that, given higher investments in the Transformation but also talked about it being somewhat temporary. We appreciate the below $53 billion for 2026, but how much more is there to go beyond that in terms of eliminating parallel systems, running parallel systems, reduced consultant spend and all that stuff.

In the case of Retail Services, it's 5.75% to 6.25%, excuse me, and so right now, Retail Services is at that high end at 6.28% for 2024. We'd expect it to stay at that high end, and then on Branded Cards, we're at 3.64%, we'd expect it to creep up to about the 4% level over the course of the year.

"And then just in terms of the provision build, there are a couple of drivers there. One is obviously volume, and we do expect to see volume growth in USPB.

And then the second driver is obviously, as you know, we run models and the models they have a base scenario, they have a downside, an upside scenario depending on the broader macro factors, unemployment, GDP, et cetera, et cetera, and our weighting towards the likelihood of high or upside or downside scenario, those factors become important considerations in the provisioning.

"Thank you. Hate to ask the umpteenth question on the buyback, but clearly, the way the stock is reacting today, the buyback is very important to your shareholders. I guess my first question, if I could have the two questions, is it's very clear that you want to return capital to shareholders. It's very clear that you have excess capital. It's very clear that your PPNR trajectory is positive. And so what are the specific mile markers that that Citi needs to see in order to increase that pacing from that $1.5 billion a quarter to something is more suggestive of a pace that that would be in line with that $20 billion authorization? And I know that's been asked of you already, but is it the consent order? Is it the stress test? We had some news over the holidays that were positive for the sector. Like what are those specific mile markers? I mean you're doing it on the PPNR side, right?

But to that end, I mean just taking a step back, I think, Jane, you said something very important in that want to get to the returns in a sustainable way. And clearly, your shareholders are scarred by previous management when the returns went up to double digits and went back tumbling down and wasn't sustainable. And should we just really think of this as, look, like it takes a while to turn around a money center bank and 2026 may have been the target in 2022, but we're going to get there in 2027, 2028 anyway, and just doing this in a sustainable way, and we're not robbing the bank of investments.",year,ERIKA NAJARIAN,Analyst,11,Q and A,Q4_2024,2025-01-15,Citigroup,transcript,"ERIKA NAJARIAN (Analyst)

The gain or loss on sale will run through the P&L at deconsolidation, so that's the point where we've gotten, or we've IPO-ed more than the 50%. And the ultimate benefit will be driven by the RWA release when we fully divest our stake.

"So yes, the current quarter's results annualized to more than the $2 billion Jamie talked about. Yes, a big part of that reason is discount accretion which was very frontloaded as a result of short-dated assets. So, that's part of the reason that you see that converge. Yes, it's also true that we expect the expense run rate to decline later in the year as we continue making progress on integration. Obviously, as I think as I mentioned to you last quarter, from a full year perspective you just have the offset of the full year calendarization effect.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,17,Q and A,Q1_2024,2024-04-12,JPMorgan,transcript,"Jeremy Barnum (CFO)

"There's maybe an embedded question in there, too, about we had talked about $2.5 billion of integration expense. And the integration is real, the expenses are real, and also the time spent on that is quite real. It's a lot of work for a lot of people. It's going well, but we're not done yet; and it takes a lot of effort.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,17,Q and A,Q1_2024,2024-04-12,JPMorgan,transcript,"Jeremy Barnum (CFO)
JPMorgan, Q1, 2024 Earnings Call Transcript, Page 17",internal,False,Neutral
"But broadly, I think that our expectations for integration expense are probably coming in a bit lower than we originally assumed on the morning of the deal, for a couple of reasons. One is that the framework around the time was understandably quite conservative and sort of assumes that we would kind of lose a meaningful portion of the franchise, and would sort of need to size the expense base accordingly. And of course, it's worked out, to your point, quite a bit better than that. And therefore, the amount of expenses that is necessary to keep this bigger franchise is higher. And that means, less integration expense associated with taking down those numbers.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,17,Q and A,Q1_2024,2024-04-12,JPMorgan,transcript,"Jeremy Barnum (CFO)

"It's probably also true that the integration assumptions were conservative.

"As a quick follow-up. Where are the next homeruns going to come from? And this is more strategic beyond just JPMorgan, but there are probably going to be more regional bank failures, whether it's this year or next year, and opportunities to pick those up. But what you're seeing is that, private equity and family offices are setting up to participate in this next round of bank failures. Mnuchin's buying of NYCB is clearly to create a platform for rollups of failed banks, and then there are other family offices that have filed shelf registrations for bank holding companies whose specific purpose is to buy failed banks.",quarter,Charles W.

But if opportunities arise despite the uncertainty about the Basel III Endgame, we will be well positioned to deploy it.

And so, we've talked a lot, obviously, about how we are asset sensitive. You now see our EaR disclosed in the supplement, and probably our empirical EaR is a little bit higher than our modeled EaR as a result of the relatively low – lower than modeled rates paid in Consumer.

And then to show you how stupid CECL is, in the three month – three quarter period, we took down the $15 billion. So, just – that just sizes up a bad recession.

But when you take a step back and you ask, are we seeing signs of distress in the lower income segment? The answer is no. So, sure, the margin and cash buffers are lower, and you see some rotation of spend and spending is a little bit weaker than it was in the peak spending moments. But actually, some of the increases in spending that we're seeing in April are actually coming from the lower income segment.

"Hi. Good morning and thanks for taking my questions. Wanted to start off with one on the proposed SLR changes and just the impact of rate volatility. The Treasury is committed to providing relief to the banks under the SLR just to help mitigate some of the volatility in the 10-year. But given the geopolitical concerns, weakening global demand for treasuries, how does it inform your appetite just for purchasing U.S. Treasuries if those reforms are implemented and just how you're managing rate risk maybe more holistically across the Firm, just in light of some the recent volatility?",quarter,Steven Chubak,Analyst,10,Q and A,Q1_2025,2025-04-11,JPMorgan,transcript,"Steven Chubak (Analyst)

"And remember, it's not relief to the banks; it's relief to the markets. JPMorgan will be fine with/without an SLR change. The reason to change some of these things is so banks – the big market makers could intermediate more in the markets. If they don't – if they do, spreads will come in, there'll be more active traders. If they don't, the Fed will have to intermediate, which I think is just a bad policy idea that every time there's a kerfuffle in the markets, the Fed has to come in and intermediate.

"The point – the reason why is when you have very – a lot of volatile markets and very wide spreads and low liquidity in treasuries, it affects all other capital markets. That's the reason to do it; not as a favor to the banks themselves. And we don't take more interest rate exposure to this in any way, shape or form. So it's not like we're going to change our position. We intermediate in the markets to help clients do what they have to do. And if the banks could take bigger positions, they would have just larger dealer positions and take no – basically take not much more interest rate exposure.

Is it mild or hard? I don't know and – but we are – I've been quite cautious, and you can see in our capital, our liquidity, our position, our balance sheet. And so we're prepared.

I'm going into this because I noticed your average loan growth, I think it was running at about 2% year-on-year. And then end of period loans was up 5% and wholesale loans was up 7%. So I'm just wondering if there was some line drawdowns at quarter end. And it's a broader question on just liquidity. Do you see your customers looking for more liquidity? Are they drawing down lines? And maybe if you could speak to liquidity in the front end of the market, that would be helpful, too. Thank you.",quarter,Betsy L.

"Yeah, it's a good question, Betsy. So a couple of things. One is in our soundings of our wholesale clients during sort of the moments of peak uncertainty, we did hear them talking about wanting to focus on shoring up liquidity. Interestingly, I actually asked the question like a day ago, whether we were seeing draws, meaningfully observable draws from clients. And the answer to that question was no, at least not yet. So, I don't know what to make of that, but perhaps it suggests that we do not see that level of heightened anxiety that people are more just focusing on addressing their supply chain issues right now.

"Jeremy – I agree. Jeremy, I would add to that. Volatility leads to bigger bid-ask spreads, that, all things being equal, is better. And it leads sometimes to higher volumes. So you've seen really high volumes in FX and interest rate swaps, a whole bunch of different things, treasuries. That's better. But as Jeremy pointed out, sometimes that kind of volatility leads to very low volumes, like you see in DCM today when you don't have these bond deals where you have less trading, when you have – so it will have lower volumes in certain markets and stuff like that. And how it all filters through is almost impossible to tell. But our folks do a great job and we're here to help our clients.

I think you do have, in the $95 billion guidance, you do have a good amount of growth penciled in for investing in bankers and branches and tech and marketing.

And there are also some ups and downs in there, I should note, including the fact that there is some sensitivity to the expense base to the strength of the dollar, or weakness in this case.

"Morning. Jeremy, on page 4 of your presentation, you show some liquidity metrics. And there's been a meaningful deterioration, or I shouldn't say deterioration, depletion of some of that excess liquidity, obviously for First Republic primarily. So my question is how quickly do you want to rebuild that liquidity because as I look out towards 2024, there's probably a half dozen variables that are going to make liquidity a premium event – to have excess liquidity?

"All right. So sort of wrapped into that as a follow-up, if you take your $87 billion forecast for NII this year, and that implies at least one quarter of maybe $22 billion of NII, and you take your eventual forecast of mid-$70 billion of NII at some point in the future, that would imply at least one quarter of $18 billion of NII so that's about an 18% drop. And if you hold the balance sheet steady, you're talking about a 30-basis point drop in your margin, your NIM, to get from $22 billion to $18 billion.

"Sure. Good question, Matt. I mean, I guess, the way I think about it is a couple of things, like our returns tend to be a bit seasonal, right? So, if you kind of build yourself out a full-year forecast and make reasonable, just based on your own or analyst consensus or whatever and you think about fourth quarter, like better look at this on a full-year basis when you think about the returns than the quarterly numbers and you obviously have to strip out kind of the one-time items.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,9,Q and A,Q2_2024,2024-07-12,JPMorgan,transcript,"Jeremy Barnum (CFO)

"And so, if you do that, like whatever you get for this year, is still clearly a number that's higher than the 17%.

And then maybe more importantly, if you believe what obviously what you wrote, what are you doing about it? How do you manage yourself conservatively? How do you prepare for tougher times?",quarter,Glenn Schorr,Analyst,13,Q and A,Q3_2023,2023-10-13,JPMorgan,transcript,"Glenn Schorr (Analyst)

So, I guess one thing to say, right, is that we did have a sequential increase in NII this quarter and, as you may recall, at Investor Day, I said that there was some chance that we would see sequential increases followed by sequential declines and that people should avoid kind of drawing the conclusion that we'd hit the trough when that happens.

So therefore, in order to answer your question, I would say, yes, we want a steeper curve, but having the Fed cut more than what's currently in the yield curve is definitely at the margin, for the context of next year's numbers a headwind – would be a headwind for us, we remain asset sensitive to Fed cuts.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,7,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-11,JPMorgan,transcript,"Jeremy Barnum (CFO)

"And I do think, Gerard, it depends a lot on what type of loans you're talking about, right? So I think in the end, as Jamie says, like it's capital. We're going to deploy it ideally to grow the franchise organically, and that could include loans that are almost good loans on a stand-alone basis, as well as loans that are part of an overall relationship, what we're getting other revenue as part of that. So it's the same strategy that we've always had, but I wouldn't think of it as like excess capital to be deployed against a particular product. I would think of it as it's there for a rainy day.

"I would say, Matt, generally no, frankly, with a couple of minor exceptions. So I think it's probably fair to say that the outperformance late in the quarter in investment banking fees was to a meaningful degree, as I mentioned, driven by DCM as well as to some degree driven by the acceleration of the closing of some M&A transactions. And I do think that some of that DCM outperformance is in the sort of types of deals that are opportunistic deals that aren't in our pipeline, and those are often driven by treasurers and CFOs sort of seeing improvement in market levels and jumping on those.

"So I think what there is to say about consumer spend is a little bit boring in a sense because what's happened is that it's become normal, so meaning – I mean, I think we're getting to the point where it no longer makes sense to talk about the pandemic, but maybe one last time. One of the things that you had was that heavy rotation into T&E as people did a lot of traveling and they booked cruises that they hadn't done before, and everyone was going out to dinner a lot, whatever. So you had the big spike in T&E, the big rotation into discretionary spending, and that's now normalized. And you would normally think that rotation out of discretionary into nondiscretionary would be a sign of consumers battening down the hatches and getting ready for a much worse environment. But given the levels that it started from, what we see it as is actually like normalization.

"Of course, there are some ways in which being a bank hinders our ability to do that.

And a world where more and more of that activity gets pushed outside of bank market makers is a meaningful change to that structure that is untested, and it's unclear why you would want that. And we've cautioned that if that's the intent of the regulations, it should be intentional and well-studied.

And so they are both competition from our standpoint, but we're there. We're going to do it. We're can always deploy more capital if we want. And we would even deploy more capital at lower returns if we really had to do that to service clients. So we're very conscious of it. There will be competition both sides.

"So I just want to add a couple policy things here. I'm not actually sure they can actually do that, because you have inflationary factors out there, partially driven by QE. And also, look at the volatility. It's not a risk to JPMorgan. It's a risk to the system. And what banks have, I already mentioned the constrained balance sheet a little bit. So the banks will have trillions of dollars of cash and unable to deploy the repo markets. And is it a good policy thing that every time that happens, because you can do it very safely, fully collateralized, all things like that, providing what I call flexible financing in the marketplace, that that happens, the Fed has to step in every time? I think that becomes a policy issue that every time there's some kind of fluctuation in the market, people panic and the Fed has got to step in and provide stuff.

"You also obviously have a little bit of the fixed asset, fixed-rate asset reprice dynamics starting to flow through a little bit. While we're on NII, just to annoy Jamie a little bit more, I do want to make a point that I didn't get a chance to make previously, which is there's a reason that we emphasize the implied fourth quarter run rate for the Markets NII in the presentation which is that if you take that and you annualize it, it gives you a launch point run rate, which is significantly higher than what's currently in the consensus and obviously what we've seen this year. And I'll give you the concise version of my usual speech that changes in Markets NII are almost always bottom-line neutral and offset in NIR. But for the purposes of trying to help you guys with your models, I would just encourage you to recognize what that launch point is, the number of cuts that are in the curve, the fact that that number has historically and in the recent past has been quite liability-sensitive, so you can draw your own conclusions about what that should mean. Again, shouldn't change the overall revenue expectation. It's just a balance sheet and income statement geography issue.

"Hey. Good morning. I'm not going to ask about a specific NII in 2025, but I did want to delve into the how to think about your deposit margin in volume dynamics in the CCB over the next few years. You have seen a decent amount of pressure in the deposit margin, 2.6%, down about 30 basis points as deposit balances have come down, so it put some pressure on deposit NII. But deposit margins are still well above where they were when rates were at levels that are consistent with where the forward curve now has been going. So I guess how do we think about both volumes and margin dynamics if rates do come down, say, to the level that are consistent with the forward curve? I know the forward curve is likely going to be long, but that's the reference point we have.",quarter,Saul Martinez,Analyst,17,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-11,JPMorgan,transcript,"Saul Martinez (Analyst)

"Sure. Yeah, thanks for the question, Saul. And I think you've laid out the building blocks there already. Just for simplicity, I'm going to try to answer your question without referring to the disclosed CCB deposit margin number, just because that number is obviously the combination of the rate paid on the CCB deposits and the internal FTP into that. And that is a complicated thing that evolves as a function of the modeling of the betas and other things. So I think it's actually more helpful to look at this simply from a Firmwide perspective and look at the evolution of the rate paid in the context of the policy rates roughly, and just set aside the duration management and all those sort of factors.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,17,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-11,JPMorgan,transcript,"Jeremy Barnum (CFO)

"And I think when you do that, what you see is we've been saying for a while that the deposit margin defined for these purposes is simply the difference between the policy rate and the weighted-average rate paid of the consumer deposits, was unsustainably high. And that was going to have to correct one way or the other. Either deposits were going to reprice at the product level through checking and savings, and/or we were going to see a ton of internal migration, i.e. growth in the CD mix, and/or we would see a lower policy rate. So as we sit here right now, of course, we make pricing decisions in the context of market competition at any given moment looking at what the environment is for deposits, but we have not needed to reprice in order to retain primary bank relationships which was also our core strategy. We were never going to chase sort of the hot money at the margin.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,17,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-11,JPMorgan,transcript,"Jeremy Barnum (CFO)

"We've leaned in heavily to CDs and gotten to the current level of CD mix, and that's been a good strategy.

"Now, on the way down, it's not going to go back down to zero, where it was at the beginning of the cycle. That's an important thing to realize. So all else equal, that creates a little bit of margin compression. And then through all of that, obviously, a lower yield environment should mean that there's a little bit less outflow from consumer deposits, as I mentioned. We're seeing a lot less yield-seeking behavior. So then when you overlay on to that what you mentioned, which is our long-term share growth in CCB deposits, in no small part as a function of the brand strategy and the buildout and the fact that only about a quarter of our top 125 markets in CCB are at that 15% share number, so we believe there's big opportunity to grow the rest of it and be on track at the type of average annual share growth of the order of 30 basis points or 40 basis points that we've seen historically.

On deposits, we expect balances to be very modestly down from current levels. While lower rates should decrease repricing pressure, we remain asset sensitive, and therefore, lower rates will decrease NII, resulting in more normal deposit margins.

I think, empirically, the number is maybe a little higher than that just because even though we do model lags in the EaR, we've been seeing the lag effect be a little bit bigger.

"Hi. Good morning. My first question is a follow-up on Matt's with regarding the buyback. You printed 15% CET1 in the quarter. On a net basis, net of RWA growth, your net income produces 51 basis points every quarter. Again, that's net of RWA growth. I'm wondering what guideposts you're looking for, Jeremy, in terms of that buyback increasing from that $2 billion a quarter. Do we need to wait for Basel III finalization, which seems like it could be quite delayed? Or will having clarity in the June D-FAST results – you mentioned the SCB – sort of be enough that you could reconsider this pace over the medium term?",both,Erika Najarian,Analyst,7,Q and A,Q4_2023,2024-01-12,JPMorgan,transcript,"Erika Najarian (Analyst)

"Yeah. Erika, that's a good question. And I understand what you're asking – why you're asking it. I think the answer is going to be a little bit unsatisfying, which is that this is classic decision-making under uncertainty and it's kind of a probabilistic cloud of a variety of different factors. But, all the ingredients that you've listed are the right ingredients; right, very strong organic capital generation, uncertainty about the finalization of the rule, uncertainty about the SCB requirements, and obviously, our normal capital hierarchy, which is that buybacks are always at the bottom of the hierarchy after we're done using the capital for our other priorities.",both,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,7,Q and A,Q4_2023,2024-01-12,JPMorgan,transcript,"Jeremy Barnum (CFO)

We had an 8% growth in active card accounts. And over the last three years, we've increased deposit market share by 180 basis points.

"The CIB story is a little bit different. The percentage growth there is lower, which recognizes, I think, both our very, very strong share positions as a starting point and also the fact that we've been investing quite aggressively for some time in the Payments business, which has produced meaningful payoffs already there in terms of significant share gains. So, as a result, the biggest driver in the CIB is really generic inflation, including labor as well as, again to the prior question, volume and revenue-related increases tied to the improved NIR outlook. And I do want to say for the avoidance of doubt that despite all of this, our core strategy of looking very granularly at all the areas of strength and weakness and making sure that we're upgrading where appropriate to have absolutely the best talent in the CIB remains fully in effect.",year,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,8,Q and A,Q4_2023,2024-01-12,JPMorgan,transcript,"Jeremy Barnum (CFO)

And those drivers are consistent with what they've been, new products, features and customer platforms, as well as modernization. So, that's happening throughout the company both at the app level and otherwise.

I think that the math is the math in the sense that QT, all else equal, is withdrawing from system-wide deposits.

So – and we still have reasonable levels of reserves and some cushion from RRP. So, that's part of the reason that our outlook is for deposits to be modestly down, with the shrinkage in system-wide deposits maybe partially offset by our belief that we can take some share.

I think there've been some modest challenges with the 2023 IPO vintage in terms of post-launch performance or whatever.

"In DCM, again, all else equal, lower rates are clearly supportive. One of the nuances there is the distinction between the absolute level of rates and the rate of change, that sometimes you see corporates seeing and expecting lower rates, and therefore, waiting to refinance in the hope of even lower rates. So, that can go both ways. And then, M&A is a slightly different dynamic. I think there's a couple nuances there. One, as you obviously know, announced volume was lower this year. So, that will be a headwind in reported revenues in 2024, all else equal. And of course, we are in an environment of M&A regulatory headwinds, as has been heavily discussed.

So, one thing that we said when we kind of gave First Republic guidance at Investor Day earlier this year is that while we understood the need to track that, and we've been splitting out First Republic in our reported results in order to improve period-on-period comparability, we kind of want to stay out of the business of guiding on First Republic.",year,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,12,Q and A,Q4_2023,2024-01-12,JPMorgan,transcript,"Jeremy Barnum (CFO)

"Having said that, let me just react to a couple of the things that you said. So, again, I don't want to get into like micro-validation one way or the other of some of your back-of-the-envelope math. But we did have some accelerated pull to par on some of the accretion of some of the loans that we purchased this year. So, I think the annualization that you're doing is maybe a bit high for the 2024 number. And then, from a sensitivities perspective, I actually think I can simplify the math for you a little bit and just kind of direct you to the EaR per my response to the prior question. Because that EaR fully includes all of the First Republic assets and liabilities with all of the various dynamics. And so, I think that's kind of like an easier way to think about it for the company.",year,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,13,Q and A,Q4_2023,2024-01-12,JPMorgan,transcript,"Jeremy Barnum (CFO)

"Yeah. I mean, I can probably answer that question if I think about it for a second, but it sort of violates my prior statement that I really don't want to get into the business of guiding on First Republic. If I do the big picture, right, so big picture, 2023, we had eight months of First Republic NII. 2024, we're going to have 12. So, all else equal, there's calendarization in there. What's also true is that in 2023, as a result of the impact of the NII of the pull to par of certain relatively short-dated assets that we fair-valued at a meaningful discount as part of the transaction, that sort of – that pull to par happens quite quickly, and therefore, probably juiced the 2023 number a little bit. So, therefore, straight annualization is probably not the right way to think about it. Then, you just get into the questions about the FTP and the funding and whatever, and then this is like too complicated.

"So, yeah, you've noted all the points that we always make so I won't repeat them. And I think the way we're thinking about it right now is that we feel very comfortable with the notion that it makes sense for us to have a nice store of extra capital in light of the current environment. We believe there's a good chance that there will be a moment where we get to deploy it at better levels essentially in whatever way than the current opportunities would suggest. And so that feels like a correct kind of strategic and financial decision for us. Having said that, having studied it quite extensively over the last six months and have all the debates that you would expect, we've concluded that we do have enough. We have enough excess.

"So, when you think about the implications of that, given the amount of organic capital generation that we're producing, it means that unless we find in the near term opportunities for organic deployment or otherwise, it means more capital return through buybacks, all else being equal, in order to arrest the growth of the excess. And that is our current plan, although, I'll give the caveat that, as you know, is in our disclosure, which is we don't want to get in the business of guiding on buybacks, and we reserve the right to change the trajectory at any time for any reason, but that is our current thinking.",year,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,5,Q and A,Q4_2024,2025-01-15,JPMorgan,transcript,"Jeremy Barnum (CFO)

So, we are seeing the results of our kind of high certainty investment choices across all the categories that you know very well and that we highlighted on the outlook page for expenses, and those continue to be the main areas of focus. The execution gets tweaked at the margin as we pursue different opportunities in the Commercial & Investment Bank. We continue drilling down and analyzing into the relative pockets of weakness that you might see if you go a level or two below the very significantly strong share positions that you see on an aggregate level. Daniel always talked about the reds and the ambers that are behind the greens, and that's embedded in the culture of the company.

So, the fact that we've gotten to a peak and then it might come down a little bit from here still means we're going to be constantly modernizing.

"But any time you have that quantum of headcount growth as well as that rate of headcount growth, you have to believe, all else equal, that some amount of inefficiency has been introduced. And so, this year, as we went through the budget cycle, we ask people, at the margin, to try to support the growth of the company while living within their means on the headcount front. So we're going to try to run things, with some important exceptions that I'll highlight in a second, on roughly flat head count and have that lead to people generating internal efficiencies as they get creative with their teams, and we consider more efficient ways of doing things. The obvious exceptions are the ongoing areas of high certainty investment and growth, so, obviously, branches and bankers and so on. And also, critical non-negotiable areas of risk and control like cyber or whatever independent risk management needs to ensure that we're running the company safely.

I think what I'm hearing from investors now, it goes up and down, but I think investors would like you to stay. So, why say you're going to stay less than five years? You're finally getting what you wanted, 15 years, your spaghetti chart about the regulatory structure and the unpredictability of capital requirements and regulatory costs, and it seems like you're finally getting what you've been playing for.

But I could go down some pretty deep rabbit holes speculating on all the different parts of the framework and how they could evolve, and I just don't really think that's productive right now. But let me make some attempt to answer your question. So, backing up a second, if you read Jamie's quotes, they're very consistent with what we've been saying as a company for a long time, which is that all we want is a coherent, rational, holistically-assessed regulatory framework that allows banks to do their job, supporting the economy, that isn't reflexively anti-bank, that doesn't default to the answer to every question being more of",year,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,7,Q and A,Q4_2024,2025-01-15,JPMorgan,transcript,"Jeremy Barnum (CFO)

"Can I just add, no that's great. Jeremy gave it all. Let me add three quick things. Liquidity is also equally important. There's been a lot of recognition that what counts as liquidity and discount windows and how LCR is done I think is very important. Second is competition. All these things should be done in light of looking at what kind of public markets you want, what kind of private markets you want, what do you want in the banking system, what you want out of the banking system. And the third is I think most people realize there is a huge need to take a step back and look at the Byzantine, Balkanized system we built which has negatives, and even the regulators will tell you that.

I think it's probably explained by a combination of wide-open capital markets, and so many of the larger corporates accessing the capital markets and healthy balance sheets in small businesses and maybe some residual caution. And maybe there are some pockets and some industries where some aspects of the policy uncertainty that we might be facing are making them a little bit more cautious than they otherwise would be about what they're executing in the near-term.

So, obviously, from what we understand, if you print that – somewhere near that score at the end of this year, then your G-SIB surcharge goes up by – to 5% or by 50 basis points two years and one day from now.

So, yes, it was a high print in the third quarter, but we had normal seasonality third quarter and fourth quarter. So, while our current view of G-SIB number is an estimate, we're quite confident that we wound up comfortably in the 5% bucket just as a result of normal seasonality.

But, anyway, for now, we're managing to the current rules, and normal seasonality took us back under 5%. Okay, you mentioned the lawsuit. I think the only thing to say about that is that we are happy to see the clear recognition on the part of the Fed that many of the things that we've been talking about for a long time in terms of transparency and volatility, and some of the non-substantive bureaucratic burden associated with the CCAR process needs improvement.

"I think if you take a big step back, by historical standards, the difference between the policy rate and the weighted average rate paid on consumer deposits remains quite elevated for a variety of reasons and subject to the fact that in the end, deposit pricing is always going to be a response to the competitive environment that we experience in the field, the current structure of the yield curve is such that, for the time being anyway, when we do the math, that's what we see.

It's just that the strategy is very different and it's a very different moment. So it's a new initiative. It's obviously not risk-free, but it's going pretty well. And pointing out the obvious, if we didn't think it was worth it, we wouldn't be doing it. But we have obviously considered all of the risks and opportunities associated with the decision.

"Guys, can you hear me okay? All right. Just want to make sure you can hear me. So this has been a great call. First, congratulations on a great quarter. It's been a great call with a lot of robust questions here. You're like, what else is there to ask? Here's my question. As we think about the NII outlook and you highlighted the NIM pressure, but loan – but basically, balance is increasing here, right? Maybe you could just speak to – could you help me understand the order of the drivers? Is it QT going away, deposits going up, punch it into securities? Is it loan growth inflecting? Is there any place in the franchise where you see loan growth opportunities for inflection this coming year? And then lastly, as I think about your comments around you've got the green market share number one, you've got the yellow, you've got the red, places maybe we can't see. Could you help us understand where those yellows and reds are – where they are? Are they just scattered, everybody – every single business has one? Or are there some that have more than others and, therefore, more opportunities? And is it more balance sheet or fee-generative? That's kind of what I'd like to just discuss if you have a minute.

"Sure. Yeah, let me take a crack at that, Betsy. So, loan growth, I think looking for areas where it might inflect, the only thing I can think of, frankly, that would be in that category, certainly in terms of being meaningful to the company's performance, would be acquisition finance because that's been relatively muted as a a function of the M&A environment, and if that picks up you could see more there. Now, those aren't loans that we necessarily keep on the balance sheet for that long, so whether that shows up in fees or NII or whatever, it's a separate issue.",year,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,12,Q and A,Q4_2024,2025-01-15,JPMorgan,transcript,"Jeremy Barnum (CFO)

"But as you can see like on our presentation page for the NII outlook, you know that Card loan growth and revolve normalization has been a significant tailwind.

"Still growing above trend obviously, which is great, and it's a sign of the strength of the franchise and the amount of engagement that we're getting from our Card clients, but the big normalization tailwinds there are gone. You know well the state of the mortgage market given rates. Rates are also a headwind in some other pockets like our multifamily lending business at the margin. So, yeah, I think a higher growth environment, a little bit more optimism, could you see a bit more loan growth in Business Banking? Could you see a bit more growth in C&I at the margin? Yes. But I think the place where you might see inflection is more in the areas that are deal-driven, I would say. So, we'll see. We'll see what happens there.",year,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,12,Q and A,Q4_2024,2025-01-15,JPMorgan,transcript,"Jeremy Barnum (CFO)

"And in terms of the reds and the ambers under the green, I think you know them, right? And they're aligned with our big long-standing investment strategies. The biggest single one arguably is that in what you might call the affluent section of the Wealth Management space, we are significantly underpenetrated relative to the number of households that we bank in the country and our capabilities and our brand and what we think we bring to the table. So, that's why we're pushing so hard on that front, because I think we can get more share there and it completes the franchise very nicely. There are a bunch of examples elsewhere, but we talk a lot about drilling down inside the Markets business, inside Investment Banking and finding the places where even where at the aggregate global sector level we look great and any given region and any given subsector we can do better.

Like, if we anchor to the fact that you have a new administration that's taking place or take office with a focus on domestic CapEx. Even if we don't get any rates cut, when you look through your customer base where do you see areas of vulnerability, be it because of tariffs, be it because of just lack of any additional relief from the Fed?

"Oh, I see where your question is. That took me a second. Yeah, I mean, look, wholesale credit is pretty hard to predict. It tends to be very idiosyncratic. You obviously know that we're coming out of a 10-plus year period of an exceptionally low charge-off rate, and so at some point that has to normalize to a slightly more reasonable level, a little bit to Jamie's comments earlier about how some things are still not fully normalized, and arguably wholesale credit could be one of those. We do run extensive stress tests on the sensitivities to the portfolio – of the portfolio to rate shock. A lot of what we do from an underwriting perspective is designed to protect us from that, frankly. So, you can rest assured that we're running the relevant analysis, but I'm not inclined to go into detail on any given sector or whatever.

"I would just point the biggest driver of credit has been and always will be unemployment. That's both in the consumer side and it bleeds into the corporate side. It bleeds into mortgages, sub-prime, credit card. So, really, it's your forecast of unemployment, which you have to make your own, which will determine that over time. And so, the second thing you said, vulnerabilities, it's unemployment, but the worst case would be stagflation. Higher rates with higher unemployment will drive higher credit losses literally across the board.

"Yeah. I think the conventional wisdom on QT, and I'm not pretending to add to the conventional wisdom one way or the other, is that the tapering should sort of complete and, therefore, we might see an end sometime in the middle of the year. Of course, they may change that, but that seems to be the current market consensus. And when we sort of take a step back and look at the H.8 data and our kind of flow of funds models and that type of stuff, when you look at the way our peers are behaving, evolution of QT, expectations for economy-wide loan growth, et cetera, and what the impact of that might be on the growth of system-wide deposits, it's kind of consistent with the story that we're telling about sort of the background growth in our NII outlook, plus or minus, what happens with the policy rate and stabilizing and growing deposit balances through the second half of the year.",year,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,13,Q and A,Q4_2024,2025-01-15,JPMorgan,transcript,"Jeremy Barnum (CFO)

"That's fascinating, Gerard. I’ll have to take a look at that data. I don't actually recognize those numbers. But I can speak for ourselves, which is that when we look at the encouraging growth that we see in our checking franchise, it's a couple of things. So, of course, there was some excess, and there was some yield-seeking behavior. So you did see people moving money out of checking into higher-yielding alternatives over the course of the last couple of years in the rate cycle. It feels to us as if we're in the final innings of that. We're just not seeing nearly as much yield-seeking pressure as we had seen.

And if you get to where you have a more -- Fed funds rate of 3.5%, which is what our experts predict sort of stops out at -- the ability to bring that sensitivity tighter and tighter is there, because you actually have room to move down without hitting zero floors and stuff. So there's -- and so stability, the rate -- time periods in which the rate environment doesn't flip around. And then secondly, a higher nominal rate environment allow you to manage to that outcome, because part of the other outcome for us is just as the rate structure is nominally very low is the zero floors kick in.

We expect to start the year in the first quarter with NII modestly higher than the fourth.

Then we expect that growth to increase through the year to the point where it could be 6% to 7% higher in 2025 than 2024. We expect to exit the year at least $1 billion higher in the fourth quarter and that would put us in a range of $15.5 billion to $15.7 billion on a fully taxable equivalent basis, and that's obviously significantly higher than the Q2 '24 trough of $13.9 billion.",quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,5,Prepared remarks,Q4_2024,2025-01-16,Bank of America,transcript,"Alastair Borthwick (CFO)

We're obviously pointing right now to deposit growth in particular because it's beginning to get back to something more normal. There was a period there where deposit balances were declining as people got back to something more normal in their accounts. But we're highlighting here: Consumer found its floor in August, Wealth found its floor in July. And that's giving some support then as we grow deposits. That's helping us with the NII growth.

"So I think what gives us confidence, we have periods with stable rate environments, a stable economy, growing at a slower rate than it is now. And having produced that for 5 years in a row, I think it was by quarters or something like that. And so it's not something we haven't done. But if you think about the current environment, what's driving is different. Our revenue growth is growing at twice that rate plus and the expense growth is growing close to that number. But when you get to higher growth rates, especially where it's coming from Wealth Management business, market-based business, businesses in investment banking, it attaches a higher sort of instantaneous expense. And yet it still produces even a little bit of operating leverage at a higher growth rate, a good after-tax, a good EPS result, a good net operating income results. So there's different times, different models. This is a model where revenue is growing faster than it might grow all the time in more normalized environments, but the business is coming from are those businesses which have the quickest move relative to expense.",year,Brian Moynihan,CEO,9,Q and A,Q4_2024,2025-01-16,Bank of America,transcript,"Brian Moynihan (CEO)

And you see the revenue base of the company broaden out, you'll see that we'll get back to the operating leverage that we expected, albeit it may be a little slower year-over-year growth rate, unless you're going to tell the market, it's going to go up 25%, 30% every year and drive the wealth management.

"Yes. I think the capital normalization will be more sort of holding that capital to grow through it and not have to retain more capital for growth, frankly, if there's math that helps us favor it. But the NIM is probably more critical to move the yield from sub-2% this quarter -- 2% this quarter to 2.10%+ at the end of the fourth quarter and then moving from there. That, as you know, is -- all that flows to the bottom line. So we'll continue to drive the ROTCE back up as -- if you look back in the areas where there was any front-end -- Fed funds was 2%. We were running a couple of hundred basis points more. It's the huge zero-interest deposit base, especially in consumer and low-interest deposit base that provides a lot of leverage.

And also, behind the scenes, all the changes in a counting, not accounting, but a counting for risk you're increasing capital requirements and without any explicit decision to do so. And we think that, that would be worth probably 100 basis points or so. If you really sat back and thought about it, how do you get there, Mike? Think about our volatility in CCAR outcomes, I think we went from -- we went up by, I don't know, 50, 70 basis points last year, whatever it was. The risk of the company didn't change.

"So Brian, here's the question. Small business optimism is up, and you've got a flat curve at the front end and -- and so I'm kind of wondering how that feeds into C&I demand? And I'm wondering what your conversations with not only small business, mid-business corporates, it'd be really interesting to hear how you think they're preparing for this change?",quarter,Betsy Graseck,Analyst,19,Q and A,Q4_2024,2025-01-16,Bank of America,transcript,"Betsy Graseck (Analyst)

"And to your point, the higher interest rate environment affects them most quickly and importantly because they use lines of credit to do things. Buy a piece of equipment, hire some more people when the payroll dynamics of that, whatever it is. And they might permanently finance that, but immediately, they use lines. And the draw rate’s 400 basis points over where it normally runs, so to speak, which means that they're drawing at less rate, and that probably means they're doing a little less. And so we haven't seen that move a lot. That's a to-come in terms of loan growth, as Alastair mentioned earlier.",quarter,Brian Moynihan,CEO,20,Q and A,Q4_2024,2025-01-16,Bank of America,transcript,"Brian Moynihan (CEO)

"Their belief is that that's changed. And that's why you see the optimism come up, and then we got to translate that optimism into activity, and then you'll see the loan growth come.
