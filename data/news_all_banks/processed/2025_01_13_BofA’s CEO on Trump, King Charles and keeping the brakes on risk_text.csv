"Moynihan was the sixth child, growing up in Ohio in a family of scientists, his father working for the chemicals group, DuPont. He opted for a different path, training as a lawyer and eventually choosing a career that would take him to the summit of Wall Street – and a friendship with King Charles as the chief executive of Bank of America.",bankofamerica,Matthew Garrahan,"BofA's CEO on Trump, King Charles and keeping the brakes on risk",2025-01-13,False
"This month marks 15 years since Moynihan took that job and back in January 2010 the world looked rather different. The global economy was still reeling from the financial crisis, BofA was carrying billions of dollars in bad mortgage assets and a febrile mood had gripped Wall Street. BofA needed a calm figure to lead the clean-up, put the bank back on an even keel and restore investor confidence. It chose Moynihan, who would become Wall Street's quiet man: lacking the brashness of some of his peers, he has pursued a strategy he calls “responsible growth”, shunning many of the riskiest bets in an attempt to avoid the pitfalls of the pre-crisis era.",bankofamerica,Matthew Garrahan,"BofA's CEO on Trump, King Charles and keeping the brakes on risk",2025-01-13,False
"It is a strategy that has largely paid off: from its post-crisis lows, BofA has grown to a market capitalisation around $350bn and is the second-largest US bank, behind JPMorgan. However, the shares of more aggressive rivals with larger investment banking divisions have performed better: for example JPMorgan's share price has risen twice as much as BofA's since the start of 2010.",jpmorgan,Matthew Garrahan,"BofA's CEO on Trump, King Charles and keeping the brakes on risk",2025-01-13,True

"BofA has in recent years taken on more risk, such as building up its markets division. But with the US economy motoring along and incoming president Donald Trump promising a bonfire of regulation, is now the time to take on even more? No, Moynihan says flatly. “We run the company the same way we always run it.""",bankofamerica,Matthew Garrahan,"BofA's CEO on Trump, King Charles and keeping the brakes on risk",2025-01-13,False
"“You've seen that [pushback] happen in other countries”, where people reject being “controlled"" and told ""what to do"", he says. He thinks this happened in the US election and says BofA will ""be the beneficiary of that movement”.",bankofamerica,Matthew Garrahan,"BofA's CEO on Trump, King Charles and keeping the brakes on risk",2025-01-13,False
"The clean up operation in his first few years in charge was arduous, as BofA took big charges and struggled to digest the difficult acquisition of Merrill Lynch. “We disposed of about 50 different operating businesses. We disposed of hundreds of billions of dollars of assets. We had $50bn in private equity we got rid of.""",bankofamerica,Matthew Garrahan,"BofA's CEO on Trump, King Charles and keeping the brakes on risk",2025-01-13,False
"Moynihan tightened the focus on core consumer banking, wealth management, and global corporate investment businesses. “I never doubted the company at all, because we had great people [he calls BofA employees ‘teammates'], great customers, a great franchise and great earnings power. We had a $21bn charge in a single quarter, and I still think we made money that year.”",bankofamerica,Matthew Garrahan,"BofA's CEO on Trump, King Charles and keeping the brakes on risk",2025-01-13,False
"A timely 2011 investment from Warren Buffett sharpened investor minds about the bank's underlying value. “He called and said: I want to put $5bn in.” That year the US “was pretty close to defaulting on its debt”. He told Buffett that BofA did not need the capital. “He said: I know you don't. That's why I'm calling.” Buffett would invest $5bn, striking a deal for a stake with warrants attached that allowed him to eventually buy the shares at $7. They were trading at $5.50 at the time; six years later, when the shares had risen to $24, Buffett used the warrants in a trade that made Berkshire Hathaway billions of dollars.",bankofamerica,Matthew Garrahan,"BofA's CEO on Trump, King Charles and keeping the brakes on risk",2025-01-13,False
"Buffett swooped again for BofA shares in 2020, when markets crashed in the Covid pandemic. The Sage of Omaha has sold down some of his stake recently; the shares these days trade around $44. Moynihan says they have talked “a lot” over the years. “We'd talk about what we see out in the world every once in a while. He doesn't need to sit there and say: tell me what you're doing, because he made [the investment] in the company and the people and us.""",bankofamerica,Matthew Garrahan,"BofA's CEO on Trump, King Charles and keeping the brakes on risk",2025-01-13,False
"But with signs that corporate America may retreat from climate goals during Trump's second term, is the sustainability push under threat? Moynihan says no, pointing out that there are oil and gas companies in the SMI. But BofA, along with Citi and others, did end 2024 by quitting the world's largest climate alliance for banks, retreating on a UN-backed pledge to limit investment in and lending to industries that contribute to greenhouse gas emissions.",citigroup,Matthew Garrahan,"BofA's CEO on Trump, King Charles and keeping the brakes on risk",2025-01-13,True

"The new White House may not agree but Moynihan insists there is still a business opportunity in sustainability. He highlights a debt-for-nature refinancing of central African country Gabon's borrowing, which BofA arranged last year. “They restructured debt, and they took the savings from that and preserved the coral reefs, which capture carbon.” The bank last month arranged a similar deal for Ecuador and its competitors have also jumped into the space.",bankofamerica,Matthew Garrahan,"BofA's CEO on Trump, King Charles and keeping the brakes on risk",2025-01-13,False
