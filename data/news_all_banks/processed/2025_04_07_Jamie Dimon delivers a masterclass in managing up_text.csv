"Every year, JPMorgan chief Jamie Dimon uses his perch as chief of the biggest US bank to expound on how the world should work, via a lengthy letter to shareholders. This year, the primary audience is not so much investors as the White House and its new incumbent. Nonetheless, owners of JPMorgan stock will also thank him for it.",jpmorgan,John Foley,Jamie Dimon delivers a masterclass in managing up,2025-04-07,False
"On tariffs, too, Dimon avoids saying anything too incendiary. He can ill-afford to avoid the topic entirely given JPMorgan's shares have fallen roughly a quarter since mid-February.

But deal-related income is only one-tenth of JPMorgan's revenue in a good year anyway.",jpmorgan,John Foley,Jamie Dimon delivers a masterclass in managing up,2025-04-07,False
"A recession would certainly be bad for borrowers — and for JPMorgan's $233bn credit card loan book — but Dimon's bank is pretty well padded, having provisioned for double its most recently reported loss rates. And of the lending and capital-raising it facilitates, surprisingly little stays on the balance sheet.",jpmorgan,John Foley,Jamie Dimon delivers a masterclass in managing up,2025-04-07,False
"Besides, after nearly two decades in the job, JPMorgan's head does not really need to win over his shareholders. Even with the stock's recent slump, he has handed them an annualised return of over 20 per cent for the past five years.",jpmorgan,John Foley,Jamie Dimon delivers a masterclass in managing up,2025-04-07,False
