"If boss Brian Moynihan has his way, 2025 could well be a breakout year, thanks to the steepening yield curve. The difference between the two and 10-year Treasury yields is currently 39 basis points â€“ around a three year high. But as its fourth-quarter earnings showed, some things weighing on the bank's valuation might get worse before they get better.",bankofamerica,pan.yuk@ft.com,Bank of America still paying the price for being too careful,2025-01-16,False
"Bank of America is one of those. It ploughed money into low-yielding Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities so much during the pandemic that its debt securities holdings doubled between 2019 and 2021, peaking at $980bn.",bankofamerica,pan.yuk@ft.com,Bank of America still paying the price for being too careful,2025-01-16,False
"The logic flipped once the Fed started hiking rates. By March 2024, cash was yielding nearly 5.3 per cent on average while Bank of America's debt securities yielded less than 3 per cent. Worse, the sharp run up in interest rates also resulted in massive paper losses, leaving Moynihan to becalm investors over some $112bn of unrealised losses that quarter.",bankofamerica,pan.yuk@ft.com,Bank of America still paying the price for being too careful,2025-01-16,False
"About $20bn of its fixed-priced loans and securities are maturing each quarter, and Bank of America has been able to redeploy the money at relatively higher rates. But the recent rise in longer-term rates has proved unhelpful, in that it makes bonds fall in value - again. The bank's unrealised losses on bonds it plans to keep until maturity, which had fallen this year, rose in the fourth quarter to $108bn.",bankofamerica,pan.yuk@ft.com,Bank of America still paying the price for being too careful,2025-01-16,False
"Bank of America said on Thursday net interest income could grow by as much as 7 per cent this year, with the return of deposit and loan growth providing an additional tailwind. That compares with the 1.5 per cent increase JPMorgan is forecasting for its own interest income.",bankofamerica,pan.yuk@ft.com,Bank of America still paying the price for being too careful,2025-01-16,True

"Just as at Wall Street rivals, the future of dealmaking and trading looks pretty bright. But more than his large peers, Bank of America's valuation - which currently sits at a middling 1.3 times price to book value - hinges on Moynihan's past balance-sheet decisions - and how soon he can put them behind him.",bankofamerica,pan.yuk@ft.com,Bank of America still paying the price for being too careful,2025-01-16,False
