"Since last September, when chief executive Jane Fraser unveiled what she called Citi's biggest reorganisation in almost two decades, shares in the US's fourth-largest bank by assets have shot up more than 50 per cent. That looks impressive. But it is merely in line with rivals JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America and Wells Fargo. On a price to tangible book value basis, Citi remains heavily discounted. The ratio, at just 0.7 times, is the lowest among the big US banks.",jpmorgan,Pan Yuk,Citigroup's comeback is capped by regulatory threat,2024-10-17,True

The bank is working through two consent orders to fix shortcomings in its risk management, data management and internal controls.",citigroup,Pan Yuk,Citigroup's comeback is capped by regulatory threat,2024-10-17,False
"Despite the bank spending billions since the orders were imposed in 2020, regulators hit Citi with a $136mn fine this summer for insufficient progress. Senator Elizabeth Warren has called for growth restrictions to be placed on the bank, arguing it had become ""too big to manage"". An asset cap, among the harshest punishments regulators impose on US lenders, is a block on increasing the balance sheet above a certain level, curbing revenues and earnings.",citigroup,Pan Yuk,Citigroup's comeback is capped by regulatory threat,2024-10-17,False
