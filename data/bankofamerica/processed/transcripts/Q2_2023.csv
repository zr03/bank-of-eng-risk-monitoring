"Finally, the Tier 1 ratio remains comfortably above our requirements.",quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,9,Prepared remarks,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
"So, let's now focus on loans by looking at average balances, you can see those on Slide 11.",quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,9,Prepared remarks,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
"And there, you can see average loans grew 3% year over year.",quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,9,Prepared remarks,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
"The drivers of loan growth are much the same. Consumer credit card growth is strong, and then commercial loans grew 4%.",quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,9,Prepared remarks,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
"The credit card growth reflects increased marketing, enhanced offers, and higher levels of accounts openings over time.",quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,9,Prepared remarks,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
"And on commercial, we saw a little bit of a slowdown in this quarter driven by higher paydowns from borrowers and weaker customer demand as opposed to any credit availability from us.",quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,9,Prepared remarks,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
We are still open for business for loans.,quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,9,Prepared remarks,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
"So, while loan growth has slowed, it's generally remained still ahead of GDP, and commercial client conversations remain solid as our clients seem to be waiting for some of the economic uncertainty to lift before borrowing further.",quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,9,Prepared remarks,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
"Slide 12 shows the breakout of deposit trends that's on a weekly ending basis across the last two quarters, and it's the same chart that we provided last quarter.",quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,10,Prepared remarks,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
"In the upper left, you can see the trend of total deposits.",quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,10,Prepared remarks,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
"We ended the second quarter at 1.88 trillion, down 1.7%, with several elements of our deposits seeming to find stability.",quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,10,Prepared remarks,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
"Given the normal tax seasonality impacts on deposit balances in Q2 and the monetary policy actions, we believe this is a good result.",quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,10,Prepared remarks,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
"I want to use the other three charts on the page to illustrate the different trends across the last quarter and, more specifically, in each line of business.",quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,10,Prepared remarks,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
"In consumer, looking at the top-right chart, you see the difference in the movement through the quarter between the balances of low to no interest checking accounts and the higher-yielding nonchecking accounts.",quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,10,Prepared remarks,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
"Here, you can also see the low levels of our more rate-sensitive balances in consumer investments and CD balances, and they're both broken out here.",quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,10,Prepared remarks,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
"In total, we've got still more than 1 trillion in high-quality consumer deposits which remains 274 billion above pre-pandemic levels.",quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,10,Prepared remarks,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
"In the second quarter, that decline in consumer deposits was driven by higher debt payments, higher spend, and seasonal tax activity, and some nonchecking balances that rotated from deposits into brokerage accounts.",quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,10,Prepared remarks,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
We did see some competitive pressure this quarter within about roughly $40 billion of CDs as some of the financial institutions pushed prices higher.,quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,10,Prepared remarks,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
"And at this point, with deposits far exceeding our loans, we've not yet felt the need to chase deposits with rate.",quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,10,Prepared remarks,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
"Broadly speaking, average deposit balances of our consumers remain at multiples of their pre-pandemic level, especially in the lower end of our customer base.",quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,10,Prepared remarks,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
Total rate paid on consumer deposits in the quarter rose to 22 basis points and remains low relative to Fed funds driven by the high mix of quality transactional accounts.,quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,10,Prepared remarks,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
Most of this quarter's 10-basis-point rate increase remains concentrated in those CDs and consumer investment deposits.,quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,10,Prepared remarks,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
"And together, those represent only 11% of our consumer deposits.",quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,11,Prepared remarks,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
Turning to wealth management. This business is also impacted by tax payments and normally shows the most relative rate movement because these clients tend to have the most excess cash.,quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,11,Prepared remarks,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
"The previous quarter's trend of clients moving money from lower-yielding sweep accounts into higher-yielding preferred deposits and moving off-balance sheet onto other parts of the platform seemed to stabilize this quarter, and our sweep balances were more modestly down at 72 billion.",quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,11,Prepared remarks,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
"At the bottom right, note the global banking deposits stability.",quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,11,Prepared remarks,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
"We ended the second quarter at 493 billion, down 3 billion from the first quarter.",quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,11,Prepared remarks,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
"We've now been in this 490 billion to 500 billion range for the past several quarters, and these are generally the transactional deposits of our commercial customers that they use to manage their cash flows.",quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,11,Prepared remarks,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
"And while the overall balances have been stable, we've continued to see shift toward interest bearing as the Fed raised rates one more time during the quarter before pausing in June.",quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,11,Prepared remarks,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
Noninterest-bearing deposits were 40% of their deposits at the end of the quarter.,quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,11,Prepared remarks,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
"Focusing for a moment on average deposits using Slide 13, I really only have one additional point to make.",quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,11,Prepared remarks,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
"While you've seen the modest downtick in deposits for the past several quarters as the Fed has removed some accommodation, we just want to note that deposits remain 33% above the fourth-quarter 2019 pre-pandemic period.",quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,11,Prepared remarks,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
"And as you look at the page, every segment relative to pre-pandemic is up at least 15%. Consumers are up 40%.",quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,11,Prepared remarks,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
Consumer checking is up more than 50%.,quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,11,Prepared remarks,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
"And as noted, global banking's being right around 500 billion for the past five quarters, and it remains 31% above pre-pandemic.",quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,11,Prepared remarks,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
"But let's move to Slide 14, and we'll continue the conversation that we began last quarter around management of excess deposits above loans.",quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,11,Prepared remarks,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
"In the top left, note the balances in the second quarter of each year since the pandemic began. The excess of deposits needed to fund loans increased from 500 billion pre-pandemic to a peak of 1.1 trillion in the fall of 2021.",quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,11,Prepared remarks,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
"And as you can see, it remains high at the end of June at 826 billion.",quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,11,Prepared remarks,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
"In the top right, note that the amount of cash and securities held has increased across time, in line with the excess deposit trend. And you'll also note the mix shift over time.",quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,12,Prepared remarks,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
"This excess of deposits over loans has been held in a balanced manner across the period shown with roughly 50% fixed, longer-dated, held-to-maturity securities, and the rest has been held in shorter-dated available-for-sale securities and cash.",quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,12,Prepared remarks,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
Cash and the shorter-dated FS securities combined was 516 billion at the end of the quarter.,quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,12,Prepared remarks,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
"And cash at 375 billion is more than twice what we held pre-pandemic, and you should expect to see that come down over time.",quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,12,Prepared remarks,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
"We made these investments given the mix and transactional nature of our customers deposits, particularly given the excess deposits built.",quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,12,Prepared remarks,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
"Note also in the bottom-left chart, the combined cash and securities yields continue to expand this quarter and remain meaningfully wider than the overall deposit rate paid.",quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,12,Prepared remarks,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
That's a result of two things. Securities book has seen a steady decline since the fall of 2021 when we stopped adding to it.,quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,12,Prepared remarks,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
"With less loan funding needs, proceeds from security paydowns have been deployed into higher-yielding cash.",quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,12,Prepared remarks,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
"And through this action and the increased cash rates, the combined cash and security yield has risen further and faster than deposit rates.",quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,12,Prepared remarks,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
"Deposits at the end of the quarter were paying 124 basis points, while our blend of cash and securities has increased to 319 basis points.",quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,12,Prepared remarks,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
"So, over the past year, the deposit cost has risen by 118 basis points, and the cash and securities yield has improved by 164 basis points.",quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,12,Prepared remarks,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
"And as a reminder, this slide focuses on the banking book because our global markets balance sheet has remained largely market funded.",quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,12,Prepared remarks,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
"Finally, one very last -- one last very important point that I want to make is on the improved NII of our banking book.",quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,12,Prepared remarks,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
"The NII, excluding global markets, which we disclosed each quarter, troughed in the third quarter of 2020 at 9.1 billion, and that compares to 14 billion in the second quarter of 2023.",quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,12,Prepared remarks,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
"So, almost 5 billion higher on a quarter basis, 20 billion per year.",quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,12,Prepared remarks,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
hat's led to a stronger capital position even as we returned capital to shareholders and supplied capital to our customers in the form of loans and other financing capital.,quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,12,Prepared remarks,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
"And then, more specifically, in the hold-to-maturity book, the balance of that portfolio declined again 10 billion from the first quarter.",quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,13,Prepared remarks,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
It's done 69 billion since we stopped adding to the book in the third quarter of '21.,quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,13,Prepared remarks,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
"The market valuation on our hold-to-maturity book, which is in a negative position, worsened 7 billion since March 31st, 2023, driven by a 54-basis-point increase in mortgage rates.",quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,13,Prepared remarks,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
The OCI impact from the valuation of our hedged AFS book modestly improved this quarter.,quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,13,Prepared remarks,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
"Let's turn to Slide 15, and we can focus on net interest income. On a GAAP or non-FTE basis, NII in the second quarter was 14.2 billion, and the fully tax equivalent NII number was 14.3 billion.",quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,13,Prepared remarks,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
"So, I'm going to focus on that fully tax equivalent. Here, NII increased 1.7 billion from the second quarter of '22, or 14 %, while our net interest yield improved 20 basis points to 2.06%.",quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,13,Prepared remarks,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
"This improvement has been driven by rates, which includes securities premium amortization, partially offset by global markets activity, and $137 billion of lower average deposit balances.",quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,13,Prepared remarks,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
Average loan growth during the period of 32 billion also aided the year-over-year NII improvement.,quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,13,Prepared remarks,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
"Turning to a linked-quarter discussion. NII of 14.3 billion is down 289 million, or 2%, from the first quarter.",quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,13,Prepared remarks,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
"And that's driven primarily by the continued impact of lower deposit balances and mix shift into interest-bearing, partially offset by one additional day of interest in the period.",quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,13,Prepared remarks,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
Global markets NII increased during the quarter.,quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,13,Prepared remarks,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
"The net interest yield fell 14 basis points in the quarter, driven by a larger average balance sheet due to the cash positioning we chose and some higher funding costs.",quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,13,Prepared remarks,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
"This quarter's compression, we believe, was just a little anomalous driven by our decision late first quarter to position the balance sheet around higher cash levels.",quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,13,Prepared remarks,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
"Turning to asset sensitivity and focusing on a forward yield curve basis. The plus-100-basis-point parallel shift at June 30th was unchanged from March 31st, '23 at 3.3 billion of expected NII over the next 12 months from our banking book.",quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,13,Prepared remarks,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
And that assumes no expected change in balance sheet levels or mix relative to our baseline forecast. And 95% of the sensitivity remains driven by short rates.,quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,14,Prepared remarks,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
A hundred basis point down rate scenario was unchanged at negative 3.6 billion.,quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,14,Prepared remarks,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
"Let me give you a few thoughts on NII as we look forward. We still believe NII for the full year will be a little above 57 billion, which would be up more than 8% from full-year 2022.",quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,14,Prepared remarks,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
"And this could include third quarter at approximately the same level as second quarter. So, think 14.2, 14.3, and then fourth quarter somewhere around 14 billion.",quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,14,Prepared remarks,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
"That's a slightly better viewpoint than we had last quarter for the third and fourth quarter with a little more stability closer to the second-quarter level and, therefore, provides a better start point for 2024.",quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,14,Prepared remarks,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
"So, let's talk through the caveats around our NII comments.",quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,14,Prepared remarks,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
"First, it assumes that interest rates in the forward curve materialize and an expectation of modest loan growth driven by credit card.",quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,14,Prepared remarks,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
"On deposits, we're expecting modestly lower balances led by consumer, and we expect continued modest deposit mix shifts from global banking deposits into interest-bearing.",quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,14,Prepared remarks,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
"The past few months have provided us a little more positive outlook around NII, given the apparent stabilization of some elements of deposits as well as better pricing.",quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,14,Prepared remarks,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
"And now, we'll see how the rest of the year plays out. OK, let's turn to expense and we'll use Slide 16 for that discussion.",quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,14,Prepared remarks,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
Second-quarter expenses were 16 billion. That was down 200 million from the first quarter.,quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,14,Prepared remarks,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
"And as I mentioned, the second quarter included 276 million of litigation expense.",quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,14,Prepared remarks,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
"In addition, we also saw a little higher revenue-related expense driven by our sales and trading results.",quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,14,Prepared remarks,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
Those higher costs were more than offset by the absence of the first-quarter seasonal elevation of payroll taxes and savings from a reduction in overall full-time headcount.,quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,14,Prepared remarks,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
"So, excluding the 2,500 or so summer interns that we welcomed into our offices over the summer months, our full-time headcount was down roughly 4,000 from the first-quarter start point to 213,000.",quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,14,Prepared remarks,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
"That's some good work after peaking at 218,000 in January.",quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,14,Prepared remarks,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
"Our summer interns will leave us in the third quarter, and hopefully, many will return as full-time associates next summer.",quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,15,Prepared remarks,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
"And at the same time, in Q3, we welcomed back about 2,600 new full-time hires as college grads, many of whom interned with us last summer.",quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,15,Prepared remarks,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
And that's a very diverse class of associates who are excited to join the company.,quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,15,Prepared remarks,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
"As we look forward to next quarter, we would expect the third-quarter expense to more fully benefit from the second-quarter headcount reduction even as we remain in a mode of modest hiring for client-facing positions.",quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,15,Prepared remarks,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
"Additionally, the proposed notice of special assessment from the FDIC to recover losses from the failures of Silicon Valley and Signature banks could add $1.9 billion expense for us, 1.5 billion after tax.",quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,15,Prepared remarks,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
And we just remain unsure at this point of timing to record that expense.,quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,15,Prepared remarks,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
Let's go move to credit and we'll turn to Slide 17.,quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,15,Prepared remarks,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
Net charge-offs of 869 million increased 62 million from the first quarter.,quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,15,Prepared remarks,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
And the increase was driven by credit card losses as higher late-stage delinquencies flowed through to charge-offs.,quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,15,Prepared remarks,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
"For context, the credit card net charge-off rate was 2.6% in Q2 and remains well below the 3.03% pre-pandemic rate in the fourth quarter of '19.",quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,15,Prepared remarks,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
"Provision expense was 1.1 billion in Q2, and that included a 256 million further reserve build.",quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,15,Prepared remarks,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
"That's driven by loan growth, particularly in credit card, and it reflects a macroeconomic outlook that, on a weighted basis, continues to include an unemployment rate that rises to north of 5% in 2024.",quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,15,Prepared remarks,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
"On Slide 18, we highlight the credit quality metrics for both our consumer and commercial portfolios.",quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,15,Prepared remarks,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
"On consumer, we note we continue to see asset quality metrics come off the bottom, and they remain below historical averages.",quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,15,Prepared remarks,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
"Overall, commercial net charge-offs were flat from first quarter.",quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,15,Prepared remarks,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
"And within commercial, we saw a decrease in C&I losses that was offset by an increase in charge-offs related to commercial real estate office exposures.",quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,15,Prepared remarks,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
"As a reminder, commercial real estate office credit exposure represents less than 2% of our total loans.",quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,15,Prepared remarks,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
"And this is an area where we've been quite intentional around our client selection, portfolio concentration, and deal structure over many years.",quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,15,Prepared remarks,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
"And as a result, we've seen NPLs and realized losses that are quite low for this portfolio.",quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,16,Prepared remarks,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
"In the second quarter, we experienced 17 million in charge-offs on office exposure to write down a handful of properties where the LTV has deteriorated.",quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,16,Prepared remarks,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
Our charge-offs on office exposures were 15 million in the first quarter.,quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,16,Prepared remarks,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
We pulled forward some of the office portfolio stats provided last quarter in a slide in our appendix for you.,quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,16,Prepared remarks,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
And we continue to believe that the portfolio is well positioned and adequately reserved against the current conditions.,quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,16,Prepared remarks,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
"Moving to the various lines of business and their results, starting on Slide 19 with consumer banking.",quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,16,Prepared remarks,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
"For the quarter, consumer earned 2.9 billion on good organic revenue growth and delivered its ninth consecutive quarter of strong operating leverage while we continue to invest in our future.",quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,16,Prepared remarks,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
"Note that top-line revenue grew 15%, while expense rose 10%.",quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,16,Prepared remarks,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
These segment results include the bulk of the impact of the costs of the regulatory agreements from last week.,quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,16,Prepared remarks,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
Or reported earnings were strong in both periods at 2.9 billion. It understates the success of the business because the prior year included reserve releases while we built reserves this quarter for card growth.,quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,16,Prepared remarks,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
"PPNR grew 21% year over year even with the added cost of the agreements, and the revenue growth overcame a decline in service charges that I noted earlier.",quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,16,Prepared remarks,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
"Much of this success is driven by the pace of organic growth of checking and card accounts, as well as investment accounts and balances, as Brian noted earlier.",quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,16,Prepared remarks,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
"In addition to the litigation noted, expense reflects the continued business investments for growth.",quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,16,Prepared remarks,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
"And as you think about this business, remember, much of the company's minimum wage hikes and the midyear increased salary and wage moves in 2022 impact consumer banking the most, and that, therefore, impacts the year-over-year comparisons.",quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,16,Prepared remarks,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
"Moving to wealth management on Slide 20. We produced good results, earning a little less than $1 billion.",quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,16,Prepared remarks,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
"These results were down from last year as asset management and brokerage fees felt the negative impact of lower-equity, lower fixed-income markets, and some market uncertainty impacting transactional volume.",quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,16,Prepared remarks,Q2_2023,2023-07-18

"With modest loan growth on average year over year and linked quarter, the utilization rates declined, and more generally, we saw lower levels of demand.",quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,17,Prepared remarks,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
"As we noted earlier, the deposit flows have stabilized in the $490 billion to $500 billion range over the past several quarters, reflecting the benefits of our strong client relationships.",quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,17,Prepared remarks,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
"The company's overall investment banking fees were 1.2 billion in the second quarter, growing 7% over the prior year and 4% linked quarter, a good performance in a sluggish environment that saw fee pools down 20% year over year.",quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,17,Prepared remarks,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
Provision expense declined year over year as we built more reserve in the prior year.,quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,17,Prepared remarks,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
"Expense was held relatively flat year over year even as we drove strategic investments in the business, including relationship management hiring and technology costs.",quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,17,Prepared remarks,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
"And additionally, comparisons benefit from the absence of elevated expense for some regulatory matters in the second quarter of '22.",quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,17,Prepared remarks,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
Switching to global markets on Slide 22. Team had another strong quarter with earnings growing to 1.2 billion driven by revenue growth of 14%.,quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,18,Prepared remarks,Q2_2023,2023-07-18

The investments made in the business over the past two years continue to produce favorable results.,quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,18,Prepared remarks,Q2_2023,2023-07-18

"Finally on Slide 23, all other shows a loss of 182 million.",quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,18,Prepared remarks,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
Revenue included 197 million of losses on security sales and increased volume of solar and wind investment operating losses that create the tax credits for the company.,quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,18,Prepared remarks,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
"As a result of the increased solar and wind tax deal volume and their associated related operating losses, our effective tax rate in the quarter was lower 8%.",quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,18,Prepared remarks,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
"But excluding ESG and any other discrete tax benefits, our tax rate would have been 26%.",quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,18,Prepared remarks,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
"So with that, let's stop there, and we'll open it up for Q&A.",quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,18,Prepared remarks,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
[Operator instructions] We'll take our first question today from Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Your line is open.,quarter,Operator,Host,19,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
"Thank you. Good morning, Brian. Good morning, Alastair.",quarter,Gerard Cassidy,Analyst,19,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
"Brian, can you give us a view from your standpoint of the -- the new proposal -- or when I say new but the speech by Vice Chair Barr about the likelihood of capital ratios going up for large banks like your own?",quarter,Gerard Cassidy,Analyst,19,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
"And then second, there was a report today on Bloomberg that the capital requirements for holding residential mortgages may go up meaningfully. Any thoughts on that as well?",quarter,Gerard Cassidy,Analyst,19,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
"I think, broadly stated, I think, as was said by many people that have held the position over the years, the capital industry is sufficient.",quarter,Brian Moynihan,CEO,19,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
"And I think there's been a desire to finish up the Basel III. Those rules will come out, we think, in a few weeks.",quarter,Brian Moynihan,CEO,19,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
"And, you know, like anything else, we'll deal with them. We have 11.6% CET 1 ratio. Our requirements currently are 10.4.",quarter,Brian Moynihan,CEO,19,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
"And so, we've got plenty of capital and it's built up.",quarter,Brian Moynihan,CEO,19,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
"So, you know, I think, from the global competitive standpoint, we've got to be careful here because the U.S. industry is the best industry in the -- in the world and actually does a lot of good for all the countries including the U.S.",quarter,Brian Moynihan,CEO,19,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
"And -- and frankly, the rules applied tend to be more favorable to those outside our country. And so, we ought to be careful to maintain that competitive parity.",quarter,Brian Moynihan,CEO,19,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
"But at the end of the day, Gerard, you know, you need to finish this and get this behind us and then the industry will adopt and move forward.",quarter,Brian Moynihan,CEO,20,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
And -- but they've got to think through the downside of some of these rules and that they can push stuff outside the industry to nonbanks to half the asset classes across the board.,quarter,Brian Moynihan,CEO,20,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
"And nonbanks, including mortgage lending, which you referenced, half of it goes through nonbanks.",quarter,Brian Moynihan,CEO,20,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
And those -- the resilience of those institutions is interesting to watch through cycles.,quarter,Brian Moynihan,CEO,20,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
"And then, the second thing they have to worry about is competitiveness overall.",quarter,Brian Moynihan,CEO,20,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
"But and then, also just slowing down the economy, a 10% increase in our capital levels would disable us from making about $150 billion of loans at the margin. And you want our banks to support the economy like we do.",quarter,Brian Moynihan,CEO,20,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
"So, I think all of this has to be balanced out as they go to adopt these rules.",quarter,Brian Moynihan,CEO,20,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
"Very good. And then, as a follow-up, Alastair, you talked about the balance sheet.",quarter,Gerard Cassidy,Analyst,20,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
"I think you said 100-basis-point increase would lead to over $3 billion in net interest revenue growth over the next 12 months, and 100-basis-point decrease would lead to a decline of just over $3 billion in Revenue.",quarter,Gerard Cassidy,Analyst,20,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
"Can you share with us, when do you think you might change -- or what would make you change that position to be liability sensitive?",quarter,Gerard Cassidy,Analyst,20,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
Would you rely on the forward curve? Or what's the outlook for the balance sheet management that you're looking at now?,quarter,Gerard Cassidy,Analyst,20,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
"Well, Gerard, I don't think much has changed for us. We've talked about the fact that, you know, for us, it's this idea of balance that's key.",quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,20,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
"And if you look at our disclosures around interest rate risk over the course of the past couple of years, you'll see it's -- it's more balanced, both upside and downside.",quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,20,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
"And it's a narrower corridor over time. So, we're trying to sustain NII at a higher level for longer. That's what we're trying to engineer.",quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,21,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
"So, I think, going forward, there won't be a lot of change to our philosophy in that regard. We feel like we're in a pretty good position in terms of balance.",quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,21,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
"We'll be tweaking at the margin, but what will largely drive things from here is just normalization of deposits and -- and good old-fashioned loan growth.",quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,21,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
Very good. Thank you.,quarter,Gerard Cassidy,Analyst,21,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
We'll go next to Glenn Schorr with Evercore. Your line is open.,quarter,Operator,Host,21,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
"Hey, Glenn.",quarter,Brian Moynihan,CEO,21,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
"Good morning. So, no one could take issue with 600 basis points of operating leverage, but I just always like doing a little gut check.",quarter,Glenn Schorr,Analyst,21,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
"Expenses, up 5%. I heard all the reasons why a lot of investment, the FDIC charges coming, but I just want to make sure, did anything change?",quarter,Glenn Schorr,Analyst,21,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
"Over the, like, last decade or so, you've been basically flat for life. Is expenses more of a relative gain relative to revenues?",quarter,Glenn Schorr,Analyst,21,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
Or do you think you can keep expenses in and around the same area as you continue to invest? Thanks.,quarter,Glenn Schorr,Analyst,21,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
"I -- so, Glenn, I think Alastair gave you a trajectory, which if you look at it from fourth quarter last year to the fourth quarter this year, gets relatively flat year over year.",quarter,Brian Moynihan,CEO,22,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
"And as revenues flatten out because the interest rate movements flatten out, you know, you'll see that, as we decline in the quarters, that'll be strong.",quarter,Brian Moynihan,CEO,22,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
"So, if we think about it, the -- as we think about the forward, you know, we think about the -- the ability to control headcount and have expenses continue to come down.",quarter,Brian Moynihan,CEO,22,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
"But they're going to stay, you know, at a level that's relatively consistent where we are now over time. And the goal is then to grow revenue faster than expense.",quarter,Brian Moynihan,CEO,22,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
We've been doing it for many decades. You can see that in our data.,quarter,Brian Moynihan,CEO,22,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
"And -- and -- but the way we do it differs, you know, from five years ago to 10 years ago to last year.",quarter,Brian Moynihan,CEO,22,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
"And that the ability to, you know, move the branch configuration around when we had 6,000 branches down to 4,000 or 3,900, 3,800 is different from 3,800 to where it might end up.",quarter,Brian Moynihan,CEO,22,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
"And so, you should expect us to continue to engineer by applying massive amounts of technology.",quarter,Brian Moynihan,CEO,22,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
"Erica saves a lot of transactional activity. Zelle saves a lot of transactional activity deposits by mobile phone, saves a lot of activity, all that goes on.",quarter,Brian Moynihan,CEO,22,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
"And then, what we're offsetting with that is from the decade that you talk about, we probably went from 2.5 billion of technology initiatives a year to 3.8 billion.",quarter,Brian Moynihan,CEO,22,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
"And we went -- we have a lot more revenue that's compensated for, thinking about in the wealth management business.",quarter,Brian Moynihan,CEO,22,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
"And that's -- those are things we fight all the time. So, we expect to manage expenses in line with the revenue.",quarter,Brian Moynihan,CEO,22,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
"As we got to '19, we told you that we're going to have to start growing expenses at a modestly -- modest growth rate relative to the revenue growth rate.",quarter,Brian Moynihan,CEO,22,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
"We'd outgrow the economy on revenue, and expenses will grow a couple hundred basis points lower.",quarter,Brian Moynihan,CEO,22,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
"We're kind of going to be back in that mode, frankly. It's just, with inflation, they kicked up, and now, we flatten it back out and then we'll get back in sync as we move to '24 and beyond.",quarter,Brian Moynihan,CEO,22,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
"And, Glenn, look, the only thing I would just add to what Brian just said, you know, we put up 16.2 in the first quarter. We were 16-ish this quarter.",quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,23,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
"Obviously, yeah, we kind of feel like, next quarter, just with all the work that we've done around headcount and getting the firm in the place that we want now, we feel like we're well positioned to deliver 15.8 this quarter.",quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,23,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
"If we -- when we keep going, we think we're going to be somewhere around 15.6 or so in Q4.",quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,23,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
"So, to Brian's point, number one, we like the trajectory now. We've shaped the headcount over time to get to the place where we want it to be, and that would compare -- I think Q4 of last year was 15.5.",quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,23,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
"So, when you talk about that sort of flattish idea, in an inflationary environment, we feel like that's a pretty good way to end this year and a pretty good way to set up for next year.",quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,23,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
Totally agree. Thanks for all that. I appreciate it.,quarter,Glenn Schorr,Analyst,23,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
We'll take our next question from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.,quarter,Operator,Host,23,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
"Good morning, Mike.",quarter,Brian Moynihan,CEO,23,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
"Hey, good morning. So, I don't think consensus has you with positive outcome of the third and fourth quarter.",quarter,Mike Mayo,Analyst,23,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
"And I just want to make sure I heard you correctly, Brian, on your opening remark. You expect that eight quarters of consecutive positive operating leverage to continue.",quarter,Mike Mayo,Analyst,23,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
"So, you expect nine quarters or 10 quarters or as long as you can, and on the -- one reason is just the NII headwinds.",quarter,Mike Mayo,Analyst,23,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
"You said it should be kind of flattish in the third quarter, which -- and then down some in the fourth quarter.",quarter,Mike Mayo,Analyst,24,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
You said the commercial loan demand is a little bit less and utilization is less.,quarter,Mike Mayo,Analyst,24,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
"On the other hand, you did this give some specific expense numbers. And maybe, I guess the specific question is, how long do you expect those eight quarters last?",quarter,Mike Mayo,Analyst,24,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
Are we done with that? Do you expect that to go?,quarter,Mike Mayo,Analyst,24,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
"And then, to what degree do your digital efforts, you know, your first three slides, 4, 5, and 6, play a part in sustaining this positive operating leverage, say, through 2024 and 2025?",quarter,Mike Mayo,Analyst,24,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
Is that a goal? Is that an expectation?,quarter,Mike Mayo,Analyst,24,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
"I -- our goal is always to maintain it. And like you point out, that the toughest time was when you have sort of a twist in the interest rate environment, and you could see that at the end of '19.",quarter,Brian Moynihan,CEO,24,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
"And then, we got right back into it right after the environment stabilized.",quarter,Brian Moynihan,CEO,24,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
"But, you know, I think about the question you asked me a few years ago, Mike, was, you know, when NII is coming in, are you going to let it fall the bottom line, are you going to spend it?",quarter,Brian Moynihan,CEO,24,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
"And about 80-plus percent of it has fallen to the bottom line, which shows you how we position the franchise from, you know, the second quarter of '21 till now as we went through the interest rate -- the fast interest rate raising.",quarter,Brian Moynihan,CEO,24,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
"So, we gave you the specific -- as you said, the specific expense guidance by quarter.",quarter,Brian Moynihan,CEO,24,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
"We'd expect that should produce operating leverage. We'll be hit -- it gets tougher and then it will get easier as we start to see the stabilization of deposits and loans and loan growth, you know, sort of routinely come through and the economy, frankly, shaking through whether we're going to have a recession or not.",quarter,Brian Moynihan,CEO,24,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
"And so, we feel good about what we've done. That's why I tried to give that longer period of time, so people have the context.",quarter,Brian Moynihan,CEO,24,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
"It's very different environments how we've achieved it. Sometimes, revenue fell and expense fell faster.",quarter,Brian Moynihan,CEO,24,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
"Sometimes, revenue grew and expense grew but slower and, you know, all the different ways.",quarter,Brian Moynihan,CEO,24,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
"So, we'll keep working at it. The key leading indicator we like is we've been able to manage the headcount down, as Alastair said earlier.",quarter,Brian Moynihan,CEO,25,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
"And frankly, that is in the face of a turnover rate year over year which has dropped in half, which is good because then we're not training and hiring as many people.",quarter,Brian Moynihan,CEO,25,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
"And that then sets us up for the second half of the year because that headcount benefit has not really come through the P&L, and we'll offset some of the other inflation.",quarter,Brian Moynihan,CEO,25,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
"And then, as relates to NII specifically, you said that the last few months, you're a little bit more confident given stabilization in pricing.",quarter,Mike Mayo,Analyst,25,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
"I guess we're not seeing that every bank, right? Some bank getting worse, some banks getting better.",quarter,Mike Mayo,Analyst,25,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
"So, what is it that gives you more confidence on the NII front and the deposit stabilization front?",quarter,Mike Mayo,Analyst,25,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
"Well, I can't -- look, I can't speak to the other banks, Mike, but obviously, we know we're in a privileged and advantaged position relative to our client base.",quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,25,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
"I just think it's interesting, you look at that global banking set of results over the course of the past year and a half in particular, that's extraordinary resilience.",quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,25,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
"And, look, Q2 is tax season. So, you look at the wealth management business, for example, deposits were down 9 billion, but we know they paid tax payments of, you know, 14 billion, 15 billion, 16 billion last quarter.",quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,25,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
"So, there's beginning to be a little more stability. And obviously, our focus has always been on transactional primary operating, and we're maybe seeing the benefit of that in some degree.",quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,25,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
"But we'll -- we show you on slide -- I think it was Page 12 of the earnings deck, that's where it is. And we showed that last quarter.",quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,25,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
"We show it again next quarter. But it's just, you know, the Fed's engineering this across the board, and we're just reacting to what we see from our customer base.",quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,25,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
OK. Thank you.,quarter,Mike Mayo,Analyst,26,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
We'll take our next question from Jim Mitchell with Seaport Global. Your line is open.,quarter,Operator,Host,26,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
"Hey, good morning. Maybe just a follow-up on -- on deposit behavior.",quarter,Jim Mitchell,Analyst,26,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
"I appreciate the comment that you have very low loan-to-deposit ratio, you know, off to chase rates.",quarter,Jim Mitchell,Analyst,26,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
"So, it feels like betas can stay low. But how do you think about -- how are you thinking about the mix going forward?",quarter,Jim Mitchell,Analyst,26,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
"We are seeing NIDs come down, CD demand is picking up. So, how are you thinking -- what are you seeing in your deposit base with respect to mix?",quarter,Jim Mitchell,Analyst,26,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
"I think, Jim, one of the things that, as we think about deposits, we think about across each of the customer bases and that's what Page 12 shows you.",quarter,Brian Moynihan,CEO,26,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
"We think about what do they have cash flows for. They have cash to transact, and they have cash that's in excess of that.",quarter,Brian Moynihan,CEO,26,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
"And what happens is, depending on the customer segment, that cash moves to the market, that excess cash moves the market. But the transactional cash is all with us.",quarter,Brian Moynihan,CEO,26,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
"That transactional cash far exceeds for us our -- our loan balances. So, we have excess transactional cash.",quarter,Brian Moynihan,CEO,26,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
"And a lot of it is low-interest checking, no-interest checking. Even if it's a money market, it's that sort of cushion that consumers and wealthy people -- wealthy consumers and average consumers maintain to pay their bills and unexpected expenses.",quarter,Brian Moynihan,CEO,26,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
"So, that's what you've seen, and that produces a cost of deposits of 1.24, which is far different than we see other people have.",quarter,Brian Moynihan,CEO,27,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
"And that -- that you can't -- that's just happened. So, now, the question is how much moves.",quarter,Brian Moynihan,CEO,27,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
"And as Alastair said earlier, we're after tax time now where we have a big wealth management payout to the -- to the -- to taxes.",quarter,Brian Moynihan,CEO,27,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
"We also are past the point where people have -- way past the point in the last stimulus payments where people have to -- that money's been in accounts, and still is in their accounts, to a large degree as we -- as we look at them.",quarter,Brian Moynihan,CEO,27,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
"And they're paying that down slowly, so the average balance in our checking accounts has gone from a high of 11,000 at the peak to 10,000, you know, now to 600 or 500, something like that.",quarter,Brian Moynihan,CEO,27,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
"So, all that dynamic. But you've got to go back and say it's the mix of interest bearing and noninterest bearing is actually a little bit of a misnomer because it's really what the customer uses it to cash for.",quarter,Brian Moynihan,CEO,27,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
"And if they use it to transact and run their household, that's a very stable base. And that's what this data shows across time and is fundamentally a lot higher than pre-pandemic.",quarter,Brian Moynihan,CEO,27,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
"So, consumers, 700 billion pre-pandemic, a trillion now.",quarter,Brian Moynihan,CEO,27,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
"Checking of that, if you look on the -- on the pages in the deposit descriptions, you'll see those numbers are on Page 13, I think it is. Those numbers will show you how much has stayed in checking.",quarter,Brian Moynihan,CEO,27,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
"That's because, hey, we have more customers, but more importantly, the average consumer, you know, through inflation and stuff, has more money around.",quarter,Brian Moynihan,CEO,27,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
And that -- that provides great grist for the mill.,quarter,Brian Moynihan,CEO,27,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
Right. Did you feel like that mix shift is starting to slow and stabilize?,quarter,Jim Mitchell,Analyst,27,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
"Well, that's what the data on Page 12 shows you. That's why we -- we show you this level of detail in our customer bases, our lines of business that many don't show you, to demonstrate that -- that differences there for us.",quarter,Brian Moynihan,CEO,27,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
And other people may be there too. I just can't find it in their data.,quarter,Brian Moynihan,CEO,28,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
"But if you look at -- that's why we show you Page 12. So, as you see, during the second quarter, you have the week-by-week average balance movement.",quarter,Brian Moynihan,CEO,28,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
"And it's -- as Alastair said earlier, you know, the -- it's very stable in GWIM, it's very stable in global banking, even in noninterest-bearing piece.",quarter,Brian Moynihan,CEO,28,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
"Half of that is excess balance, half of it is earnings credit rate through the GTS process. And so, you've got to be careful of that.",quarter,Brian Moynihan,CEO,28,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
"And when you look at the consumer and it's bouncing around the high, you know, $980 billion to $1 trillion depending on the thing and then add a trillion, and that happens when payrolls happen, all that stuff that -- that's hugely advantaged pricing.",quarter,Brian Moynihan,CEO,28,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
Twenty-odd basis points in total for the consumer business. And you asked about CDs. We only have 40 billion of CDs.,quarter,Brian Moynihan,CEO,28,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
"So, we -- we are -- what our customers are asking for CD rates, we give them too. It's just not the core business.",quarter,Brian Moynihan,CEO,28,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
"And then, we have the investment side. We push, you know, those wealth management flows, and the consumer investment flows are part of our deposits moving over to the market when it's excess cash.",quarter,Brian Moynihan,CEO,28,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
Right. All very helpful. Thanks a lot.,quarter,Jim Mitchell,Analyst,28,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
We'll go next to Chris Kotowski with Oppenheimer. Your line is open.,quarter,Operator,Host,28,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
Yeah. Good morning and thanks for taking the question.,quarter,Chris Kotowski,Analyst,28,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
"In the press release, for last week's settlement, CFPB Director Chopra alleged that you, among other things, opened customer accounts without consent.",quarter,Chris Kotowski,Analyst,28,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
"And I'm just wondering how is such a thing possible in the post-Wells Fargo era. And -- and can you compare and contrast, you know, what happened with -- at your firm with what happened at Wells?",quarter,Chris Kotowski,Analyst,29,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
"Quite frankly, Chris, when we went all through the horizontal review by the OCC and all the practices and everything were changed then, and these -- the small number of accounts that are part of this from that time period, it's just that not the other agencies, you know, did anything, and then the consumer bureau had to -- sitting around, we kind of cleaned it up this quarter.",quarter,Brian Moynihan,CEO,29,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
"So, that was -- that was that one.",quarter,Brian Moynihan,CEO,29,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
The time period -- reflects which time period?,quarter,Chris Kotowski,Analyst,29,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
"It reflects up to the current time, but the accounts were from, you know, '16 -- '16 and before, '17, back when -- remember, the comptroller, Curry, did the three-phase review of all the other firms, and they didn't find, you know -- you can go look at the data and then all the way up to the next comptroller testified in Congress.",quarter,Brian Moynihan,CEO,29,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
"And, you know, starting the Obama administration after Wells and then led into the early part of the Trump administration with Otting -- Comptroller Otting and you can go look, that -- that was cleared up.",quarter,Brian Moynihan,CEO,29,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
And we made the changes in those processes at that time.,quarter,Brian Moynihan,CEO,29,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
OK. Thank you. That's it for me.,quarter,Chris Kotowski,Analyst,29,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
We'll go next to Erika Najarian with UBS. Your line is open.,quarter,Operator,Host,29,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
"Erika, you might be on mute. Operator, maybe we can come back to Erika.",quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,30,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
Absolutely. We'll go next to Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.,quarter,Operator,Host,30,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
"Hi, good morning.",quarter,Betsy Graseck,Analyst,30,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
"Morning, Betsy.",quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,30,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
A couple of questions. One on the operating leverage that I know you discussed earlier.,quarter,Betsy Graseck,Analyst,30,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
"I mean, in the past, when you had the record number of consecutive quarters of positive operating leverage, it seemed like it was being driven primarily [Audio gap] a lot of inputs.",quarter,Betsy Graseck,Analyst,30,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
"But one of the big drivers was consolidation of branches, and now, it's an investment spend environment in branches. So, I'm just wondering if there is -- if you would agree with that, and if there's a different way that you're going to be delivering this positive operating leverage as you're increasing investment spend in one of the, you know, core platforms of the company.",quarter,Betsy Graseck,Analyst,30,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
"Betsy, that's kind of what I said earlier. It's been gotten by different ways in different periods of time.",quarter,Brian Moynihan,CEO,30,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
"But even in the last year, the number of branches, I think, dropped about from 3,900 to 3,800 and change, and so even as we deployed new ones.",quarter,Brian Moynihan,CEO,31,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
"And so, you're consolidating branches in markets you've been in a long time with lots of branches. You know, the ATM count continues to drift down.",quarter,Brian Moynihan,CEO,31,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
"But importantly, if you go to the digital pages and look at the activity levels by customers, and you're speaking mostly the consumer business but it affects all customer bases, and you see things like Zelle transactions far exceeding checks, remember that what that means is we don't have to process a check on the back end of that.",quarter,Brian Moynihan,CEO,31,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
"And so -- and you process it, push it through. So, all that continues to grow very quickly and continues to change the overall operating costs in our consumer business.",quarter,Brian Moynihan,CEO,31,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
Your cost of operating plus the cost of pays and deposits is still 130-odd basis points or whatever. It's very strong.,quarter,Brian Moynihan,CEO,31,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
"If you go where the big moves are coming is what we're doing in the markets business, say, for example, in terms of deeper, deeper digitization, there's always, you know, equity trading was always digitized, but the operational process behind that, the throughput of the amount of stuff, that's going straight through.",quarter,Brian Moynihan,CEO,31,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
"And then, what's behind that also -- and the wealth management customers getting their statements, you know, and statements not being delivered to customers home but delivered at [Inaudible] a half billion dollars annual benefit that's accumulated over time.",quarter,Brian Moynihan,CEO,31,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
"And so, if there was some magic thing you could pull, you know, you'd pull it, but these are a whole bunch of operational excellence ideas.",quarter,Brian Moynihan,CEO,31,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
"It seems inchmeal to the general public, but it just is a constant improvement of the platform, allows us to constantly manage people down as a -- as a percentage of the work done by people always comes down.",quarter,Brian Moynihan,CEO,31,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
"And then, now with artificial intelligence and all the enthusiasm, leave aside that's in the future, the way we've applied it so far has enabled us to do things like our business bankers are more efficient at calling because we use -- we use artificial intelligence and programs to tell them which prospects to go to, not to tell -- they know their clients and they run it, but which prospects they should approach first.",quarter,Brian Moynihan,CEO,31,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
"So, they're more efficient. Or the Advisor Match, which, you know, has an intelligence base built into it to match a client to an advisor.",quarter,Brian Moynihan,CEO,31,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
"That's -- you know, you saw the statistics about the numbers of leads, 20,000 leads. You know, all this is adding efficiency.",quarter,Brian Moynihan,CEO,32,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
"So, yes, the branch system has got -- you know, if it come -- it's come down a slope and that slope's starting to flat now.",quarter,Brian Moynihan,CEO,32,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
"But in that slope is a massive reinvestment in rehabs and a massive opening and then more and more deposits over top of that, which keep that efficiency going.",quarter,Brian Moynihan,CEO,32,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
"So, your point on enthusiasm for AI, but in your -- in your comments, it sounds like there's more legs to that that you're anticipating going forward as well. Is that fair?",quarter,Betsy Graseck,Analyst,32,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
"Yeah. Erica, we started working on probably eight years ago now to do a natural language processing capability that could answer questions that we can make sure the answer was what we wanted to be and that ran on our proprietary systems.",quarter,Brian Moynihan,CEO,32,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
"And so, it's an algorithm that anticipates the answer to the question, but it comes from our data and it looks in your account.",quarter,Brian Moynihan,CEO,32,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
"But those 165 million interactions in the last quarter, all of them would have been an email, a text, a phone call, and they were all done, you know, through the customer entering it into Erica and getting an answer and then going on and started -- but that would just keep expanding to become a higher and higher functionality.",quarter,Brian Moynihan,CEO,32,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
"It is a start at a methodology which, you know, these new programs are far in excess of that, but they're not tested on data.",quarter,Brian Moynihan,CEO,32,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
"They hallucinate and all these wonderful things that you hear the experts talk about. That have to be carefully controlled before you apply, but Erica is using some of the same principles but applied in a very controlled environment.",quarter,Brian Moynihan,CEO,32,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
"And, by the way, when we do it with our -- drafting the CO, credit offer memoranda, or we do it with a business -- targeting that we talked about, you know, all those are ways that we apply it, but it's a very controlled setting.",quarter,Brian Moynihan,CEO,32,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
"So, it has a lot more out there, frankly, as it gets understood better and how it works better and how it can -- attribution, accountability, those types of things have to build in.",quarter,Brian Moynihan,CEO,33,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
"But Erica, that was built in from the start.",quarter,Brian Moynihan,CEO,33,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
"OK, thanks. And then, just one follow-up on the capital question.",quarter,Betsy Graseck,Analyst,33,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
"I know that you are reviewing the SCB with the Fed, but I'm just trying to understand what kind of expectations you have for buybacks as we look forward here, realizing that, you know, there's some puts and takes with Basel III, but there's some benefits here with the SCB. Thanks.",quarter,Betsy Graseck,Analyst,33,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
"Yeah, so we got the final stress capital buffer along with the rest of the industry in August. So, we'll wait for that, obviously.",quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,33,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
"And then, Betsy, I think we'll likely have to wait for Basel III final clarity. That's still moving.",quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,33,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
"That said, we don't have the proposed rule yet, then we have to wait for the comment period, then we got to wait for the final rule.",quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,33,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
"So, there's a lot that needs to go on before we get full perspective. I think Brian said it well.",quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,33,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
"I mean, we've got plenty of capital. We've been buying back enough shares to offset the share dilution, and we've got flexibility to do a little bit more.",quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,33,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
"So, the other thing that you see over the course of the past year is obviously stress capital buffer last year meant we had to add 90 basis points.",quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,33,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
"Well, we've had 110 over the course of the past year and kept return on tangible common equity around 15.5% while buying back shares.",quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,33,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
"So, we've got the flexibility to do a little bit of everything. But I think we want to see what the final rules look like before we make too many decisions.",quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,33,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
Yeah.,quarter,Brian Moynihan,CEO,34,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
All right. Thank you.,quarter,Betsy Graseck,Analyst,34,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
We'll go next to Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Your line is open.,quarter,Operator,Host,34,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
"Morning, Ken.",quarter,Brian Moynihan,CEO,34,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
Hi. Good morning. Just one question on -- on -- on credit to follow up your comments.,quarter,Ken Usdin,Analyst,34,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
"So, it looks like the card normalization is progressing very gradually, 90 days past dues, but only kind of marginally.",quarter,Ken Usdin,Analyst,34,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
"Just -- just your points about the consumer having still plenty of cash, the economy holding up well, just your view on just ongoing normalization of -- of card losses, specifically.",quarter,Ken Usdin,Analyst,34,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
And just anything else that we should be mindful of when we think about credit normalization? Thank you.,quarter,Ken Usdin,Analyst,34,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
"Ken, I think I think you nailed it, that's sort of been -- you just -- you watch our, you know -- if you look at our charge-offs, for example, that's mainly about loan growth and a little bit about the rate picking up just a little bit.",quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,34,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
"But it's still well below pandemic, you can see that.",quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,34,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
"And fourth quarter '19 was a great quarter for asset quality and cards. So, it gets back to this idea that the consumer is still in a pretty healthy place.",quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,34,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
"You can see that in the unemployment statistics, and you can see it in the way that they're just continuing to spend a little bit more money year over year.",quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,35,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
"So, you know, I feel like we've been pretty consistent. The consumer is pretty resilient. That remains the case, and we're benefiting it from right now and the card experience.",quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,35,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
"And thanks. So, just one more follow-up on the fees side.",quarter,Ken Usdin,Analyst,35,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
"Can you help us understand, you know, the card, the deposit service charges, asset management kind of all been stable to slightly lower have the effect that you put through in terms of all the service charges changes and new rewards type of card benefits and all that?",quarter,Ken Usdin,Analyst,35,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
"Are we close to getting that run rated, and any signals of stability in some of those areas?",quarter,Ken Usdin,Analyst,35,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
"So, as Alastair mentioned earlier, there's been a 10-year change in how we work in the overdraft area.",quarter,Brian Moynihan,CEO,35,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
"And the biggest -- and another set of changes were made and fully implemented in the third quarter of last year. So, they're in the current run rate.",quarter,Brian Moynihan,CEO,35,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
It's just year-over-year comparisons. This quarter picks up a little bit of pre-final changes to post.,quarter,Brian Moynihan,CEO,35,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
"So, if you look at the FDIC data, I think we're down to $30-odd million a quarter or something like that and -- in overdraft fees compared to others that are multiples of that.",quarter,Brian Moynihan,CEO,35,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
But it's all through the system. It's all done and all the changes required of -- under the recent announcements and stuff that have been made for a couple of years.,quarter,Brian Moynihan,CEO,35,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
"So, it's -- it's in the run rate, so to speak.",quarter,Brian Moynihan,CEO,35,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
Right. Thanks a lot. Got it.,quarter,Ken Usdin,Analyst,35,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
[Operator instructions] We'll go next to Charles Peabody with Portales. Your line is open.,quarter,Operator,Host,36,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
"Good morning. Question about your interest-bearing deposits with the Fed, and I'm looking at Page 8, your average balance sheet.",quarter,Charles Peabody,Analyst,36,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
"And those balances were up quite considerably quarter over quarter, and yet your deposit base was relatively flat.",quarter,Charles Peabody,Analyst,36,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
So. I was just curious what the thinking behind that was. Was it a desire to build liquidity? Was there an arbitrage opportunity for NII?,quarter,Charles Peabody,Analyst,36,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
What was -- why build the balances so -- so aggressively?,quarter,Charles Peabody,Analyst,36,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
"Yeah, so if you go back to -- we talked about this at the end of last quarter, Charles.",quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,36,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
"At the end of last quarter was an interesting time for the industry, and we felt like it was prudent to just build cash during a period like that.",quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,36,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
"And so, that's what we did. And it was obviously an extraordinary period.",quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,36,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
"Since then, as the environment is normalizing, I'd anticipate, and I talked about that earlier, you'll see our cash levels just continue to come back down.",quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,36,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
"And so, that's all it's happening, was a choice on our part to position with cash, and you'll begin to see that drift lower now.",quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,36,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
"OK. As a follow-up then, would that imply that the average balance sheet or, more importantly, RWAs will start to shrink, and that would help your capital?",quarter,Charles Peabody,Analyst,36,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
I'm just trying to understand the capital.,quarter,Charles Peabody,Analyst,36,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
It shouldn't really impact RWAs because most of that is sort of low or zero RWA.,quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,37,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
"What it should impact is if you look at our net interest yield, that's always a question of numerator and denominator.",quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,37,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
"And when we increased the cash balances, that inflates the denominator for a period of time. So, that doesn't hurt NII, but it does inflate your balance sheet just a little bit.",quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,37,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
"So, I think as you look forward, what you should expect as we just get back to work on both parts of that numerator and denominator will grind away at the NII side.",quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,37,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
"And then, on the denominator side, we'll have a smaller, more efficient balance sheet as the environment normalizes. And in the meantime, it hasn't hurt NII in any way.",quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,37,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
Thank you.,quarter,Charles Peabody,Analyst,37,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
We'll go to Erika Najarian with UBS. Your line is open.,quarter,Operator,Host,37,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
"Hi. Good morning. I'm sorry I missed the earlier call. On the net interest income trajectory, Alistair, clearly, a big focus for your shareholders.",quarter,Erika Najarian,Analyst,37,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
You mentioned when you were responding to Gerard's first question that you narrowed the volatility of net interest income.,quarter,Erika Najarian,Analyst,37,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
"And I think that, you know, investors are -- I'm sure, are going to start asking you guys and us about the starting -- the starting point of 14 billion for NII next year.",quarter,Erika Najarian,Analyst,37,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
"I guess we're wondering, you know, if the Fed stays higher for longer, doesn't move, you know, how does that impact that 14 billion run rate?",quarter,Erika Najarian,Analyst,37,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
"What -- does that 14 billion capture, you know, a cumulative deposit beta that would sort of fully reflect what you would expect to experience through the cycle?",quarter,Erika Najarian,Analyst,37,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
And then I have a follow-up question from there.,quarter,Erika Najarian,Analyst,37,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
"Well, all of our asset disclosures reflect the betas that we believe at the time. So, that part's always in the disclosures.",quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,38,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
It's too early for me to say on 2024. We're giving guidance for the rest of the year.,quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,38,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
"So, you have a pretty good sense of what we're pretty confident around, but last time I looked at the forward curve, we had one, possibly two hikes this year, and then as many as five declines next year.",quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,38,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
"So, there's a lot between here and there. And I think we're just -- just assume to take the next three to six months to figure out, Erika, exactly how we feel about '24.",quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,38,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
Totally understand.,quarter,Erika Najarian,Analyst,38,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
"So, going back to the down 100 -- you know, down 100-basis-point disclosure that would yield to down 3 billion for a full-year basis. How much of that -- you know, given that you have exposure to the shape of the curve, not just the short end of the curve because of your securities book, how much of that is short rates versus long rates in terms of that drop?",quarter,Erika Najarian,Analyst,38,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
"I guess what I'm trying to figure out is if I simply divide -- divide, you know, 3 billion by four, right, that would get me a run rate of, you know, 13.25 billion on a quarterly basis.",quarter,Erika Najarian,Analyst,38,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
"And you mentioned that there are about five cuts in next year. But if it's not on the short end, right, and if it's half-half, then I could get to a run rate of 13.75 billion.",quarter,Erika Najarian,Analyst,38,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
"So, just, you know, I know there's a lot in there, so I would just love your thoughts on everything I just said.",quarter,Erika Najarian,Analyst,38,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
"Well, you lost me a little, but I'll say this, we've got -- it's actually down 3.6 billion. It's not down 3 billion.",quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,38,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
"So that's number one. Number two, you should think about the short end being the vast majority of that.",quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,38,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
"And number three, part of the reason that I think we feel like we've narrowed this quarter and we've got a little more stability around it is A, the securities book; and B, Just as importantly, there's been a large rotation into interest bearing.",quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,39,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
"And so, as rates -- you know, in a disclosure like this, as rates come down, one would expect that we'll be somewhat insulated from that in a different way than we might have two years ago when we didn't have as much interest bearing.",quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,39,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
Understood. Thank you.,quarter,Erika Najarian,Analyst,39,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
We'll take a follow-up from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Your line is open.,quarter,Operator,Host,39,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
"Hey, I just keep staring at Slides 4, 5, and 6 for the digital progress that you're making and trying to connect that to your expenses and operating leverage.",quarter,Mike Mayo,Analyst,39,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
"And I guess where I get to is, certainly, you're -- you're signaling that trend should be good for revenue versus expense or at least you're trying to have that.",quarter,Mike Mayo,Analyst,39,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
"But I still look at the efficiency ratio, expenses for revenues of 64% or 62%, and then you compare that to the levels from 2018 and 2019 when it was 57% and 58%.",quarter,Mike Mayo,Analyst,39,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
"So, I guess the question is, do you guys -- with all these digital initiatives and progress, and again, I appreciate the disclosure on these slides and it'd be great to have more of your peers disclose that with all that progress, why can't you get back to levels from '18 to '19 or at least below 60%? And if so, how long would it take?",quarter,Mike Mayo,Analyst,39,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
"Mike, the linkage of the digital activity to produce the many quarters of operating leverage at the last, you know, 8.5 years, etc., it's an absolute buy-in.",quarter,Brian Moynihan,CEO,39,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
"And Betsy asked about the branch count and all the things that we've done. The efficiency ratio for us is -- has a plain element, which is the wealth management business is a big part of our revenue base and has a different operating dynamic because of how it's reported.",quarter,Brian Moynihan,CEO,40,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
"As you well know, the revenue has a -- the cost of compensation and percent of revenue is high, and we basically make $0.50 on the dollar for every dollar pass the revenue takeout, which the -- the advisor compensation level.",quarter,Brian Moynihan,CEO,40,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
And we're continuing to try to improve that and make the advisor more efficient and things like that.,quarter,Brian Moynihan,CEO,40,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
"But that's a major change. We improved year over year. And, you know, frankly, we're still cleaning out some pandemic-related costs and things like that.",quarter,Brian Moynihan,CEO,40,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
"So, we'll continue to drive that down. And as, you know, net interest income has come up and be more important part of the business, that helps push that efficiency ratio back down.",quarter,Brian Moynihan,CEO,40,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
"And that's the goal. I mean, you're describing what we go to work and do every day.",quarter,Brian Moynihan,CEO,40,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
"And the way we do it is digital, the application of technology across the board, and then removing work from the system and bringing that out and bringing it to the bottom line, and then making the investments we need to make to make it happen again.",quarter,Brian Moynihan,CEO,40,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
"So, we'll continue to do that. But the efficiency ratio, remember, for us, if you go line of business to line of business, is best in class.",quarter,Brian Moynihan,CEO,40,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
It's just we have a bigger mix toward the wealth management business than most other people.,quarter,Brian Moynihan,CEO,40,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
"Let me just try one more time. On the Erica and, you know, it could be Bank of America AI, maybe spin out your Erica business, but you guys highlight the number of hours it saves in manual labor.",quarter,Mike Mayo,Analyst,40,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
And do you have a connection of that to what that says in expenses or what that could save or should save over the next few years?,quarter,Mike Mayo,Analyst,40,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
"Yeah, it'll continue to allow us to do more with the same amount.",quarter,Brian Moynihan,CEO,41,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
"So, if you think about from '19 to now, Mike, remember, the number of customers who do their core checking with us is up 10%, you know.",quarter,Brian Moynihan,CEO,41,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
"So, it's not a -- and that is a lot of people, it's 3 million more customers doing 20 or 30 transactions a month. And all that's going through on a relatively flat expense base.",quarter,Brian Moynihan,CEO,41,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
"And we've been -- you know, we've had -- with inflation and wages and things, we've absorbed all that as part of the thing, and that's -- that's -- that's why the costs have changed.",quarter,Brian Moynihan,CEO,41,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
"But the reality is we flatten that back out, and then we'll keep driving it back down.",quarter,Brian Moynihan,CEO,41,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
"And if you look at the cost of deposits, which is the cost of running all that as a percentage of deposits, you know, you can see that in a consumer page, it's still maintains a nice break against the rate they would receive for their deposit balances. So we're working at it.",quarter,Brian Moynihan,CEO,41,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
"Simply put, about 100,000 people in the consumer business a decade-plus ago. We now have, you know, 60 and going and it comes down a little bit every quarter.",quarter,Brian Moynihan,CEO,41,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
"Even though we're putting, you know, new branches with an average of five to 10 people and then depending on their location and things like that going on.",quarter,Brian Moynihan,CEO,41,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
"And so, that just keeps going in the right direction. Now, if you take that across other things, you know, our operations group, the team there continues to have flat headcount, the down headcount.",quarter,Brian Moynihan,CEO,41,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
"And we invest that back in the technology side for more developers, you know, 20-odd thousand on our payroll plus another 10 or 15 third parties that go through, frankly, the top lines.",quarter,Brian Moynihan,CEO,41,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
"And so, we keep trying to drive it in to make us more efficient. So, all the principle you're saying is right, and we expect it to continue to have a benefit.",quarter,Brian Moynihan,CEO,41,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
All right. Thank you.,quarter,Mike Mayo,Analyst,41,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
"There are no further questions in the queue at this time, I'd like to turn the program back over to Brian Moynihan for any additional or closing remarks.",quarter,Operator,Host,42,Conclusion,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
Thank you and for joining us all.,quarter,Brian Moynihan,CEO,42,Conclusion,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
"As you think about the quarter, strong profitability, strong 15% return on tangible common equity or better, continue to drive organic growth, continue to drive our operating leverage.",quarter,Brian Moynihan,CEO,42,Conclusion,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
And we gave you clarity on the future path of expenses and NII.,quarter,Brian Moynihan,CEO,42,Conclusion,Q2_2023,2023-07-18
