"Information about the non-GAAP financial measures, including reconciliations to U.S. GAAP, can also be found in our earnings materials, and those are available on our website.",quarter,Lee McEntire,Other,2,Disclaimer,Q1_2023,2023-04-18
"So, with that, I will turn it over to Brian. Thank you.",quarter,Lee McEntire,Other,2,Introduction,Q1_2023,2023-04-18
"Good morning, and thank you all of you for joining us. I'm starting on Slide 2 of the materials.",quarter,Brian Moynihan,CEO,2,Prepared remarks,Q1_2023,2023-04-18
"Your company produced one of its highest core EPS, earnings numbers in a challenged operating environment in the first quarter.",quarter,Brian Moynihan,CEO,2,Prepared remarks,Q1_2023,2023-04-18
"Simply put, we navigated that environment well. The preparedness and strength of Bank of America and the trust of our clients reflects a decade-long responsible growth model and relationship nature of our franchise. During quarter one, importantly, organic growth engine continued to perform.",quarter,Brian Moynihan,CEO,2,Prepared remarks,Q1_2023,2023-04-18
"Let me first summarize some points, and I'll turn it over to Alastair to take you through the details of the quarter.",quarter,Brian Moynihan,CEO,2,Prepared remarks,Q1_2023,2023-04-18
"If you go to Slide 2 of the materials, Bank of America delivered strong earnings, growing EPS 18% over first quarter '22.",quarter,Brian Moynihan,CEO,2,Prepared remarks,Q1_2023,2023-04-18
Every business segment performed well.,quarter,Brian Moynihan,CEO,2,Prepared remarks,Q1_2023,2023-04-18
We grew clients and accounts organically and at a strong pace.,quarter,Brian Moynihan,CEO,2,Prepared remarks,Q1_2023,2023-04-18
"We delivered our seventh straight quarter of operating leverage, led by a 13% year-over-year revenue growth.",quarter,Brian Moynihan,CEO,2,Prepared remarks,Q1_2023,2023-04-18
"We further strengthened our balance sheet, with our CET1 ratio increasing to 11.4%.",quarter,Brian Moynihan,CEO,2,Prepared remarks,Q1_2023,2023-04-18
Regulatory capital ended at the highest nominal level in our history at $184 billion.,quarter,Brian Moynihan,CEO,2,Prepared remarks,Q1_2023,2023-04-18
We maintained strong liquidity.,quarter,Brian Moynihan,CEO,2,Prepared remarks,Q1_2023,2023-04-18
We ended the quarter with more than $900 billion in Global Liquidity Sources.,quarter,Brian Moynihan,CEO,3,Prepared remarks,Q1_2023,2023-04-18
"We are in good returns for you as our shareholders, with a return on tangible common equity of 17%, a 107 basis points return on average assets.",quarter,Brian Moynihan,CEO,3,Prepared remarks,Q1_2023,2023-04-18
Tangible book value per share grew 9% year-over-year.,quarter,Brian Moynihan,CEO,3,Prepared remarks,Q1_2023,2023-04-18
"We did this as the economy slowed. And, remember, our research team continues to predict a shallow recession that will occur beginning in the quarter three of 2023.",quarter,Brian Moynihan,CEO,3,Prepared remarks,Q1_2023,2023-04-18
"It's interesting, when we look at our consumer behavior, payments by consumer continued to drive the U.S. economy.",quarter,Brian Moynihan,CEO,3,Prepared remarks,Q1_2023,2023-04-18
"We've seen debit and credit card spending at about 6% year-over-year growth pace, a little slower but still healthy.",quarter,Brian Moynihan,CEO,3,Prepared remarks,Q1_2023,2023-04-18
"But, remember, card spending represents less than a quarter of how consumers pay for things out of their accounts at Bank of America.",quarter,Brian Moynihan,CEO,3,Prepared remarks,Q1_2023,2023-04-18
Overall payments from our customers' accounts across all sources were up 9% year-over-year for March as a month.,quarter,Brian Moynihan,CEO,3,Prepared remarks,Q1_2023,2023-04-18
"Year-to-date, they were up about 8% for the quarter. After slowing in the back half of 2022 a bit, we saw the payments -- pace of payments picked back up in quarter one, especially in the latter parts of the quarter.",quarter,Brian Moynihan,CEO,3,Prepared remarks,Q1_2023,2023-04-18
"Consumers' financial positions remains generally healthy. They're employed with generally higher wages, continue to have strong account balances, and have good access to credit.",quarter,Brian Moynihan,CEO,3,Prepared remarks,Q1_2023,2023-04-18
"As you think through all the tightening actions of the Fed, the flows to alternative yielding assets, investments and the disruption the past quarter, our deposits continued to perform well, ending the quarter at $1.91 trillion.",quarter,Brian Moynihan,CEO,3,Prepared remarks,Q1_2023,2023-04-18
"If you think about it, that's about the same balance that we had in mid-October of 2022. So, we've seen these balances stabilize and remain 34% above they were in prior to the pandemic.",quarter,Brian Moynihan,CEO,3,Prepared remarks,Q1_2023,2023-04-18
"The team has managed well during these periods by remaining focused on the things we can control to drive value through our franchise. I thank them for a very strong quarter, near-record earnings with strong returns.",quarter,Brian Moynihan,CEO,3,Prepared remarks,Q1_2023,2023-04-18
Let me turn the call over to Alastair to walk through the details of the quarter.,quarter,Brian Moynihan,CEO,3,Prepared remarks,Q1_2023,2023-04-18
"Thank you, Brian. And I'll pick up on Slide 3, where we list some of the more detailed highlights of the quarter. And then, on Slide 4, we present the summary income statement. So, I'm going to refer to both of these together.",quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,3,Prepared remarks,Q1_2023,2023-04-18
"As Brian mentioned, for the quarter, we generated $8.2 billion of net income, and that resulted in $0.94 per diluted share.",quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,4,Prepared remarks,Q1_2023,2023-04-18
"Our revenue grew 13%, and that was led by a 25% improvement in net interest income, coupled with strong 9% growth in sales and trading results, excluding DVA.",quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,4,Prepared remarks,Q1_2023,2023-04-18
"Our non-interest revenue was strong, despite three headwinds: First, we had lower service charges as commercial clients paid lower fees for treasury services, since they now receive higher earned rates on balances. And, obviously, that allows us to invest those funds to earn NII.",quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,4,Prepared remarks,Q1_2023,2023-04-18
"On consumer, we had lower NSF insufficient funds and overdraft fees as a result of our policy changes announced in late 2021.",quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,4,Prepared remarks,Q1_2023,2023-04-18
"Second, with lower asset management fees and that just reflects the lower equity market levels and fixed-income market levels.",quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,4,Prepared remarks,Q1_2023,2023-04-18
"And, third, investment banking fees were lower, just reflecting the continuation of sluggish industry activity and reduced fee pools.",quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,4,Prepared remarks,Q1_2023,2023-04-18
"Now, all that said, despite these headwinds, each of the three categories saw modest improvement from the fourth quarter levels.",quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,4,Prepared remarks,Q1_2023,2023-04-18
"Asset quality remained strong, and provision expense for the quarter was $931 million. That consisted of $807 million of net charge-offs and $124 million of reserve build.",quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,4,Prepared remarks,Q1_2023,2023-04-18
And that reserve build compares to a reserve release in the first quarter 2022 of $362 million.,quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,4,Prepared remarks,Q1_2023,2023-04-18
"Our charge-off rate was 32 basis points and still well below the fourth quarter of '19 when our pre-pandemic rate was 39 basis points. And, remember, 2019 was a multi-decade low. So, credit, obviously, remains quite strong.",quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,4,Prepared remarks,Q1_2023,2023-04-18
I want to make one other point on Slide 4 and that is simply to note that pre-tax pre-provision income grew 27% year-over-year compared to reported net income growth of 15%.,quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,4,Prepared remarks,Q1_2023,2023-04-18
"So, let's turn to the balance sheet that starts on Slide 5. And you can see, during the quarter, our balance sheet increased $144 billion to $3.195 trillion.",quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,4,Prepared remarks,Q1_2023,2023-04-18
"Brian noted our liquidity levels at the end of the period, those rose to more than $900 billion from December 31. That's $23 billion higher and it remains $324 billion above our pre-pandemic level in the fourth quarter of '19.",quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,4,Prepared remarks,Q1_2023,2023-04-18
"Shareholders' equity increased $7 billion from the fourth quarter as earnings were only partially offset by capital distributed to shareholders, and we saw an improvement in AOCI of $3 billion due to lower long-term interest rates.",quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,4,Prepared remarks,Q1_2023,2023-04-18
The AOCI included more than $0.5 billion increase from improved valuations of AFS debt securities and that flows through CET1. And the remaining $2.5 billion due to changes in cash flow hedges doesn't impact regulatory capital.,quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,5,Prepared remarks,Q1_2023,2023-04-18
"During the quarter, we paid $1.8 billion in common dividends and we bought back $2.2 billion in shares.",quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,5,Prepared remarks,Q1_2023,2023-04-18
"Turning to regulatory capital, our CET1 level improved to $184 billion since December 31 and our CET1 ratio improved 14 basis points to 11.4%, once again, adding to our buffer over our 10.4% current minimum requirement as well as the 10.9% minimum requirement that we'll see on January 1st of 2024.",quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,5,Prepared remarks,Q1_2023,2023-04-18
"That means, in the past 12 months, we've improved our CET1 ratio by 100 basis points, and we've supported our clients and we've returned $12 billion in capital to shareholders.",quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,5,Prepared remarks,Q1_2023,2023-04-18
"CET1 capital improved $4 billion, and that reflects the benefit of earnings and the AOCI improvement, partially offset by the capital we've returned to shareholders.",quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,5,Prepared remarks,Q1_2023,2023-04-18
Our risk-weighted assets increased modestly and that partially offset the benefit to the CET1 ratio of the higher capital we generated.,quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,5,Prepared remarks,Q1_2023,2023-04-18
"And then, our supplemental leverage ratio increased to 6%. That compares to a minimum requirement of 5% and leaves plenty of capacity for balance sheet growth, and our TLAC ratio remains comfortably above our requirements.",quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,5,Prepared remarks,Q1_2023,2023-04-18
"So, let's spend a minute on loan growth, and we'll do that by turning to Slide 6, where you can see the average loans grew 7% year-over-year, driven by commercial loans and credit card growth.",quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,5,Prepared remarks,Q1_2023,2023-04-18
"The credit card growth reflects increased marketing, it reflects enhanced offers and higher levels of card account openings.",quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,5,Prepared remarks,Q1_2023,2023-04-18
"The commercial growth across the past year reflects the diversity of commercial activity across global banking and global markets and, to some degree, global wealth.",quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,5,Prepared remarks,Q1_2023,2023-04-18
"And on a more near-term linked-quarter basis, loans grew at a much slower pace, partly driven by seasonal credit card paydowns after the fourth quarter holiday spending, and then commercial demand slowed in Q1 and we saw some paydowns by our wealth management clients as they lowered leverage as rates rose.",quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,5,Prepared remarks,Q1_2023,2023-04-18
"So, let's turn to deposits and there's obviously been a lot of additional focus this quarter, so I want to spend extra time here and I'm going to start with Slide 7 and talk about average deposits.",quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,5,Prepared remarks,Q1_2023,2023-04-18
Just a few points we need to make before focusing on a more detailed discussion of the recent trends.,quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,6,Prepared remarks,Q1_2023,2023-04-18
"Average total deposits for the first quarter were $1.89 trillion, that is down 2% linked-quarter and down 7% year-over-year.",quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,6,Prepared remarks,Q1_2023,2023-04-18
"Our deposits peaked in the fourth quarter of 2021. And even as the Fed has continued to withdraw money supply, our deposits have held around $1.9 trillion, because there's a lot more industry deposits today in a much bigger economy today compared to pre-pandemic.",quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,6,Prepared remarks,Q1_2023,2023-04-18
"Our average deposits were up 34% compared to our pre-pandemic Q4 '19 balance and the industry's deposits were up 31% to $17.4 trillion. So, we've obviously fared a little bit better than the industry.",quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,6,Prepared remarks,Q1_2023,2023-04-18
"We put our pre-pandemic deposits for each line of business on the slide, so you can compare our balances then and now.",quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,6,Prepared remarks,Q1_2023,2023-04-18
"I want to highlight consumer checking balances, which remained 53% higher than pre-pandemic.",quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,6,Prepared remarks,Q1_2023,2023-04-18
"And as I think all of us would expect, GWIM combined client deposits are up a lesser 23%, as those are the clients that generally move their excess cash into other off-balance sheet products.",quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,6,Prepared remarks,Q1_2023,2023-04-18
"And in global banking, you can see the rotation to interest-bearing across time as rates rose.",quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,6,Prepared remarks,Q1_2023,2023-04-18
"So, let's get a little more granular and a little more near-term and we'll use Slide 8 for that, where you can see the breakout of deposit trends on a weekly ending basis across the last two quarters.",quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,6,Prepared remarks,Q1_2023,2023-04-18
"You can also see that we plotted the timeline of Fed target and rate hikes on the top-left chart, just for comparison through time.",quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,6,Prepared remarks,Q1_2023,2023-04-18
"In the upper left, you can see the trend of our total deposits. We ended Q1 '23 at $1.91 trillion, that's down 1%. And, as Brian mentioned, over the course of the past six months, those balances have been relatively stable.",quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,6,Prepared remarks,Q1_2023,2023-04-18
"In consumer, looking at the top-right chart, we show the difference here in the movement through the quarter between the balances of low to no interest checking accounts, and the higher-yielding non-checking accounts and, across the entire quarter, we saw a modest $4 billion decline in total.",quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,6,Prepared remarks,Q1_2023,2023-04-18
"Checking balances, obviously, have some variability around pay days in particular, but note the relative stability of checking deposits, because these are the operational accounts with money and motion to pay the bills and everyday living costs for families.",quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,6,Prepared remarks,Q1_2023,2023-04-18
I'd also point out that our checking balances were modestly growing even ahead of March 9th upheaval and continue to move higher through the quarter on the back of disruption.,quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,6,Prepared remarks,Q1_2023,2023-04-18
Lower non-checking balances mostly reflect money moved out of deposits and into brokerage accounts where we earn a small fee.,quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,7,Prepared remarks,Q1_2023,2023-04-18
"Rate paid increased 6 basis points from the fourth quarter to 12 basis points on this [trillion dollars] (ph) of total consumer deposits and remains low, because of the 52% mix that is checking.",quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,7,Prepared remarks,Q1_2023,2023-04-18
"Lastly, I just note that the rate movements in this business are concentrated in the small CDs and consumer investment deposits, which together represent about 5% of the deposits.",quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,7,Prepared remarks,Q1_2023,2023-04-18
"In wealth management, as you would expect, it shows the most relative decline, and you can see the continued trend of clients moving money from lower-yielding sweep accounts into higher-yielding preferred deposits and off-balance sheet to other investment alternatives.",quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,7,Prepared remarks,Q1_2023,2023-04-18
"Now, if we went back further, you'd see that roughly $90 billion has moved out of sweeps in the past year, which leaves $80 billion in these accounts.",quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,7,Prepared remarks,Q1_2023,2023-04-18
"So, you can see how with the pace and size of rate hikes slowing, we expect the declines in balances to lessen from here.",quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,7,Prepared remarks,Q1_2023,2023-04-18
"At the bottom-right, note the global banking deposit movement, where we hold about $500 billion in customer deposits.",quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,7,Prepared remarks,Q1_2023,2023-04-18
These are generally operational deposits of our commercial customers and they use that to manage their cash flows through the course of the year. Those were down $3 billion from the fourth quarter.,quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,7,Prepared remarks,Q1_2023,2023-04-18
"And what's interesting to note is that, our total deposits in this segment have been stable at around $500 billion for the past six months and this business just continues to see rotation into interest-bearing.",quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,7,Prepared remarks,Q1_2023,2023-04-18
"The mix of interest-bearing deposits on an ending basis moved from 49% last quarter to 55% in Q1. And, obviously, we pay increased rates on those interest-bearing deposits.",quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,7,Prepared remarks,Q1_2023,2023-04-18
"And it's this rotation in global banking that's driving the rotational shift of the total company, and it's pretty typical and to be expected in this environment.",quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,7,Prepared remarks,Q1_2023,2023-04-18
"So, in summary, our deposits continued to behave as we would expect.",quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,7,Prepared remarks,Q1_2023,2023-04-18
"The cash transactional balances have shown some recent stabilization. And for investment cash, we've seen deposits moved to brokerage and other platforms for direct holdings of money market, mutual funds, treasuries, and we are capturing many of those flows as you see in our numbers, it's just we expect that to slow going forward.",quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,7,Prepared remarks,Q1_2023,2023-04-18
"So, now that we've examined trends for the different lines of business, I want to make some important points about the characteristics of our deposit franchise using Slide 9, and this will just help reinforce for shareholders who own Bank of America that they're investing in one of the world's great deposit franchises, all of it based off of relationships we have with our customers and the value they place on the award-winning capabilities and convenience they have access to.",quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,8,Prepared remarks,Q1_2023,2023-04-18
"So, starting from the top, focus first on consumer.",quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,8,Prepared remarks,Q1_2023,2023-04-18
"You can see that more than 80% of deposits have been with us for more than five years, and more than two-thirds of our consumer deposits are balances with customers who have had relationships with the bank for more than 10 years.",quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,8,Prepared remarks,Q1_2023,2023-04-18
"Also, more than three-quarters of these customers are very highly engaged in their activities with us. They are also, geographically, dispersed across the United States given our presence in 83 of the top 100 markets.",quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,8,Prepared remarks,Q1_2023,2023-04-18
"Lastly, whether you look at consumers or small business, the value proposition is what's driving the same result. We've got long-tenured customers with deep relationships that are highly engaged.",quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,8,Prepared remarks,Q1_2023,2023-04-18
"Turning to wealth management, you can see a similar story around long tenure and quite active relationships.",quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,8,Prepared remarks,Q1_2023,2023-04-18
"The average relationship of our GWIM clients is around 14 years. And, again, these clients are very geographically diverse, they're also very digitally engaged, and we continue to see deepening around banking solutions and products of all types.",quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,8,Prepared remarks,Q1_2023,2023-04-18
"There's lots of options for these clients that extend from their operational checking accounts all the way up through preferred deposit options, and then we also benefit from having great alternatives for them within our investment platform.",quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,8,Prepared remarks,Q1_2023,2023-04-18
"On global banking, note that 80% of our U.S. deposit balances are held by clients who have had an account with us for at least 10 years.",quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,8,Prepared remarks,Q1_2023,2023-04-18
"Furthermore, as we measure the number of solutions that clients have with us, we know that 73% of balances are held by clients that have at least five products on us and, just like the other businesses, they are highly diversified by industry and geography.",quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,8,Prepared remarks,Q1_2023,2023-04-18
"So, those are some of the things that make our quality deposit base stable.",quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,8,Prepared remarks,Q1_2023,2023-04-18
"So, now that we've walked through both loans and deposits, I want to transition a bit to make some points on balance sheet management and to focus on the liquidity we enjoy by having a surplus of customer deposits that far exceeds the loan demand of our clients today and far exceeded the loan demand of our clients pre-pandemic.",quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,8,Prepared remarks,Q1_2023,2023-04-18
"Having the deposits alone doesn't pay the expenses to support these great customer bases and it doesn't mean much to our shareholders, unless we put them to work to extract the value of those deposits. So, that's what we're trying to illustrate and we want to show you how we do them.",quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,9,Prepared remarks,Q1_2023,2023-04-18
"You can see that on Slide 10, where you note we had significant excess deposits over loans pre-pandemic.",quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,9,Prepared remarks,Q1_2023,2023-04-18
"And during the pandemic, that increased -- that amount increased significantly. Before the pandemic, we had $0.5 trillion more in deposits than loans and that peaked in late 2021 at more than $1.1 trillion and it remains high at roughly $900 billion still today. That's the context as we talk about how we manage excess cash.",quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,9,Prepared remarks,Q1_2023,2023-04-18
"So, let's turn to Slide 11. And here we're going to focus on the banking book, because our global markets' balance sheet has remained largely market funded. And just follow the graph from left to right.",quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,9,Prepared remarks,Q1_2023,2023-04-18
"At the top of the slide, you note trend of cash and cash equivalents and the two components of the debt securities balances: available-for-sale and held-to-maturity. And you can see the trend of the overall combined cash and securities balance movement and it closely mirrors the previous slide's excess deposit trends, as you would expect.",quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,9,Prepared remarks,Q1_2023,2023-04-18
"In 2020, deposits grew, while loans declined and that was pandemic borrowing from our commercial clients stopping and then quickly paying it off.",quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,9,Prepared remarks,Q1_2023,2023-04-18
"Throughout 2020, as we put deposits to work, we took a number of actions to protect our capital and that included a buildup in hold-to-maturity, better aligning our capital treatment with our intent to hold those securities to maturity.",quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,9,Prepared remarks,Q1_2023,2023-04-18
"We also hedged rate risk in the available-for-sale book using pay-fixed, receive-variable swaps. So, these securities acted like cash and they earned higher yields and guarded against capital volatility.",quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,9,Prepared remarks,Q1_2023,2023-04-18
"As we entered the middle of 2021, it became more clearer that the stimulus payment would likely be the last one and, therefore, we believed deposits would be peaking.",quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,9,Prepared remarks,Q1_2023,2023-04-18
"As a result, we stopped adding to our hold-to-maturity securities book. That book peaked in the third quarter of 2021 at $683 billion, $562 billion were mortgage backs, and the rest were treasuries.",quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,9,Prepared remarks,Q1_2023,2023-04-18
"And all that's happened is that notional balances have declined in each of the past six quarters, ending the quarter at $625 billion. And within that, the mortgage-backed portfolio was down $67 billion to $495 billion.",quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,10,Prepared remarks,Q1_2023,2023-04-18
"As rates began to rise quickly throughout 2022, the value of our deposits rose. And, at the same time, the disclosed market value of the hold-to-maturity securities has declined, resulting in a negative market valuation on those bonds.",quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,10,Prepared remarks,Q1_2023,2023-04-18
"That negative market valuation peaked in the third quarter, came down in the fourth quarter, and it's come down another $10 billion in the first quarter.",quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,10,Prepared remarks,Q1_2023,2023-04-18
"In our 10-K disclosure, we included a chart which shows the maturity distribution of our securities portfolio. And, I'd remind you, this is based on the maturity dates of those originations, i.e., the date of the last contractual payment.",quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,10,Prepared remarks,Q1_2023,2023-04-18
"When we look at the actual cash flows of those bonds over time, it results in an average weighted life of the hold-to-maturity securities book of a little more than eight years.",quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,10,Prepared remarks,Q1_2023,2023-04-18
"And as you can see, since the third quarter of 2021, we've continued to see increases in the overall yield on the balances due to both the maturity and reinvestment of lower-yielding securities as well as remix into higher-yielding cash.",quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,10,Prepared remarks,Q1_2023,2023-04-18
"And, as you can see, with deposits paying 92 basis points, that compares to our blend of cash and government-guaranteed securities, which pays 290 basis points. So, we continue to benefit NII and yield.",quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,10,Prepared remarks,Q1_2023,2023-04-18
"And, finally, one very important last point I want to make, which is on the improved NII of our banking book. Because, remember, we manage the entirety of our balance sheet.",quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,10,Prepared remarks,Q1_2023,2023-04-18
That includes our deposits and that's where you see the net interest income has improved significantly.,quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,10,Prepared remarks,Q1_2023,2023-04-18
"NII, excluding global markets, which we disclose each quarter, troughed in the third quarter of 2020 at $9.1 billion, and it's now $5.4 billion higher on a quarterly basis at $14.5 billion in the first quarter of '23, and that's the acid test of managing the entire balance sheet.",quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,10,Prepared remarks,Q1_2023,2023-04-18
"So, let's turn now to Slide 12 and focus on net interest income. On a GAAP non-FTE basis, NII in the first quarter was $14.4 billion and the FTE NII number was $14.6 billion.",quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,10,Prepared remarks,Q1_2023,2023-04-18
"Focusing on FTE, net interest income increased $2.9 billion from the first quarter of 2022 or 25%, while our net interest yield improved 51 basis points to 2.2%. The improvement was driven by rates, and that includes reductions in securities premium amortization.",quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,10,Prepared remarks,Q1_2023,2023-04-18
"Average Fed fund rates are up 440 basis points year-over-year. Relative to that increase in Fed funds, which has benefited all of our variable rate assets, the rate paid on our total deposits rose 89 basis points and the rate paid today on interest-bearing deposits is up 133 basis points.",quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,11,Prepared remarks,Q1_2023,2023-04-18
Average loan growth of $64 billion also aided the year-over-year NII improvement.,quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,11,Prepared remarks,Q1_2023,2023-04-18
"Turning to a linked-quarter discussion, NII of $14.6 billion is down $222 million from Q4, and that's primarily driven by the continued impact of lower deposit balances and the mix shift into interest-bearing.",quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,11,Prepared remarks,Q1_2023,2023-04-18
"It's also influenced by lower global markets NII, which, remember, still gets passed through to clients via higher non-interest income as part of the trading revenue.",quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,11,Prepared remarks,Q1_2023,2023-04-18
"Excluding the $262 million decline in global markets' NII, the banking book NII of $14.5 billion, that was modestly higher as the benefit of increased short interest rates, some modest loan growth and some deposit favorability was offset by two less days of interest in the quarter.",quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,11,Prepared remarks,Q1_2023,2023-04-18
"Turning to asset sensitivity on a forward basis, the plus 100 basis point parallel shift at March 31st stands at $3.3 billion of expected NII over the next 12 months from our banking book.",quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,11,Prepared remarks,Q1_2023,2023-04-18
96% of that sensitivity is driven by short rates.,quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,11,Prepared remarks,Q1_2023,2023-04-18
"Summary, the first quarter NII was $14.6 billion in this quarter on an FTE basis and that was a little better than our $14.4 billion expectation as we began the quarter since deposits and rate pass-throughs were both modestly better.",quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,11,Prepared remarks,Q1_2023,2023-04-18
"Looking forward, based on everything we know about interest rates and customer behavior, we expect second quarter NII on an FTE basis to be around 2% lower compared to Q1.",quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,11,Prepared remarks,Q1_2023,2023-04-18
"So, think about that NII as about $14.3 billion FTE, plus or minus, driven by expected deposit movements as well as lower global markets' NII, which again is offset in the trading revenue.",quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,11,Prepared remarks,Q1_2023,2023-04-18
"So, let me remind you of some of the caveats when it comes to that NII guidance.",quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,11,Prepared remarks,Q1_2023,2023-04-18
"First, importantly, it assumes that interest rates in the forward curve materialize and that includes one more hike and then a couple of cuts in 2023.",quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,11,Prepared remarks,Q1_2023,2023-04-18
"We also expect funding costs for global markets client activity to continue to increase based on those high rates. And, as noted, the impact of that is still offset in non-interest income, and that obviously assumes our current client positioning and the forward rate expectations.",quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,11,Prepared remarks,Q1_2023,2023-04-18
"We continue to expect modest loan growth. So, that's in our NII expectation as well, and it's driven by credit card and, to a lesser degree, commercial.",quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,11,Prepared remarks,Q1_2023,2023-04-18
"And then, finally, we just expect lower deposits and rotational shifts towards interest-bearing, really for three reasons.",quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,12,Prepared remarks,Q1_2023,2023-04-18
"First, we expect further Fed balance sheet reductions to continue to reduce deposits for the industry.",quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,12,Prepared remarks,Q1_2023,2023-04-18
"Second, we anticipate lower wealth management deposits in the second quarter. That's pretty typical due to the seasonal impact of clients paying income taxes and, to a lesser degree now, a continuation of balance movement seeking better yields off-balance sheet.",quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,12,Prepared remarks,Q1_2023,2023-04-18
"And, third, we just continue to expect some of the rotation of commercial deposits towards interest-bearing.",quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,12,Prepared remarks,Q1_2023,2023-04-18
"Okay. Let's go to Slide 13, we'll talk about expense. And here what you can see is, in the first quarter, our expenses were $16.2 billion, that's up $700 million from the fourth quarter and it's driven by seasonal elevation from payroll taxes, mostly at $450 million, a little bit from higher FDIC insurance expense, that was another $100 million this quarter, and the cost of adding people, call that another $100 million.",quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,12,Prepared remarks,Q1_2023,2023-04-18
"We ended the first quarter with a little more than 217,000 people at the company, that was 260 people more than year-end. During the quarter, we welcomed 3,000 additional people into the company in January, that's due to outstanding offers that we extended in the fourth quarter.",quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,12,Prepared remarks,Q1_2023,2023-04-18
"That meant that our headcount peaked in January. That's a little more than 218,000. And, at the end of last week, we were down to 216,000.",quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,12,Prepared remarks,Q1_2023,2023-04-18
"We continue to expect that to move lower over time and we expect, by the end of the second quarter, our full-time equivalent headcount will be roughly 213,000, excluding our summer interns.",quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,12,Prepared remarks,Q1_2023,2023-04-18
"As we look forward to the next quarter then, we would expect Q2 expense to benefit from the reduction of the seasonal elevation of payroll tax in Q1, and we would also expect to see expense reductions coming from headcount reductions through attrition over time and our operational excellence work.",quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,12,Prepared remarks,Q1_2023,2023-04-18
"So, we expect expense in Q2 to be around $400 million or $500 million lower than Q1, so think of that as around $15.8 billion, plus or minus, in Q2.",quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,12,Prepared remarks,Q1_2023,2023-04-18
"And then further, we just expect continued sequential expense declines in the third quarter and then again in the fourth quarter as we benefit from continued headcount discipline and attrition through time.",quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,12,Prepared remarks,Q1_2023,2023-04-18
"Now turn to asset quality on Slide 14, and I want to start the credit discussion by saying, once again, asset quality of our customers remains healthy and net charge-offs continue to rise from their near historic lows.",quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,12,Prepared remarks,Q1_2023,2023-04-18
Net charge-offs of $807 million increased $118 million from the fourth quarter. That increase was driven by credit card losses as higher late-stage delinquencies flowed through to charge-offs.,quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,13,Prepared remarks,Q1_2023,2023-04-18
"For context, the credit card net charge-off rate was 2.21% in this first quarter and that compares to 3.03% in the fourth quarter of '19 pre-pandemic.",quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,13,Prepared remarks,Q1_2023,2023-04-18
"Provision expense was $931 million in Q1, and that included a $124 million reserve build.",quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,13,Prepared remarks,Q1_2023,2023-04-18
"That's obviously less than the $403 million build we took in the fourth quarter, and it reflects modest loan growth and an ever so slightly improved macroeconomic outlook that, on a weighted basis, continues to include an unemployment rate still north of 5% as we end 2023.",quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,13,Prepared remarks,Q1_2023,2023-04-18
We included a slide in the appendix this quarter that highlights the mix and credit metrics of our commercial real estate exposure.,quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,13,Prepared remarks,Q1_2023,2023-04-18
"And I just wanted to remind everyone here, we've been very intentional around our client selection, very intentional around portfolio concentration, and deal structure over many years and, as a result, we've seen NPLs and realized losses that remain quite low for this portfolio.",quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,13,Prepared remarks,Q1_2023,2023-04-18
We had a total of $66 million of commercial real estate losses in 2022.,quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,13,Prepared remarks,Q1_2023,2023-04-18
70% of that was in office loans and that resulted in an annualized loss rate of 26 basis points.,quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,13,Prepared remarks,Q1_2023,2023-04-18
"In the first quarter, to give some perspective, our office loan losses were $15 million.",quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,13,Prepared remarks,Q1_2023,2023-04-18
"We have roughly $73 billion in commercial real estate loans outstanding, that's less than 7% of our loan book. It's highly diversified by geography, and no part of the country represents more than 22% of the book.",quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,13,Prepared remarks,Q1_2023,2023-04-18
It's also very diversified across property type.,quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,13,Prepared remarks,Q1_2023,2023-04-18
"Within property type, our office portfolio was $19 billion, it's about 2% of our total loans. The portfolio is roughly 75% Class A properties.",quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,13,Prepared remarks,Q1_2023,2023-04-18
"And when we originate, they are typically around 55% loan-to-value. Even though we've seen some property value declines, this exposure still remain well secured.",quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,13,Prepared remarks,Q1_2023,2023-04-18
"$3.6 billion is classified as reservable criticized. And even on the most recent refreshes on our toughest loans, we still have 75% LTVs.",quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,13,Prepared remarks,Q1_2023,2023-04-18
"In our office book, $4 billion is scheduled to mature this year, another $6 billion in 2024, with the remainder spread over the following years. So, we continue to feel that the portfolio is well-positioned and adequately reserved given the current conditions.",quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,13,Prepared remarks,Q1_2023,2023-04-18

"Finally, on [Slide 5] (ph), you can see the all other shows a modest loss, which includes the $220 million losses in securities sold, as Alastair mentioned earlier.",quarter,Brian Moynihan,CEO,17,Prepared remarks,Q1_2023,2023-04-18
"And last, I would note our 10% effective tax rate this quarter continues to benefit us from a strong business with clients, supporting environmental investments, in-housing investments to produce tax benefits.",quarter,Brian Moynihan,CEO,17,Prepared remarks,Q1_2023,2023-04-18
"Excluding those and the other discrete tax benefits, our tax rate would have been 26%.",quarter,Brian Moynihan,CEO,17,Prepared remarks,Q1_2023,2023-04-18
"So, in summary, a strong quarter by our team delivered for you, our shareholders, operating leverage, organic growth, strong credit, capital return, and strong ROTCE. With that, let's jump to Q&A.",quarter,Brian Moynihan,CEO,17,Prepared remarks,Q1_2023,2023-04-18
We'll take our first question from Jim Mitchell with Seaport Global. Your line is open.,quarter,Operator,Host,18,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-18
"Hey, good morning, guys. Maybe just one question on the NII trajectory. You guys remain asset-sensitive in the banking book, but the forward curve is -- I think you pointed out currently expect three rate cuts by the end of the year. If that plays out, how do you think about that impact on NII in the back half of the year? What are the puts and takes as we think about NII beyond 2Q?",quarter,Jim Mitchell,Analyst,18,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-18
"So, Jim, I think, right now, the expectations for the market in terms of whether or not there'll be another hike in May, that's bouncing around pretty good.",quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,18,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-18
"Similarly, you've got a question of whether or not there's two cuts at the back half or three. So, we're operating with the same information you are. We're looking at the forward curve day-to-day thinking that through.",quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,18,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-18
"At the same time, we're looking at our deposit balances. They're performing kind of the way we would think and we're competing for rate paid. So, I'd say, generally speaking, at this point, we feel pretty good about NII. It's obviously going to be up this year pretty significantly.",quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,18,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-18
"And, look, we don't provide guidance for the full year for a very simple reason, it just comes down to -- it's very difficult to predict what the Fed is going to do six months and nine months out.",quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,18,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-18
"But let me put it this way, we can see where our consensus is. Consensus is right around $57 billion, plus or minus. That's sort of the number that would imply us up for the year, 7% to 8%. I mean, I think, we're pretty comfortable there, but it's just so many moving parts, that's why we don't provide the guidance.",quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,18,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-18
"No, that's all fair. And maybe just pivoting to the trading business, you had another strong quarter and outperformed peers in the fixed income business. Is there anything unusually strong there? Or do you believe you guys have made some sustainable market share gains in that business given your recent investments?",quarter,Jim Mitchell,Analyst,19,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-18
"Well, I think, the team has done a really good job. Brian talked about that. A couple of years ago, we made a decision as a team that it was important for us to invest more in that business and we did that.",quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,19,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-18
"And we've made pretty significant investments in equities and in fixed income. And we felt like, in particular, we could continue to grow our macro businesses, which we've done, and that's what has done a really good job until this quarter.",quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,19,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-18
"This quarter, we just happen to fire on more cylinders, particularly in FICC, because this quarter we had a great quarter for our micro products and you kind of expect that, because it was a better quarter for them.",quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,19,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-18
"We've had positive returns there. So, mortgages, credit, munis, financing, futures, FX, all of them had a pretty good quarter and, I think, Jim and the team are just executing at a really high level. So, they just got to keep at it.",quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,19,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-18
Fair enough. Thanks for taking my questions.,quarter,Jim Mitchell,Analyst,19,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-18
We'll take our next question from Erika Najarian with UBS. Your line is open.,quarter,Operator,Host,19,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-18
"Hi, good morning. Alastair, just a clarification. You gave us the quarterly expected trajectory for expenses. Do you still expect to hit $62.5 billion or so of full year expenses in '23?",quarter,Erika Najarian,Analyst,20,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-18
"Right now, that's our expectation. I mean, we're 90 days into the quarter -- I'd say into the year rather. Obviously, as we're looking forward, we see -- we know the headcount is coming down, so that's going to be a tailwind all the way through the course of the year.",quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,20,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-18
"So, we don't have any change in our expectations right now. We're going to see how the year develops.",quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,20,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-18
"We still got a little bit of a headwind in terms of something like our sales and trading business having a very good revenue year, and we're still investing in the business. So, it'll be a dog fight, particularly as we get into the back half of the year, but we still feel good about where we are with respect to the expense.",quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,20,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-18
"Got it. And my second question is for Brian. Brian, you've produced a significant amount of revenue this quarter and grew your CET1. At the same time, I think that a lot of investors are looking down the path of significant macro uncertainty. As we take that into account, how should we think about the buyback activity going forward, especially ahead of the stress test results in June?",quarter,Erika Najarian,Analyst,20,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-18
"I think, you saw this quarter, we continue to adopt our basic, or apply our basic principles, which is we support the growth in our customer base, we pay the dividends that are -- what we think is the rational rate, and then we use the rest to basically return to use for the share buybacks.",quarter,Brian Moynihan,CEO,20,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-18
"Yeah, we're in the middle of stress test as you just mentioned. We'll have to see the results of that. We also -- but the good news is, we crossed 11.40% this quarter, which basically is an excess -- has a cushion on top of what we need for the first quarter of next year.",quarter,Brian Moynihan,CEO,21,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-18
"And so, we'll continue to follow our basic principles.",quarter,Brian Moynihan,CEO,21,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-18
"So, we're -- we feel good -- very good about our capital and you should expect us to continue to follow the idea to pay the dividend or grow organic -- support the organic growth, pay the dividend and buyback shares, but we've got to get through the near-term sort of what goes on in our business every year at this time.",quarter,Brian Moynihan,CEO,21,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-18
Got it. Thank you.,quarter,Erika Najarian,Analyst,21,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-18
We'll go next to Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Your line is open.,quarter,Operator,Host,21,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-18
"Good morning. Hey, I just wondering on the deposit side, if you can help us understand, there is obviously the ongoing mix shift, which you referred to and gave us a lot of great detail on it. I'm just wondering, as you think forward, how much more mix shift are you expecting in terms of DVAs as a percentage of total deposits? And how do you expect that to also look as you think across the businesses with regards to just where customers are moving funds incrementally? Thank you.",quarter,Ken Usdin,Analyst,21,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-18
"Yeah. I think, Ken, we think this -- everybody thinks this as a big bulk thing, Bank of America, but it's really -- and then looks at broad categories of interest-bearing and non-interest bearing accounts and treasury. You have to really think about customer bases and what they do with their money.",quarter,Brian Moynihan,CEO,21,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-18
"And so, there is transactional cash, whether that's for consumer running their household day-to-day or a wealthy consumer running their household day-to-day, which may have different level of expenses. And then, the commercial customers, who run their business day-to-day and then have excess cash from that if they are successful, and then how they all play that through. So I think -- we think, transactional cash and investment cash.",quarter,Brian Moynihan,CEO,22,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-18
"You've seen a lot of investment cash as -- so to speak. As Alastair mentioned earlier, we price competitively for that, that moves around. But the good news is, we have a massive investment platform where we put that money to work for our customers if they don't need to manage their day-to-day household.",quarter,Brian Moynihan,CEO,22,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-18
"So, in our NII estimates, our view of what happens in the future, I think, the key for the consumer business is to remember that, they've got $700 billion of excess deposits over its loans.",quarter,Brian Moynihan,CEO,22,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-18
"It's generating a lot of excess deposits that grew $300-odd billion from pre-pandemic, it has been stable. The checking balances, if you look at those charts we gave you, they show you the near-term movement are stable.",quarter,Brian Moynihan,CEO,22,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-18
"That generates at a total all-in cost of 10 basis points to 15 basis points, a lot of the value in our franchise, and meaning -- including interest-bearing part of that franchise when you think about deposits across time and in like businesses.",quarter,Brian Moynihan,CEO,22,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-18
"So, you'd expect some of those trends to continue in terms of customers have excess cash, putting it to work differently. Here, we expect the deposit rates to move to continue to match the market. But the broad value of this deposit franchises driven by the money people leave us, because it's transactional cash, which is a motion, and we don't pay interest on, and that is both the consumers, wealthy customers and businesses.",quarter,Brian Moynihan,CEO,22,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-18
"So, it's hard. It's a very detailed question of which we spent a lot of time looking at or the team does, as you might imagine.",quarter,Brian Moynihan,CEO,22,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-18
"Okay. And the other question is just then, Alastair you walked through how you've been changing the composition of the securities portfolio and still benefiting from those variable rate swaps. I'm just wondering if you can help us understand what happens from here in terms of -- or should you continue to get benefits from those variable rate swaps? And then, also just -- do you -- have you done any positioning -- repositioning underneath the surface? It looks like there were some securities losses. So, how much room do you have to continue to kind of rework the portfolio and grind more income out of the book even as you shrink it?",quarter,Ken Usdin,Analyst,22,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-18
"Yeah. So, Ken, think about -- I mean, the easiest way to think about those treasuries, they're swapped to floating, so they're essentially cash.",quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,23,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-18
"And, actually, this quarter, we ended up converting some of them into cash, just because it's simpler, it's simpler for everyone to understand, and this is, obviously, a pretty good bid for treasuries this quarter. So, we just converted them into cash. That's what accounted for some of the securities loss there, it was a couple hundred million.",quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,23,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-18
"But I think the way to think about it is, as the overall securities portfolio -- remember, we've got cash, we've got available-for-sale, you can always think about that as enhanced cash, and we've got hold-to-maturity, as that continues to pay down, we're just sweeping it right now into cash.",quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,23,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-18
"That's something I've talked about in the last couple of quarters. And we're putting in cash, because: number one, it's a really high-yielding asset; number two, it gives us a lot of options during a period of volatility. So, pretty straightforward at this point.",quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,23,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-18
Okay. Got it. Thank you.,quarter,Ken Usdin,Analyst,23,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-18
Our next question comes from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.,quarter,Operator,Host,23,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-18
"Hi. Well, I guess, the topic of the day, week and the month is, to what degree are your assets matched with your liabilities? And I'm staring at Slide 11, and you've seen the front page of many papers, highlighting your unrealized securities losses. You highlight the yield on your securities at 2.6%. You highlighted your held-to-maturity portfolio at eight years, that would all suggest to some that you're not so well matched.",quarter,Mike Mayo,Analyst,23,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-18
"On the other hand, what you don't provide or at least I didn't see it, the change in the value of your deposits or even the duration of your deposit. So, the basic question is, can you describe to what degree your assets are matched with your liabilities? And where you think you may have been off or on the mark?",quarter,Mike Mayo,Analyst,24,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-18
"Yeah. So, Mike, I'll start. Brian can add anything he chooses to. But one of the reasons that we spend as much time laying out the deposit franchise is because in a rising rate environment, you'd expect obviously that bond markets are going to turn negative. And, at the same time, you and we have been expecting, as rates go up, the NII would rise, because the deposits are so much more valuable in that environment.",quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,24,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-18
"What we laid out for you and for everyone to see is just how broad and stable and diversified is this deposit base. We think it's very long-tenured. That's why we're laying out some of these things around just how long the relationships are in consumer and in wealth and in global banking, and it's one of the reasons why…",quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,24,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-18
"Alastair -- hey, Alastair, if I can just interrupt, just when you say long-tenured, can you put any numbers around that range? Because I think that's the one biggest most important number. If you could just -- some kind of frame that a little bit?",quarter,Mike Mayo,Analyst,24,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-18
"Yeah. If you took a look at Slide number 9, we've tried to lay that out for you. So, you take a look at -- in consumer, for example, you're talking about 67% of the clients have been with us for more than 10 years. That's pretty long-tenured. I know from my time in the commercial bank, our clients on average were 17 years with us.",quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,25,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-18
"You have long operational deposits in all of these businesses. So, that's what we're trying to lay out in front of everyone, so you can see that.",quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,25,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-18
"Okay. I'm sorry, I interrupted, but go ahead.",quarter,Mike Mayo,Analyst,25,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-18
"Now, I can't remember where it was.",quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,25,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-18
"You were talking about the unrealized securities loss, the NII went higher, that's part of the benefits of having...",quarter,Mike Mayo,Analyst,25,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-18
"No. I think, look, what I'm trying to convey to you too, Mike, and you know how this works, we've got to balance all of this, because we have to think about the entire balance sheet. And there's a lot going on with the entire balance sheet.",quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,25,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-18
"And so, what we're trying to do is invest that excess, which has existed now in hundreds of billions for many, many years.",quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,25,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-18
"We've got to invest it the best way we can. And the way we do that, we talk about balancing it, it's we're -- number one, trying to make sure we grow capital. We've done that. We're up 100 basis points there in the last year. Number two, we're trying to grow liquidity. We added $23 billion in this past quarter. Number three, we're trying to grow earnings. We're at $8.2 billion, it's one of our best earnings quarters ever.",quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,25,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-18
"So, look, we can always be better. You know that we're taking the portfolio and we're just making it smaller, it's run off now six quarters in a row.",quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,26,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-18
"We're taking all of that and flowing it into cash and loans. That's what we've been doing. We'll just continue doing that, and the portfolio is going to get smaller and shorter overtime.",quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,26,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-18
"And when you look at the asset sensitivity now, relative to rates going up 100 or rates going down 100, we're pretty balanced there too. We're sort of up $3.3 billion if rates go up 100. We're down $3.6 billion, if rates go down 100, so we feel like we're in a pretty balanced place and lot of flexibility at this point.",quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,26,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-18
"And then just a follow-up. I guess, some will take your greatest strength as a weakness, that is you don't pay as much on deposits as others. I estimate that you have the lowest cycle-to-date deposit beta. And so, what is it that keeps your customers around if you're not going to pay them as much?",quarter,Mike Mayo,Analyst,26,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-18
"Well, I think, if you look at the value proposition that we're talking about, if you go to the consumer business, for example, we've invested so much in client experience, whether it's the financial centers, renovation, whether it's the new -- the people that we've added in that business over a long period of time, whether it's the digital, the mobile, preferred rewards, ours is a relationship model and it has been.",quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,26,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-18
"And if you look then -- like, just think about this quarter, look at the organic growth in consumer again, that's a 130,000 net new checking, 17 quarters in a row. Based on that relationship value proposition, that's what we're attracting.",quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,26,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-18
"If you go to the wealth management business, this was a record quarter for net new households for Merrill Lynch and a record for the Private Bank, this quarter. That tells you we're offering people something that's valuable.",quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,26,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-18
"And then, we added 35,000 new bank accounts for people in our wealth management franchise. So, that again is a significant indicator that what we're offering as value to people.",quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,27,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-18
"And if I were to go back to my old business in business banking and commercial banking, they're adding new logos and new clients over time in a way that we're really happy with right now.",quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,27,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-18
"So, I think, the ultimate answer is, we are a purpose-driven company who put our clients' interests first. That is helping make their financial lives better. And in this period of time, people want stability and that's what we offer.",quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,27,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-18
All right. Thank you.,quarter,Mike Mayo,Analyst,27,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-18
We'll go next to Glenn Schorr with Evercore. Your line is open.,quarter,Operator,Host,27,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-18
"Hi, thanks. Maybe an easy one up first. It wasn't noticeable, but do you feel like there was a flight-to-quality benefit during the March Madness? I would have thought that people would have flocked to the safety of BofA during times like that, but you didn't comment specifically on that. So, thanks.",quarter,Glenn Schorr,Analyst,27,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-18
"So, we're going to decline, Glenn, to give a specific number. We're pretty confident we saw noticeable flight to safety.",quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,27,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-18
"And it comes in two parts. Part one is, during a period like March 10th and in around that week or two. And then just the second part that comes with onboarding clients over a period of time, who are trying to move operational accounts here and that takes a while, that has a lag.",quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,27,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-18
"So, you can think about, we get some of the deposits quite quickly, but relationships take longer time to build and onboard.",quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,27,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-18
"So, you can see from our numbers, it was improving before the disruption. We've chosen not to put an exact number on it, because there are typical ebbs and flows in any given quarter, leading up especially to a payroll end of quarter. But, generally speaking, I'd say, we were improving anyway. A lot of that is just organic growth, but we obviously benefited.",quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,28,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-18
"Okay. You noted though one more hike and then cuts through the back half of the year, that's the forward curve. What's interesting is the Fed doesn't have the same forward curve as the market has. So, I'm curious if you could talk to the sensitivity of what if there are no cuts, how much of that helps your forward NII thought process?",quarter,Glenn Schorr,Analyst,28,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-18
"Well, we do use the forward curve, because we feel like it's the most kind of dispassionate assessment with the most information out there in the market from the broader set of people and, importantly, it's not just us making it up.",quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,28,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-18
"So, we use the forward curve. And I even mentioned during my remarks, things are bouncing around, is it one hike? Is it zero? Is it two cuts? But the sensitivity that we provide around up 100 or down 100 is probably the best we can offer at this stage. And then, depending on how things develop, and they are developing quickly, it will allow you to adjust the model accordingly.",quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,28,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-18
"The last simple one is, held-to-maturity, you talked a lot about, I think the answer is, I know it, but I'll ask it bluntly anyway. So, you don't feel like you have to do anything material with your unrealized loss [indiscernible]. I get it, it's in treasuries, it's swaps, it's agency mortgages, you don't have a credit issue. But at this point, given the stability, your deposit base, loan growth, capital growth, do you feel like you can just kind of ride it out and grind it down?",quarter,Glenn Schorr,Analyst,28,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-18
"Correct. Right now, that's exactly what we've been doing. We've communicated that pretty clearly and that's what we're continuing to do. It just keeps getting smaller and shorter.",quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,29,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-18
Thank you. Appreciate it.,quarter,Glenn Schorr,Analyst,29,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-18
We'll go next to Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research. Your line is open.,quarter,Operator,Host,29,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-18
Hey. Good morning.,quarter,Steven Chubak,Analyst,29,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-18
"Good morning, Steven.",quarter,Brian Moynihan,CEO,29,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-18
"So, Alastair, you had mentioned some of the strong KPIs that you're seeing within GWIM, at the same time the business did see a pretty material decline in pre-tax margins, both sequentially and year-on-year. I wanted to better understand how the business might evolve under some of the new leadership? And how we should just be thinking about the margin trajectory? I wanted to better understand how you're balancing investment needs with goal of delivering continued profitability?",quarter,Steven Chubak,Analyst,29,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-18
"The margin came down largely because you had to sort of incremental hit to the investment side revenue as the markets fell year-over-year, but we'd expect that margin to move back up to its more traditional 20%, 25% to 30%.",quarter,Brian Moynihan,CEO,29,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-18
"But you also have to remember, they are a big beneficiary or hit of the elevated payroll taxes and other things in the first quarter, because as a percentage of our compensation in the company, they're not a small amount. So -- but we expect that to move back in the high-20%s.",quarter,Brian Moynihan,CEO,30,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-18
"But we have been working on this business to continue to improve the digitization of the services side of it. So, basically, if you think about it, you get [a dollar's worth] (ph) of the revenue and you take about half past the compensation in the financial advisory grids and the other payouts, and then we take the rest of it and convert it to about a 30% deposit, the other half and convert about 30 percentage points or 60% at the profit pre-tax this quarter, down a little bit, because of the payroll.",quarter,Brian Moynihan,CEO,30,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-18
"So, we feel very good about where we stand on a relative basis, but one of the things the team continues to work on across Eric and Lindsay and Katy is to drive operational excellence to new level in that business, because we believe that there is still a lot of costs that can come out around the simplicity -- more simple, straightforward products, the delivery of those products, the paper-based usage and things like that.",quarter,Brian Moynihan,CEO,30,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-18
"And then, also, remember, we are making investments in advisors.",quarter,Brian Moynihan,CEO,30,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-18
"We have 4,000 plus trainees in the businesses across the company, and we believe it the best advisors one is growing at our -- with our own company, and we continue to do that and that's a drag on the P&L that we're willing to take to make sure we have the advisor growth in the future.",quarter,Brian Moynihan,CEO,30,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-18
"Helpful color, Brian. And just for my follow-up, I was hoping, either you or Alastair could provide just an update on expectations around upcoming regulatory developments, specifically higher scenario planning for Basel IV, any expectations around the FDIC special assessment? There are a lot of items that have been floated just given recent events and the SBV fallout. I was hoping to get some perspective just in terms of regulatory mark-to-market.",quarter,Steven Chubak,Analyst,30,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-18
"I mean, I think we don't have anything more than you do in a broad sense, but I think, at the end of day, I think this industry has extremely strong capital liquidity and capabilities.",quarter,Brian Moynihan,CEO,31,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-18
"We just demonstrated through the pandemic and then through the aftermath of the pandemic and then through inflation and then through a tightening cycle, that hasn't happened before. So, we feel good about where the industry stands, and I think people have to step back and think about it overall.",quarter,Brian Moynihan,CEO,31,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-18
"And then, frankly, this industry in the United States is so much stronger than Europe. It has so much capital per square inch, so to speak, than Europe does to get to ratios, which on numbers are lower, but the amount of capital to get there is pretty unbelievable. So, we have twice the capitals of European counterparts of similar size and our ratios are considered to be lower. So, obviously, let's say, pull this together, they got to make sure they aren't counting the beans in different ways or the gold plating and other things in the United States.",quarter,Brian Moynihan,CEO,31,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-18
"So, hopefully, people will start to see the wisdom and making sure they are careful here and we'll see that play out, but we don't have any special understanding.",quarter,Brian Moynihan,CEO,31,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-18
All right. Thanks for taking my questions.,quarter,Steven Chubak,Analyst,31,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-18
We'll take our next question from Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.,quarter,Operator,Host,31,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-18
"Good morning. Just a quick clarification on the balance sheet and a several questions. The cash obviously went up a lot and you did allude to that moving some of those securities to cash, but the short-term borrowings was also up a lot. And I didn't know if that just to kind of hold more liquidity in the current environment and we should assume that continues, which I think weighs on NIM, but not the [NII] (ph) dollars, or was that just temporary in 1Q and we shouldn't pay too much attention to the period-end trends there?",quarter,Matt O'Connor,Analyst,31,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-18
"It's a little bit of both, Matt. You've got -- first quarter is just normally a seasonal build for us, so that happens, and a little bit of borrow. And you're right, it doesn't impact NIM, because you can invest it in cash three-way and there's no drag there, but it may hurt NOI slightly at the margin by a little bit.",quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,32,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-18
"Okay. All right. So, I think, you meant to say, it doesn't hurt the NII dollars that much, but it hurts the NIM percent, right?",quarter,Matt O'Connor,Analyst,32,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-18
Correct.,quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,32,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-18
"Yeah. Okay. And then, separately, any kind of trend to call out in spending in March? Some of your peers talked about a slowdown in March, and you highlighted kind of for the full quarter, debit and credit card was up 6% year-over-year and total payments up 9%. Any kind of intra-quarter trends that you want to point to?",quarter,Matt O'Connor,Analyst,32,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-18
"I think, we saw in the first part of the quarter -- first quarter, being a little bit -- a little bit softer and then we saw it kick back up in March.",quarter,Brian Moynihan,CEO,32,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-18
"So far in April, it's still early. It's probably a little lower than it was for the month of March, but it's a couple of weeks since. So, we got to be a little careful about that just due to the different ways vacations fall and things like that.",quarter,Brian Moynihan,CEO,33,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-18
"So -- but it's -- over the course of last year, the total spending year-over-year increases have slowed down and I think that means that's a precursor to the economy being a little bit slower and that we're seeing and then frankly consumers being more careful in the use of the cash, because the cash in their accounts -- in our accounts, especially for the lower income cohorts continues to build honestly.",quarter,Brian Moynihan,CEO,33,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-18
"From peak last April, it fell down a little bit all the course of the year, and it's built back up in the first part of this year.",quarter,Brian Moynihan,CEO,33,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-18
"So, we'll see that play out. There's been a delay in some of the tax returns as you know this year that pushes them from quarter-to-quarter, but stay tuned. I think, it's a little early to call, but it is a little softer in the first part of the April here.",quarter,Brian Moynihan,CEO,33,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-18
Okay. Thank you very much.,quarter,Matt O'Connor,Analyst,33,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-18
We'll go next to Vivek Juneja with J.P. Morgan. Your line is open.,quarter,Operator,Host,33,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-18
"Hi. Thanks. Just a couple of questions. I wanted to just clarify the shift to interest-bearing from non-interest bearing. I know you said you expect that to continue. Do you expect the pace of that to slow, or is it still -- it's still running very high or even to accelerate? Any color on that?",quarter,Vivek Juneja,Analyst,33,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-18
"Yeah. I'd expect it to slow over time, Vivek, because we're getting pretty close now to Q4 '19 levels anyway, which was the last peak.",quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,33,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-18
"And, also, if you think about the big driver, it tends to be global banking. And as rates are rising, clients are doing their rotation, but we're getting towards the end of the hikes now, we would think. So, you'd anticipate there'll be a little bit of a lag there. But, generally speaking, I'd expect it to slow at some point and I think we're probably getting close now.",quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,34,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-18
"One more, Alastair. Office CRE, you gave the geographical mix in your slides for the total CRE portfolio. Can you give us some similar thing for the office CRE portfolio?",quarter,Vivek Juneja,Analyst,34,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-18
"I can do, but I'm going to need to follow-up with you afterwards, because I don't have it in hand.",quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,34,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-18
Okay. Thank you.,quarter,Vivek Juneja,Analyst,34,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-18
But I don't think you're going to find anything there other than sort of typical geographic distribution similar to the way we serve our customers around the United States.,quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,34,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-18
Yeah. All right. Thanks.,quarter,Vivek Juneja,Analyst,34,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-18
We'll go next to Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Your line is open.,quarter,Operator,Host,34,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-18
"Good morning, Brian. Good morning, Alastair.",quarter,Gerard Cassidy,Analyst,35,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-18
Good morning. How are you doing?,quarter,Brian Moynihan,CEO,35,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-18
"Alastair, can you elaborate a little further, you talked about, I think in Slide 12, you showed us 100 basis point parallel shift impacts, net interest income by a positive $3.3 billion over the following 12 months. If the rate environment does shift and, maybe, we do start to see lower rates by the end of the year, how quickly can you guys move this from being asset sensitive to neutral or a liability sensitive on the balance sheet?",quarter,Gerard Cassidy,Analyst,35,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-18
"Well, I think, if you were to take that same metric on the downside, it would be -- probably, be down $3.6 billion for down 100, just to give some idea. And what's happening now is, obviously, as the interest-bearing piece just continues to rise across the company, we've got a hedge now as rates, if and when they start to go back down, it won't be a complete hedge, but it'll be a little bit of a hedge there. And then, you also get something back in terms of global markets NII, that will start leading back positively. So, there's some puts and some takes, but we'll see how that develops over the course of the year.",quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,35,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-18
"Very good. And then as a follow-up question, in the global banking slide, you guys gave us -- Slide 22, you had a negative provision in this quarter and you referenced that it's an improved macroeconomic outlook. Can you give us some color, what you're seeing there to give you confidence to have a negative provision?",quarter,Gerard Cassidy,Analyst,35,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-18
"And the second, does this also include the recent Shared National Credit exam results in this line item as well?",quarter,Gerard Cassidy,Analyst,36,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-18
"It would always include those results. Those come through continuously. It's -- there's not -- Gerard, there's a change over time, that's a continuous set of things they look at and we always do well on that.",quarter,Brian Moynihan,CEO,36,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-18
"And when we say macroenvironment, remember, this business set is credit across the world. So, there's places that we finished up on cleaning up. That allowed us to lease some reserves on one side and then we got to other places that we would have put up reserves, but at the end of the day the overall credit quality here is very strong and very stable.",quarter,Brian Moynihan,CEO,36,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-18
Very good. Appreciate it.,quarter,Gerard Cassidy,Analyst,36,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-18
"And you asked the question in commercial, correct?",quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,36,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-18
Yes.,quarter,Gerard Cassidy,Analyst,36,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-18
"Yeah, okay. So, I mean, I think, just a couple of things going on. Number one, we didn't have any real loan growth. Number two, the asset quality remains terrific. Number three, the macro environment when you look at the blue-chip consensus was ever so slightly better. So, we felt like we were pretty well provided for already. And then, on the commercial side, we had a little bit of exposure run-off in one or two places where we may have been reserved quite conservatively. So, it was all those things added together.",quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,36,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-18
"Okay. Actually, Brian and Alastair, you guys obviously have been through a few cycles. Why is commercial so strong? As you and your peers all have really good commercial credit quality, any suggestions on what you're seeing that makes this so good?",quarter,Gerard Cassidy,Analyst,37,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-18
"Well, their profitability remains in a good place. Cash flows remain in a good place. I think, corporate America learn something from 2009 and 2008. And so, leverage is in a good place. You add all that up, you got a decent environment overall for the economy and that's where we are with respect to credit quality. So, we'll have to watch that over time. But as of right now, it's in terrific shape.",quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,37,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-18
Great. Thank you very much.,quarter,Gerard Cassidy,Analyst,37,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-18
Our next question comes from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.,quarter,Operator,Host,37,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-18
Hi. Good morning.,quarter,Betsy Graseck,Analyst,37,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-18
"Good morning, Betsy.",quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,37,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-18
"Two questions. One, just keying off the loan discussion just now, could you give us a sense as to how you're thinking about lending standards and any changes in a post [SIVB] (ph) environment?",quarter,Betsy Graseck,Analyst,38,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-18
"Well, look, we don't really have a significant change to our risk appetite. We haven't changed our client selection. Those are largely speaking design to be through the cycle.",quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,38,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-18
"We will obviously adjust on specific concerns about asset quality performance in the sector or outlook. But, I'd say, with respect to our loan growth, it -- what we're seeing at more is, as the Fed raises rates, those rates are changing our customer demand. So, we just don't see as much demand right now for securities-based lending or mortgage, but it's less about credit tightening or standards, it's more about just Fed doing and having the effect that you would expect.",quarter,Alastair Borthwick,CFO,38,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-18
"Okay. And then two other quickies. One, on the consumer checking account balances in March, was that uptick in part a function of seasonality and end of period, end of pay cycle type of behavior, or is there something more going on there?",quarter,Betsy Graseck,Analyst,38,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-18
"Well, I think, as always, that's the cohort of pre-pandemic compared to where they were then and now. And they had been sort of bounce around and it leveled for the last six months and they moved up a little bit.",quarter,Brian Moynihan,CEO,38,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-18
"This is the time they do move up, because of the tax returns and other things and year-end payments and stuff. But they clearly are going -- they basically are stable from November, December, January. They started increasing in February and then they bounced up a little bit. So, we'll see where it ends up.",quarter,Brian Moynihan,CEO,38,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-18
"The clear message is, despite people having said these consumers are spending down their money, it would be out of these balances in mid-2022 or the third quarter, they clearly are still sitting with a fair amount of money in account relative to pre-pandemic times.",quarter,Brian Moynihan,CEO,39,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-18
"Okay. And then just lastly, AI, it's been a big topic recently as I'm sure you know. You've got Erica. Just wondering about plans to leverage AI, maybe you are going to be leveraging Erica on that, maybe it's a different credit strategy, but thoughts there would be helpful. Thank you.",quarter,Betsy Graseck,Analyst,39,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-18
"Yeah. So, Erica, obviously, the basic concept was built for us a number of years -- four or five, six, seven years ago starting and came out -- came into the business. It is a predictive language type of program, where you put in question and then it answers it, but we had to do a special language to make sure it would work with our business, it wasn't a general.",quarter,Brian Moynihan,CEO,39,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-18
"So, we did that. Then put us in a condition to start to deploy to our customers, because it's captive to our data, where it's just looking our systems, finding information and giving to clients is really a service capability. And what we've seen is that increase is a clear indicator of how valuable these types of artificial intelligence, natural language processing, predictive technologies can be for customer service and things like that.",quarter,Brian Moynihan,CEO,39,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-18
"We've also taken Erica internally and applied it to help us do work and we've seen it have those benefits. Ultimately, we think this has extreme benefits for our company. We think it has a lot -- and you've seen this written about in the computer coding areas. In other words, it could speed up the process of what they used to be called object programing. That goes on.",quarter,Brian Moynihan,CEO,39,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-18
"We think it has a lot to do in terms of allowing teammates to work much more quickly and efficiently with our systems and get information out and can make, even someone like me, the ability to do analytics, that I could -- I'd have to send to somebody and have them put, key it in the systems. So there's a lot of value to this.",quarter,Brian Moynihan,CEO,39,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-18
"The key question will be, when can you use it without the fear of -- with the -- the reason why a lot of it stopped in our industry and other industries was, it wasn't clear how it worked.",quarter,Brian Moynihan,CEO,39,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-18
"It was your data and the outside world's data and how it would interact and pull stuff out and we have to be careful with that. And then, secondly, we have to understand how the decisions are made, being able to stand up to the -- to our customers' demand for us to be fair and, frankly, follow the laws and rules and regulations on lending.",quarter,Brian Moynihan,CEO,40,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-18
"So, I think, all that is good, strong -- it's really important thing. So, we're not a neophyte in this sense, actually operating out there, we understand the value of it, but we will carefully apply it and we see a great value. I don't think it's a great value in the next month, but in the overall sense, it will help us continue to manage the headcount down, which we've been doing this quarter.",quarter,Brian Moynihan,CEO,40,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-18
"And, remember, we started this company -- management team started with this company in 2010 with 285,000 and 300,000 people working here and we're running the same size company with 216,000 people or bigger company doing more stuff and so all that's been aided by digitization of which is a potential step function change.",quarter,Brian Moynihan,CEO,40,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-18
Thanks so much. Appreciate it.,quarter,Betsy Graseck,Analyst,40,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-18
We'll take our final question at this time. This is a follow-up from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Your line is open.,quarter,Operator,Host,40,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-18
"Hi. In terms of your guidance for lower expenses in the second quarter, then the third quarter, then the fourth quarter, how much of that is expectations for slower business activity and how much of that is due to expected scale benefits from technology?",quarter,Mike Mayo,Analyst,40,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-18
"And I guess the bigger question too is, are you seeing evidence of a banking crisis? Are you seeing evidence of banking recession? And is that part of the reason for the expense guide?",quarter,Mike Mayo,Analyst,40,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-18
"No, it not -- Mike, I would say, there could be -- the activity in the first quarter was actually higher in some ways, because of the volatility in the trading side and things like that.",quarter,Brian Moynihan,CEO,41,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-18
"So, we aren't expecting -- we're expecting to get scale and operating leverage across activity taking less dollars to do it in the OpEx and the work we do. We had built-up more people, largely because the fear of last year of the turnover rate that is now gone in half in a year, requires us to be hiring a lot to stay ahead of it and then when it slowed down, we built-up people and we're bringing that back down in line.",quarter,Brian Moynihan,CEO,41,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-18
"But there is no -- the expenses frankly are just managing the headcount carefully, because that's two-thirds of the expense base and getting more leverage out of the activities. But there's no -- yeah, we'll have more checking accounts, we will have more credit card accounts, we'll do more wires on a given day, we'll do more trades on a given day, and that can ebb and flow, but, overall, we're expecting activity continue to rise.",quarter,Brian Moynihan,CEO,41,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-18
"Now, well, loan demand, i.e., people want to borrow another $10 versus the $10 ahead, that's what we say slows down. So that doesn't -- yeah, that's -- but that's not -- that they don't have a loan is that they borrow different amounts of money.",quarter,Brian Moynihan,CEO,41,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-18
"All right. So, this is really just managing the business, not your reduced investment spends, or anything like that?",quarter,Mike Mayo,Analyst,41,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-18
"No, in the investment spend, we're spending, we increase this year versus last year $300 million to $400 million in pure initiative spending and that's going through the run rate as we speak, and we aren't -- we wouldn't cut that, because we think to the point of Betsy's comment, it gives us a chance to continue to leverage the franchise and nowhere is that more evidenced in our consumer business, where the numbers of branches year-over-year are down a few 100 again.",quarter,Brian Moynihan,CEO,41,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-18
"Customers are bigger, more stuff's going through, customer delights were an all-time high, attrition is an all-time low, and that's what makes that franchise valuable as you well know and that's by continuing to invest in new capabilities at all-time.",quarter,Brian Moynihan,CEO,42,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-18
"And last thing, big picture for you, Brian, just the evidence that a recession is coming and the impact on you guys, where are you right now? Is it red? Is it flashing yellow? Or is it green? How has it moved? Just what's your -- what's the temperature?",quarter,Mike Mayo,Analyst,42,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-18
"[Candace] (ph) and research teams have been consistent to see after the Fed raises rates this amounts, there would be a, recession they have a mild recession and at that day predicted basically say 0.5% to 1% negative -- annualized negative GDP growth in Q3 and Q4 and Q1 and then back to positive.",quarter,Brian Moynihan,CEO,42,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-18
"So I think, in the end of the day, we don't see activity on the consumer side slowing at a pace that would indicate that, but we see, commercial customers are being more careful and things like that. But everything points to relatively mild recession, given the amount of stimulus that was put -- that was paid the people and the money they have leftover, the fact that unemployment is still at 3.5% -- full employment plus.",quarter,Brian Moynihan,CEO,42,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-18
"And then the wage growth is slowing in tipping over, so the size of inflation are tipping down but, they're still there, but that translates into good -- relatively good activity. So we see it as a slight recession and we'll see what happens, but we built this company across the last decade even in a stress scenario is that you'll see somewhere in the slides last quarter we didn't reduce because they're the same answer, our stress scenarios are always less than anybody else, because how we built the company through the go through recessions, without a problem, including the pandemic.",quarter,Brian Moynihan,CEO,42,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-18
"Got it. All right, thank you.",quarter,Mike Mayo,Analyst,43,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-18
"And at this time, I'd like to turn the program back over to Brian Moynihan for any additional or closing remarks.",quarter,Operator,Host,43,Conclusion,Q1_2023,2023-04-18
"Thank you for your time, and I want to thank my teammates for a great our performance again this first quarter of 2023, a strong quarter of 18% year-over-year EPS growth.",quarter,Brian Moynihan,CEO,43,Conclusion,Q1_2023,2023-04-18
"The strength and stability and being there for our customers continue to show through -- including strong capital at 11.4%, liquidity at $900 million in GLS.",quarter,Brian Moynihan,CEO,43,Conclusion,Q1_2023,2023-04-18
