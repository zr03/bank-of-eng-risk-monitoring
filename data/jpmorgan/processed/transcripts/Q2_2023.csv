"Moving to the Commercial Bank on page 7. Commercial Banking reported net income of $1.5 billion. Revenue of $3.8 billion was up 42% year-on-year, driven by higher deposit margins.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,3,Prepared remarks,Q2_2023,2023-07-14

"Net charge-offs were $100 million, including $82 million in the office real estate portfolio and the net reserve build of $389 million was driven by updates to certain assumptions related to the office real estate market as well as net downgrade activity in Middle Market Banking.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,3,Prepared remarks,Q2_2023,2023-07-14
"Then, to complete our lines of business, AWM on page 8. Asset & Wealth Management reported net income of $1.1 billion with pre-tax margin of 32%.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,3,Prepared remarks,Q2_2023,2023-07-14

"Next, the outlook on page 10. We now expect 2023 NII and NII ex. Markets to be approximately $87 billion, with the increase driven by higher rates coupled with slower deposit reprice than previously assumed across both Consumer and Wholesale.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,3,Prepared remarks,Q2_2023,2023-07-14
And I should take the opportunity to remind you once again that significant sources of uncertainty remain and we do expect the NII run rate to be substantially below this quarter's run rate at some point in the future as competition for deposits plays out.,quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,3,Prepared remarks,Q2_2023,2023-07-14
Our expense outlook for 2023 remains approximately $84.5 billion.,quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,4,Prepared remarks,Q2_2023,2023-07-14

"Nonetheless, despite the likely headwinds ahead, we remain optimistic about the company's ability to continue delivering excellent performance through a range of scenarios.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,4,Prepared remarks,Q2_2023,2023-07-14
"With that, operator, please open the line for Q&A.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,4,Prepared remarks,Q2_2023,2023-07-14
Please stand by. The first question is coming from the line of Jim Mitchell from Seaport Global Securities. You may proceed.,quarter,Operator,Host,4,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-14
"Thanks. Good morning. Hey, Jeremy, you talked about NII guidance up. Clearly, Fed Funds futures are up so it makes some sense. But maybe I guess first, could you kind of discuss – I guess comment on deposit behavior broadly around betas and mix and what you're seeing there so far?",quarter,Jim Mitchell,Analyst,4,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-14
It seems to be coming in a little better than expected.,quarter,Jim Mitchell,Analyst,4,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-14
"And then secondly, and probably more importantly, can you help us think about the implications of higher-for-longer rates on the outlook for NII next year and beyond? I guess the intermediate term outlook that you guys had talked about?",quarter,Jim Mitchell,Analyst,4,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-14
"Yeah, sure. Thanks, Jim. So, yeah, so when we talk about the drivers of the upward revision, as I said, it's higher rates coupled with lower deposit reprice; hard to untangle the two drivers.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,4,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-14
"And specifically, I think when you look at Consumer, the combination of the passage of time and the positive feedback we're getting from the field and the CD offerings in particular has meant that it's quite a kind of stable environment from that perspective.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,4,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-14
"And similarly, in Wholesale we're just seeing slower internal migrations.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,4,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-14
"You asked about mix. I think that obviously, we're seeing the CD mix increase and we would expect that to continue to take place probably even past the peak of the rate cycle into next year as we continue to capture money in motion.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,4,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-14
"But as you say, the most important point is the fact that, as I said earlier, we don't consider this level of NII generation to be sustainable.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,4,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-14
"And we talked previously about a sort of medium-term run rate in the mid-70s. That was before First Republic, and you could argue that maybe that number should be a little higher. But whatever it is, it's a lot lower than the current number.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,4,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-14
We don't know when that's going to happen. We're not going to predict the exact moment; that's going to be a function of competitive dynamics in the marketplace. But we want to be clear that we do expect it at some point.,quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,4,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-14
"Okay. But I guess just one follow-up on that. Just if we don't get rate cuts till middle of next year or later, does that sort of give some confidence to the outlook for next year or are you still worried about significant reprice?",quarter,Jim Mitchell,Analyst,4,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-14
"I wouldn't necessarily assume that the evolution from the current run rate into that mid-70s number is that sensitive to the rate outlook in particular. When we put that number out there, we looked at a range of different types of rate environments and the reprice that we think would be associated with that.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,4,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-14
"It was really meant to capture more of what we consider to be a through-the-cycle sustainable number, so I wouldn't think of it as being particularly rate-dependent.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,4,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-14
Okay. Great. Thanks.,quarter,Jim Mitchell,Analyst,4,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-14
"Next, we'll go to the line of Erika Najarian from UBS. You may proceed.",quarter,Operator,Host,5,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-14
"Hi. Good morning. Jeremy, I'm just laughing to myself because I said to you at Investor Day – do you have any more NII rabbits to pull out of the hat, and I guess you do.",quarter,Erika Najarian,Analyst,5,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-14
"So I guess, I want to ask a broader question really here. And maybe, Jamie, I'd like to get your thoughts. So you earned 23% ROTCE on 13.8% CET1, and we hear you loud and clear that you're more normalized NII generation is not $87 billion.",quarter,Erika Najarian,Analyst,5,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-14
"That being said, and fully taking into account the potential haircut from Basel III Endgame, is it possible that your natural ROTCE is maybe above that 17% through-the-cycle rate when rates aren't zero?",quarter,Erika Najarian,Analyst,5,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-14
"Because when you first introduced that ROTCE target, we were in a different world from a rate scenario and everybody's talking about even if the Fed cuts, the natural sort of bottom in Fed funds is not going to be zero. So any input on that would be great.",quarter,Erika Najarian,Analyst,5,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-14
"Yeah. Thanks, Erika. I mean, it's a good question. There's a lot in there, obviously. I guess I would start by saying that when we talked about the 17% through-the-cycle ROTCE, even though we may have introduced that in a moment when we were at the lower zero bound, it was always premised on a sort of normalized rate environment, and at some level that remains true today.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,5,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-14
"Furthermore, you didn't ask this explicitly, but in the context of the proposed Basel III Endgame, one relevant question might be if you have a lot more capital in the denominator, what happens to that target?",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,5,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-14
"So I think as I said in my prepared remarks, we feel very confident about the company's ability to produce excellent returns through the cycle. There's a lot of moving parts right now in that; some of them could be good, some of them could be bad.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,5,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-14
"Narrowly, on the capital one, the one thing to point out is that the straight-up math of simply diluting down the ROTCE by expanding the denominator misses the possibility of reprice, repricing of products and services, which of course goes back to our point that these capital increases do have impacts on the real economy.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,5,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-14
"So we're not suggesting that we can price our way out of it, but we obviously need to get the right returns on products and services, and where we have pricing power we will adjust to the higher capital.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,5,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-14
"So a lot of moving parts in there, but I think the important point is that through a range of scenarios we feel good about our ability to deliver good results. And we'll see how the mix of all the various factors plays out especially after we see the Basel III proposal and then go through the comment period.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,5,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-14
"And Erika, I would just add one thing. We do have a mix of businesses that earn from like 0% ROTCE to 100%. We have some which are very capital-intensive so we look at kind of all of them, and I think 17% is a good number and a good target.",quarter,Jamie Dimon,CEO,5,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-14
"The other thing we're over-earning on is credit. We've been over-earning on credit for a substantial amount of time now, we're quite conscious about it.",quarter,Jamie Dimon,CEO,5,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-14
"We know that it's going to pick up just as it normalizes, considerably more than now. Look, we would consider credit card normalizing to be closer to 3.5%.",quarter,Jamie Dimon,CEO,5,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-14
"And so my follow-up question there. Maybe, Jeremy, could you remind us what unemployment rate is embedded in your ACL ratio as of the second quarter?",quarter,Erika Najarian,Analyst,5,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-14
Yeah. It’s still 5.8%.,quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,5,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-14
Thank you.,quarter,Erika Najarian,Analyst,5,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-14
"Next, we'll go to the line of John McDonald from Autonomous Research. You may proceed.",quarter,Operator,Host,5,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-14
"Hi. Good morning. Jeremy, wanted to ask about capital in the wake of the Barr speech. We don't have the details yet, but just kind of wanted to ask about options that you have and strategies for mitigation both on RWA and potentially on the GSIB front as well as you contemplate what you heard recently.",quarter,John McDonald,Analyst,6,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-14
"Yeah. Thanks, John. So obviously, we're thinking about that a lot. On the other hand, as much as there have been a lot of very detailed rumors out there that might lead you to start to try to do some planning, it does seem like this time it's real and we are actually going to get a proposal presumably sometime this month or something.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,6,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-14
"So soon enough, we'll get to see something actually on paper and we can stop kind of the guesswork.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,6,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-14
"Having said that, indulging in a little bit of guesswork, it does seem like the biggest single driver of the increase that people are talking about, including Chair Powell's 20% number or Vice Chair Barr’s 2% of RWA which winds up being roughly the same, is just the way operational risk is getting introduced into the Standardized pillar.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,6,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-14
"And that is a little bit of a straight-up, across-the-board tax on everything.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,6,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-14
"It's kind of hard to optimize your way out of that, with the exception obviously of the fact that you can simply increase price, assuming you have pricing power, but that's obviously not what we want and that's what we sort of mean by impacts on the real economy.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,6,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-14
"So there are details, there is a lot of the FRTB stuff; we can get way into the weeds there within the Markets business. And we do have a good track record of adjusting and optimizing, but this time around, it may be a more fundamental set of questions around business mix as opposed to the ability to sort of optimize in a very technical way.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,6,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-14
"Okay. That's helpful. And with a number of years for this to phase in and you generating capital at a high level even if the ROTCE comes down a bit, how should we think about your pace of building capital for these new changes versus doing your everyday course of investing and buybacks and things like that over the next couple years?",quarter,John McDonald,Analyst,6,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-14
"Yeah. I mean, I guess I'm sort of tempted to give you our standard capital hierarchy here. I mean, we're not going to sacrifice investments, right? That won't come as a surprise to you.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,6,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-14
"Generally speaking, we're always going to try to comply with new requirements early. So when we know the requirements and when we have visibility, obviously given how much organic capital we're generating right now, whatever the answer winds up being it'll be pretty easy to comply, narrowly speaking.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,6,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-14
But that's not the same as saying that there won't be consequences to returns or to pricing.,quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,6,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-14
"And if for whatever reason things aren't exactly as we're anticipating, I don't see us sacrificing investments that we see as strategically critical in order to comply with higher capital requirements ahead of the formal timing or whatever.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,6,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-14
Okay. And there's some room for buybacks?,quarter,John McDonald,Analyst,6,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-14
"It's unlikely, obviously. That would be an unlikely outcome.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,6,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-14
Okay. Thank you.,quarter,John McDonald,Analyst,6,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-14
"Sorry, John. Go ahead. Did you have a follow-up?",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,7,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-14
"Yeah. No, just do buybacks play a role in the next couple years strategically? Do you episodically buy back?",quarter,John McDonald,Analyst,7,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-14
"I mean, capital hierarchy again, right? In the end, when we have nothing else to do with the money, we'll do buybacks.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,7,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-14
"And we talked about the $12 billion for this year. Obviously a lot of new moving parts there. Although all else equal, given what we've done so far, that's still probably a reasonable number for the full year.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,7,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-14
"But, yeah, that's always going to be at the end of the list. But, yeah.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,7,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-14
Got it. Okay. Thank you.,quarter,John McDonald,Analyst,7,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-14
"Next, we'll go to the line of Ken Usdin from Jefferies. You may proceed.",quarter,Operator,Host,7,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-14
Thanks. Good morning. I just wanted to ask a little bit about how you're feeling about the trade-off between like the commercial economy and what might come through in terms of future loan growth versus the kind of green shoots that people are talking about in the Investment Banking pipeline and just how it feels in terms of like re-opening of markets and the trade-off between getting some more of those fees in versus what's happening on the loan demand side. Thanks.,quarter,Ken Usdin,Analyst,7,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-14
"Sure. Good question, Ken. So I think in terms of Investment Banking and Markets, yeah, slightly better than expected last month. What I would talk about green shoots especially in Capital Markets generally, still definitely some headwinds in M&A, lower announced activity, some regulatory headwinds there, so we'll see.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,7,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-14
"I think it's a little too early to call a trend there based on recent results, but we'll see.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,7,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-14
"In terms of the broader economy and loan growth expectations, generally, we do still expect reasonably robust Card loan growth. But away from that for a variety of different reasons and different products, whether it be mortgage or C&I after revolver normalization, and especially if we see a little bit of a cooling off of the economy, I would expect loan demand to be relatively modest there, so we're not really expecting meaningful growth away from Card.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,7,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-14
"But of course, we're there for the right deals, right products, right terms. We lend through the cycle, so I see that as more of a demand-driven narrative which will be a function of the economy rather than any tightening on our side.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,7,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-14
"That makes sense. And as a follow-up to that, on the Consumer side you mentioned that consumers continue to spend albeit a little more slowly, and you mentioned that consumers are also using their excess deposits a little bit more as well. Can you just elaborate a little bit more on just your feeling about the state of the consumer? And is that Card growth continue to be driven by people needing to revolve as opposed to wanting to have more in their deposits? Just kind of want the trade-off on that side too?",quarter,Ken Usdin,Analyst,7,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-14
"Yeah. I mean, to us I think we still see this as a normalization, not deterioration story when we talk about consumer credit.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,8,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-14
"Actually, revolve per account has still not gotten to pre-pandemic levels actually, so I would definitely say that it's a wanting rather than needing at least for our portfolio at this point.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,8,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-14
"And, yeah, I think the consumer continues to surprise on the upside here.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,8,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-14
Got it. Okay. Thank you.,quarter,Ken Usdin,Analyst,8,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-14
"Next, we'll go to the line of Gerard Cassidy from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.",quarter,Operator,Host,8,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-14
"Good morning, Jeremy. Good morning, Jamie. Jeremy, can you give us your view on how you're measuring the treasury functions and the asset liability of your balance sheet as we go forward versus the way you guys were positioning and managing it a year ago in view of the fact that it looks like maybe we're approaching the terminal rate on Fed funds rates?",quarter,Gerard Cassidy,Analyst,8,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-14
"Yeah. Gerard, I would say honestly not much changed there actually. We have been pretty consistently concerned about the risk of higher rates. Of course, we always try to position things to produce reasonable outcomes across a broad range of scenarios.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,8,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-14
"But at the margin, we've been biased towards higher rates, and that may be a little less true at these levels than it was before, although a lot of that is just the consequence of deposit convexity playing out in the modeling.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,8,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-14
"But in any case, all else equal, I think we are going to continue to focus on making sure we're fine in a higher rate scenario while staying balanced across a range of scenarios.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,8,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-14
"So not really a lot of change in our positioning, and that's obviously including the fact that we took on First Republic which, even net of some of the liabilities, had a long structural interest rate position. We did not actually want to get longer as part of the deal, and so as a result we took actions to ensure that net-net we are still about the same as we were last quarter.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,8,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-14
"Very good. And then as a follow-up, you mentioned in giving us the read-through on the Commercial Banking segment of the business that you had some reserve building tied to some office real estate and also some downgrades in the Middle Market area. Can you go a little deeper? What are you guys seeing in this area, both Commercial Real Estate but also the C&I loans? What's happening in that segment as well?",quarter,Gerard Cassidy,Analyst,8,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-14
"Yeah. So I would caution you from drawing too broad a conclusion from this. I mean, I think that when we talk about office for example, our portfolio as you know is quite small and our exposure to sort of so-called urban dense office is even smaller.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,8,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-14
"The vast majority of our overall portfolio is multi-family lending so as a result, like our sample size of observed valuations on office properties is quite small.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,8,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-14
"But you know we like to be sort of ahead of the cycle, and based on everything that we saw this quarter it just felt reasonable to build a little bit there to get to what felt like a comfortable coverage ratio.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,8,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-14
"In the Middle Market segment, we saw downgrades in excess of upgrades, but I don't see that as sort of necessarily indicative of anything terribly significant in the broader read-across.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,8,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-14
Thank you.,quarter,Gerard Cassidy,Analyst,8,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-14
"Next, we'll go to the line of Steve Chubak from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.",quarter,Operator,Host,9,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-14
"Steve, you there?",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,9,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-14
It looks like his line dropped so next we'll go to the line of Ebrahim Poonawala from Bank of America. You may proceed.,quarter,Operator,Host,9,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-14
"Good morning. I guess just first question, following up on the outlook for the economy. Like, we've all been worried about the recession for a year and there's a debate about the lagged effects of the Fed rate hike cycle. When you think about – Jeremy, I think you mentioned your unemployment outlook relatively similar today versus a quarter ago – how worried should we be in terms of the credit cycle 6 to 12 months from now? Or are you leaning towards concluding that maybe U.S. businesses, consumers have absorbed the rate cycle a lot better than we expected a year ago?",quarter,Ebrahim H. Poonawala,Analyst,9,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-14
"Yeah. So, I mean, I'm sure Jamie has some views here. But in my view, I would just caution against jumping to too many super-positive conclusions based on a couple of recent prints. And I think generally, our point is less about trying to predict a particular outcome and more about trying to make sure that we don't get too much euphoria that over-concentrates people on one particular prediction when we know that there's a range of outcomes out there.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,9,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-14
"So obviously, people are talking a lot about the potential for soft-landing right now, no landing, immaculate disinflation or whatever. And whether our own views on that have changed meaningfully, I don't know.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,9,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-14
"But the broader point is that we continue to be quite focused on Jamie's prior comment that loss rates still have room to normalize even post-pandemic, so we're probably over-earning on credit a little bit.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,9,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-14
"Obviously, we've talked about the expectation that the NII is going to come down quite a bit. So even forgetting about whether you get some surprisingly negative outcomes on the economy from where we stand today, even in a central case you just need to recognize that there should be some significant normalization.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,9,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-14
Yeah. And I would just add that the 5.8% is not our prediction. That is the average of the unemployment under multiple scenarios that we have to use which are hypothetical for CECL. So you have this prediction that's going to always look something different and we don't know the outcome.,quarter,Jamie Dimon,CEO,9,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-14
"We try to be really clear here – the consumer is in good shape, they're spending down their excess cash – that's all tailwinds.",quarter,Jamie Dimon,CEO,9,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-14
"Even if we go to a recession, they're going with rather good conditions, low borrowings and good house price values still.",quarter,Jamie Dimon,CEO,9,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-14
"But the headwinds are substantial and somewhat unprecedented. There's war in Ukraine, oil and gas, quantitative tightening, unprecedented fiscal needs of governments, QT which we never experienced before. I just think people should take a deep breath on that.",quarter,Jamie Dimon,CEO,9,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-14
"We don't know if those things could put us in a soft landing, a mild recession or a hard recession. And obviously, we all hope for the best.",quarter,Jamie Dimon,CEO,9,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-14
"Got it. And just a follow-up on the upcoming Basel reforms, two questions. You've talked about the impact to the U.S. economy, like others have said the same. At this point, is that falling on deaf ears? And secondly, maybe, Jeremy, if you can touch upon just structural changes that you expect to make in the Capital Markets business because of FRTB. Thank you.",quarter,Ebrahim H. Poonawala,Analyst,9,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-14
"Yeah. So on your first point, I mean, I think you can just read Vice Chair Barr's speech, right?",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,9,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-14
Yeah.,quarter,Ebrahim H. Poonawala,Analyst,10,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-14
"He addressed that point fairly directly. He clearly doesn't agree as is his right, so we'll see what happens.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,10,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-14
"We continue to feel that, all else equal, higher capital requirements definitely are going to increase the cost of credit, which is bad for the economy, so we'll see what happens on that.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,10,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-14
"On FRTB, it's really very nuanced. It's probably too much detail for this call, to be honest. But just to give you like one immaterial and insignificant but useful example, one product under FRTB is yield curve spread options.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,10,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-14
"And if the FRTB proposal goes through as currently written, that product just becomes not viable. So, obviously, if we need to stop doing that product, no one really cares. But it's just one example of the way sometimes, when you're really disciplined about allocating capital thoroughly all the way down to individual products and responding accordingly, you can wind up having to change your business mix.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,10,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-14
"There are obviously more significant products that matter much more for the real economy like mortgage where the layering-on of the operational risk and the way it's being proposed, especially if some of the other beneficial elements of the proposal don't come through, you're once again making that product even harder to offer to homeowners. So we'll see, we'll see what happens.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,10,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-14
"I would just add to that. Even if your product doesn't make money, you might do it for clients who are great clients. You're going to manage by product, by client, and by effectively business mix, and those need adjustments.",quarter,Jamie Dimon,CEO,10,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-14
"Roughly, loans don't make sense to put on your balance sheet as a whole, almost any loan, and people have to recognize that. And so we just manage through all the various complications here and figure out what the hell to do.",quarter,Jamie Dimon,CEO,10,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-14
Okay. Thank you.,quarter,Ebrahim H. Poonawala,Analyst,10,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-14
"Next, we'll go to the line of Mike Mayo from Wells Fargo Securities. You may proceed.",quarter,Operator,Host,10,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-14
"Hi. I had another question on Vice Chair Barr's speech from this week. To the extent that capital ratios do go up 20% for you and perhaps others, to what degree would you think about changing your business model in terms of remixing where you do business, repricing or simply removing activities that you used to do?",quarter,Mike Mayo,Analyst,10,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-14
"It's kind of ironic, or maybe it's not ironic, that Apollo hits an all-time stock price high at the same week of the speech. So how much business leaves JPMorgan or the industry if capital ratios do go up as much as potentially proposed?",quarter,Mike Mayo,Analyst,10,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-14
"Yeah. Mike, I mean...",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,10,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-14
"Wait. Before Jeremy answers the question, this is great news for hedge funds, private equity, private credit, Apollo, Blackstone – and they’re dancing in the streets.",quarter,Jamie Dimon,CEO,10,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-14
"Yeah, exactly. And I was going to say, Mike, yes to everything, so meaning repricing, yes, definitely.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,11,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-14
"To the extent that we have pricing power and the higher capital requirements mean that we're not generating the right returns for shareholders, we will try to reprice and we'll see how that sticks and how that flows into the economy and how that affects demand for products.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,11,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-14
"And if the repricing is not successful, then in some cases we will have to remix and that means getting out of certain products and services.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,11,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-14
"And as Jamie points out, that probably means that those products and services leave the regulated perimeter and go elsewhere, and that's fine. As Jamie points out, those people are clients and I think that point was addressed also in Vice Chair Barr's speech.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,11,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-14
"But traditionally, having risky activities leave the regulated perimeter has had some negative consequences, so these are all important things to consider.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,11,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-14
"Alright, and separate question. I appreciate the Investor Day – gives a little bit more color on the degree that your investments may or may not pan out; we are still all watching that closely.",quarter,Mike Mayo,Analyst,11,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-14
"Having said that, you just increased revenue guidance by $10 billion for NII between this quarter and the first quarter without changing expense guidance by even $1. Aren't you tempted to spend a little bit more? Why not spend more if you're gaining share?",quarter,Mike Mayo,Analyst,11,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-14
"And I'm not saying that you should; I'm just wondering like aren't you tempted to do so? You have $10 billion more revenues and you're not spending $1 more of expenses. Like, why not?",quarter,Mike Mayo,Analyst,11,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-14
"Mike, let me get this right. You're actually complaining that our expenses aren't high enough? Is that right?",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,11,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-14
"Wait, wait. Just to be clear. It's just the flip side of the question I asked for two years, going back to it.",quarter,Mike Mayo,Analyst,11,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-14
"Fair enough. I appreciate the balance. In all seriousness, we've always been pretty clear, right, that our spending is through-the-cycle spending based on through-the-cycle investment, through-the-cycle spending based on our through-the-cycle view of the earnings-generating power of the company and the goal to produce the right returns.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,11,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-14
"So broadly speaking, NII tends to flow straight through to the bottom line, both when it's going up and, by the way, when it's going down too, and we've been through those moments as you well remember.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,11,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-14
"So whether or not there are opportunities to deploy some more dollars into marketing and stuff like that, we have actually looked at that recently. I don't see that being a meaningful item this year, which is part of why we have not revised the expense guidance so far.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,11,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-14
But this is about investing through the cycle and being honest and disciplined about which revenue items carry expense loading and which of them don't.,quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,11,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-14
And then last quick follow-up...,quarter,Mike Mayo,Analyst,11,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-14
"Mike, I think we're kind of running as fast as we can. So if you actually sat down directly with credit compliance, auto market, bankers, recruiters, traders – Mike, this is it. We're full effort right now and we want to make sure we get things right and get things thoughtful and careful. So it's not just the money, it's the people and how many things you can change all at once and add to all at once.",quarter,Jamie Dimon,CEO,11,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-14
"And then one quick follow-up to that. Your efficiency ratio this quarter is the lowest we've seen in a long, long time and I guess you're saying don't extrapolate this efficiency ratio because NII will come down at some point. But when you just simply look at – you benchmark yourself against the low-cost providers, where do you think you're there now and where can you still go because if you extrapolate this quarter, you're getting closer?",quarter,Mike Mayo,Analyst,12,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-14
"Yeah. I mean, you said it yourself, right? You definitely can't extrapolate the current numbers.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,12,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-14
"But I think more broadly on benchmarking ourselves to low-cost providers, it sort of speaks to an area that you've been interested in for a long time which is all of the investment that we're doing in technology to improve generally scalability and get more of our cost base to be variable versus fixed in terms of how we respond to volumes – that's a big part of the reason that we're doing the investments that we're doing, and modernization and cloud and AI and all the type of stuff that we've talked about a lot.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,12,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-14
"So I think we feel really good about our efficiency as a company, but there definitely is room for improvement.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,12,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-14
Alright. Thank you.,quarter,Mike Mayo,Analyst,12,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-14
"Next, we'll go to the line of Steven Chubak from Wolfe Research. You may proceed.",quarter,Operator,Host,12,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-14
"Hey. Thanks for taking the question and apologies for the technical issues earlier. Wanted to ask on the deposit outlook – just with signs that recent liquidity drawdown has come predominantly out of RRP versus industry deposits, just wanted to get your thoughts on what expectations you have for deposit growth in the second half, both for you and even the broader industry, especially as Treasury issuance really begins to ramp in earnest.",quarter,Steven Chubak,Analyst,12,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-14
"Yeah. Good question, Steve, so let me say a couple things about this. So obviously, our deposit numbers have bounced around a little bit as a function of some of the turmoil that we saw in regional banks as well as obviously the First Republic transaction.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,12,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-14
"But now, if you look at our kind of end-of-period deposits this quarter and you project forward, our core view is that we would expect a sort of modest downward trend to re-assert itself from this higher starting point, broadly as a function of QT playing through the system but noting that we do have some hope for offsets by taking share.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,12,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-14
"Just to give a couple examples, like in Consumer, we've got some of our branch expansion markets seasoning and so there are share opportunities there.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,12,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-14
"And in Wholesale, we’ve obviously invested a lot in products and services and so we think we have compelling offerings that are helping us win mandates, and so there are potentially some share offsets there. But broadly, our core view remains modest deposit declines across the franchise.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,12,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-14
"Within that, you note the same thing we've noted that as we got through the debt ceiling and the TGA build has come into effect, and you've seen a lot of bill issuance, big question in the market about whether that was going to come out of reserves or come out of RRP. And so far, with most of the TGA build – I guess they're targeting $600 billion and they're at $550 billion – or something so they're almost done, more of it than some people feared has come out of RRP.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,12,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-14
"So as you say, I think that's a relatively good sign and highlights how the system works better when you've got ample supply of short-dated collateral on the front end of the yield curve. So that whole RRP/TGA bank reserve dynamic is going to continue to be significant, but it is good to see RRP coming down a little bit.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,12,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-14
"Helpful color, and just a follow-up on Card income. Revenues were muted in the quarter. I was hoping you could unpack just the sources of pressure. Maybe more specifically, how much of a drag is associated with FAS 91 versus some other factors.",quarter,Steven Chubak,Analyst,12,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-14
"Yeah. So actually, that Card income number, Steve, is a little bit of a one-off thing. So we had a reward liability adjustment this quarter, kind of a technical thing, so that's just a temporary headwind.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,13,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-14
"And also, the sequential comparison is also getting hurt by a small positive one-off item in the prior period. And obviously, I know you guys looked at it, but Card income isn't sort of a thing we look at that much ourselves.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,13,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-14
Can you size the reward liability impact?,quarter,Steven Chubak,Analyst,13,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-14
Why don't you get Mikael to give that to you? It's not that significant but it's enough to just make the sequential number look a little bit wonky.,quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,13,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-14
Great. Thanks for taking my questions.,quarter,Steven Chubak,Analyst,13,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-14
"Next, we'll go to the line of Glenn Schorr from Evercore ISI. You may proceed.",quarter,Operator,Host,13,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-14
"Thank you. Just want to follow-up on this pricing power conversation because you've been consistent over time that you have a limited ability to sustain pricing power due to the competitive landscape. But I guess my question is if not now, when? Meaning, a lot has changed on the institutional side, the European bank side, the regional bank side and I would think that there’d be certain businesses that you have a greater ability and willingness to push price on.",quarter,Glenn Schorr,Analyst,13,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-14
And then maybe you could tie that to your comments in the press release on what are the material – what are the real-world consequences for markets and end users that you're referring to when talking about material regulatory changes? Thanks a lot.,quarter,Glenn Schorr,Analyst,13,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-14
"Sure. So, look, on pricing power, you're right – it really depends on the product and it depends on the competitive landscape across different banks, and so it's very granular, it's very product-specific and in some cases we'll have more pricing power than in other cases.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,13,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-14
"I think the overall point that we're trying to make in connection with Basel III Endgame is just that like we think the capital increases are excessive and it puts pressure on returns all else equal, that obviously puts pressure on us to increase price where we can.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,13,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-14
"That is generally a bad thing for the real economy and how all that plays out in detail across different products and services remains to be seen, importantly since we don't actually have the proposal yet – so we need those details. And sorry, Glenn I forgot the second half of your question. What was it?",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,13,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-14
"Actually, I think you hit on it so I'll just do a follow-up on a related. So the notion of private credit doing large traditional investment-grade lending activity is maybe part of the competitive landscape that limits the ability to push price. In Jamie's letter, you talked about the downside – or my question is what's the downside if more of the mortgage credit asset-backed intermediation business is pushed out of the banking system?",quarter,Glenn Schorr,Analyst,13,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-14
"I mean, I guess it depends on what you mean by downside. But I just think societally speaking, I think we've seen in recent history that when home lending is happening outside the regulated perimeter and things get bad, when you have economic downturns, it produces bad outcomes for individuals and homeowners and society as a whole, and Jamie has written about this extensively.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,14,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-14
"Beyond that, financially, we've talked about how mortgage lending – I mean, the profitability swings obviously is reasonably cyclical and the recent past has actually been very profitable, then it was less so. Like, the correspondent channel right now is actually picking up a little bit.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,14,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-14
"But it's a thin-margin business, it's challenging. And when you increase the capital requirements, it makes it even harder so that just becomes one of the areas where you're in that tension between remixing versus pricing power that we talked about a second ago.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,14,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-14
"And it might, in fact, mean that we do less – less credit available for homeowners and more regulatory risk as the activity moves outside the perimeter.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,14,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-14
"Appreciate that, Jeremy.",quarter,Glenn Schorr,Analyst,14,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-14
"Next, we'll go to the line of Betsy Graseck from Morgan Stanley. You may proceed.",quarter,Operator,Host,14,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-14
Hi. Good morning.,quarter,Betsy L. Graseck,Analyst,14,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-14
"Hi, Betsy.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,14,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-14
"I just wanted to unpack a little bit more the drivers of the change you outlined that's coming in the 10-Q, Jeremy, regarding the asset sensitivity going from liability-sensitive to asset-sensitive, at least that's the way I read it. I just wanted to understand what the drivers of that is.",quarter,Betsy L. Graseck,Analyst,14,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-14
"Yeah, sure. No problem, Betsy. I mean, as you know, that's always been a challenging number. It's meant as a risk management measure of sorts, although it's also somewhat limited in that respect, and it has been of uneven usefulness in terms of a tool to be able to predict our NII trajectory when rates change.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,14,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-14
"But as we've looked at that and try to improve it and spoken to all of you through this latest rate hiking cycle, we've come to the conclusion that it would improve the usefulness of the disclosure if we included in the modeling the effect of deposit repricing lags.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,14,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-14
"And so, we've done that and that just has the effect that I talked about – it increases the EaR number about $4 billion from minus $1.5 billion, which is roughly what it was last quarter and what it would've been this quarter without the change to something more like $2.5 billion.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,14,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-14
So then…,quarter,Betsy L. Graseck,Analyst,14,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-14
"All the usual caveats apply, right? I mean, it's never – the answer is going to always – for any given change in rates, the change in our NII is always going to be for one reason or another different from what that disclosure shows. But we do our best to make it easy.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,15,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-14
"Okay. And so, is it fair for me to think about that change as a mark-to-market to where we are today? And when I think about your forward guide here, longer-term you're saying, look, deposit betas are accelerating. So as I go through the 10-Qs over the next four, five quarters, I should expect that that $2.5 billion should come down because deposit betas you're anticipating are going to be accelerating from here? I'm just trying to put those two things together.",quarter,Betsy L. Graseck,Analyst,15,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-14
"Yeah, it's a good question. It's quite a technical issue. So I think in the past, the way this number was constructed was to assume through-the-cycle betas on all the deposits, and so your notion that like the number would include deposit beta acceleration would not have been the case because it would've been using essentially terminal deposit betas based on the forward curve and then based on a 100% shock to the forward curve.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,15,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-14
"The nuance that we've introduced now is to recognize that given the shock, the reprice that the beta predicts will not be instantaneous, and so you get sort of just the mathematical consequences of that.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,15,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-14
But I think translating that into a statement about our expectation for beta for the next 12 months relative to our NII guide might be a bridge too far. I'm not sure you can actually draw that conclusion.,quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,15,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-14
"Right. But you were saying earlier deposit betas you do anticipate are going to be accelerating from here, and that's part of the outlook for NII longer-term to normalize in the mid-70s. Is that right?",quarter,Betsy L. Graseck,Analyst,15,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-14
"Yes, but let me emphasize something on that. Go ahead, Jamie.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,15,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-14
"Yeah. I mean, basically, yes. If you have – if the next round is going to be the beta will be 30 to 40 to 50 bps, I mean, whatever the product is, yeah, that's the lag. And the $2.5 billion will go down over time as that actually happens – if rates actually go up. If rates don't actually go up, that $2.5 billion may be exactly $2.5 billion again.",quarter,Jamie Dimon,CEO,15,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-14
Yeah.,quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,15,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-14
Got it.,quarter,Betsy L. Graseck,Analyst,15,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-14
"Yeah, exactly. And what I was going to say, Betsy, is just that the projection of the $87 billion coming down to a significantly lower number contains both the element of internal migration as well as the potential, which is by no means guaranteed, of product-level reprice. And furthermore then, obviously the dynamics are a little bit different in the different business segments as you move from large corporate Wholesale to Consumer.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,16,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-14
Okay. All right. Thank you. Appreciate it.,quarter,Betsy L. Graseck,Analyst,16,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-14
Yeah.,quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,16,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-14
"Next, we'll go to the line of Matt O'Connor from Deutsche Bank. You may proceed.",quarter,Operator,Host,16,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-14
"Good morning. So I'm in your camp that eventually consumers will want more deposit rate sensitivity here. But I guess what would make you change your rates meaningfully? So the top two banks have about 50% consumer market share, loan-to-deposit ratios are low. Your outlook for loan growth, and I think others, is fairly sluggish, at least outside of Card. I get that it's common sense, and that's what we've seen historically. But there really is this kind of big divergence among big banks and everybody else where the big banks just don't need to pay that much for deposits for a slew of reasons. So what would make you change that?",quarter,Matt O'Connor,Analyst,16,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-14
"Yeah. In the end, Matt, it's just feedback from the field. It's competition and feedback from the field. We – Jamie, go ahead.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,16,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-14
"I think every bank is in a different position about what they need, and so you have a whole range of outcomes. But remember, we do this also by city, so you have different competition in Arizona – in Phoenix – than you have in Chicago, Illinois. And when you do have high interest rate products, so it's a combination of all those things.",quarter,Jamie Dimon,CEO,16,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-14
"I wouldn't call it big bank versus small bank, and you're going to see when everyone reports who kind of paid up a little more for things and who didn't and things like that.",quarter,Jamie Dimon,CEO,16,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-14
"So, look, guys, I would take it as a given. I think it's a mistake. There is very little pricing power in most of our business and betas are going to go up. Take it as a given. There is no circumstance that we've ever seen in the history of banking where rates didn't get to a certain point that you had to have competing products. And rates go up through migration or direct rates or movement to CDs or money market funds. We're going to have to compete for that – you already see it in parts of our business, and not in other parts.",quarter,Jamie Dimon,CEO,16,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-14
Yeah. I 100%...,quarter,Matt O'Connor,Analyst,16,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-14
"Yeah. Matt, it's really just about primary bank relationships in the end. That's the core of the strategy.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,16,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-14
"Yeah. I mean, again, I 100% agree, but we've never seen kind of loans-to-deposit ratios for banks like yours this low, so you could just let deposits run off at a modest amount for quite some time and make the decision not to pay up. I mean, I've seen the trade-off that eventually you'll...",quarter,Matt O'Connor,Analyst,17,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-14
"But that's a little more complicated because a lot of that loan-to-value ratio is lower because of regulatory stuff, LCR, capital ratio, etcetera.",quarter,Jamie Dimon,CEO,17,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-14
Got it. Okay. All right. Thank you.,quarter,Matt O'Connor,Analyst,17,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-14
Thanks.,quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,17,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-14
"And for our final question, we'll go to Charles Peabody from Portales Partners. You may proceed.",quarter,Operator,Host,17,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-14
"Morning. Jeremy, on page 4 of your presentation, you show some liquidity metrics. And there's been a meaningful deterioration, or I shouldn't say deterioration, depletion of some of that excess liquidity, obviously for First Republic primarily. So my question is how quickly do you want to rebuild that liquidity because as I look out towards 2024, there's probably a half dozen variables that are going to make liquidity a premium event – to have excess liquidity? So that's my first question. What's your plans for replenishing that liquidity?",quarter,Charles W. Peabody,Analyst,17,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-14
"Yeah. Charlie, so I know we talked about this a little bit at Investor Day, right? So as I said in my prepared remarks, yeah, we think about half of the change in the bank LCR number is a consequence of First Republic and the rest of it is just the expected decrease in system-wide deposits flowing through into our HQLA balances and the bank LCR ratio.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,17,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-14
"So that's all entirely as expected and therefore, I think that the replenishing notion is not correct. In fact, obviously, we still have ample, ample liquidity.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,17,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-14
"Now, if you want to project trends forward, that's a different story but that's sort of the business of banking. We'll adjust accordingly in terms of our asset and liability mix across different products and to ensure compliance to the ratios and fortress balance sheet principles as you would expect from us.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,17,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-14
"And I would just add to that – just look at the top of the page in the press release, $1.4 trillion of cash and marketable securities. Even if we get down to no excess, we're going to have like, I forgot the exact number, $1.2 trillion. I think we have excess liquidity, and the liquidity ratio is slightly something different. I think there's plenty of liquidity in the system and, of course, we do multiple things to change this overnight if we wanted to.",quarter,Jamie Dimon,CEO,17,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-14
"All right. So sort of wrapped into that as a follow-up, if you take your $87 billion forecast for NII this year, and that implies at least one quarter of maybe $22 billion of NII, and you take your eventual forecast of mid-$70 billion of NII at some point in the future, that would imply at least one quarter of $18 billion of NII so that's about an 18% drop. And if you hold the balance sheet steady, you're talking about a 30-basis point drop in your margin, your NIM, to get from $22 billion to $18 billion. I mean, what is driving – is it really the deposit or are you thinking in terms of interest reversals as credit deteriorates or is it rebuilding of liquidity? I'm just trying to get a better sense of the impact is.",quarter,Charles W. Peabody,Analyst,18,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-14
"Yeah. Hey, Charlie. I would think about that as being really entirely a deposit story. It's just not that complicated, right? I think we did this – I think it was either in the fourth quarter or in the first quarter – where we put a little chart on a page, just very simple terms, that shows what the dollar consequences are of whatever – like 10-basis point change in deposit rate paid in terms of NII run rate.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,18,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-14
"So whether it's as a consequence of migration from lower-yielding to higher-yielding, going from 0% to a 4% CD is obviously a big impact on margin. Or whether it's because savings reprices, relatively small changes in rate there are kind of a lot of money when you've got a couple trillion dollars of deposits. So it's really not any more complicated than that and that's why we're being so forceful about reminding people about what we expect that trajectory to be.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,18,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-14
Thank you.,quarter,Charles W. Peabody,Analyst,18,Q and A,Q2_2023,2023-07-14
