"Thank you and good morning, everyone. Starting on page 1, the Firm reported net income of $12.9 billion, EPS of $4.37 on revenue of $43.3 billion with an ROTCE of 19%.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,2,Prepared remarks,Q3_2024,2024-10-11
"Touching on a couple of highlights. In CCB, we ranked number one in retail deposit share for the fourth straight year, in CIB, both IB fees and Markets revenue were notably up year-on-year reflecting strength across the franchise. In AWM, we had record quarterly revenues and record long-term flows.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,2,Prepared remarks,Q3_2024,2024-10-11
"Now, turning to page 2 for the Firmwide results. The Firm reported revenue of $43.3 billion, up $2.6 billion or 6% year-on-year.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,2,Prepared remarks,Q3_2024,2024-10-11
"NII ex. Markets was up $274 million or 1% driven by the impact of balance sheet mix and securities reinvestment, higher revolving balances in Card and higher wholesale deposit balances, predominantly offset by lower deposit balances in Banking & Wealth Management and deposit margin compression.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,2,Prepared remarks,Q3_2024,2024-10-11
"NIR ex. Markets was up $1.8 billion or 17%, but excluding the prior year’s net investment securities losses, it was up 10% on higher asset management and investment banking fees. And Markets revenue was up $535 million or 8% year-on-year.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,2,Prepared remarks,Q3_2024,2024-10-11
"Expenses of $22.6 billion were up $808 million or 4% year-on-year, driven by compensation, including revenue-related compensation and growth in employees, partially offset by lower legal expense.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,2,Prepared remarks,Q3_2024,2024-10-11
"And credit costs were $3.1 billion reflecting net charge-offs of $2.1 billion and a net reserve build of $1 billion, which included a $182 million in Consumer, primarily in Card, and $144 million in Wholesale. Net charge-offs were up $590 million year-on-year, predominantly driven by Card.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,2,Prepared remarks,Q3_2024,2024-10-11
"On to balance sheet and capital on page 3. We ended the quarter with a CET1 ratio of 15.3%, flat versus the prior quarter, as net income and OCI gains were offset by capital distributions and higher RWA. This quarter's RWA reflects higher lending activity, as well as higher client activity and market moves on the trading side.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,2,Prepared remarks,Q3_2024,2024-10-11
"We had $6.0 billion of net common share repurchases this quarter, which in part reflects the deployment of the proceeds from the sale of Visa shares, as we have previously mentioned.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,2,Prepared remarks,Q3_2024,2024-10-11
"Now, let's go to our businesses, starting with CCB on page 4. CCB reported net income of $4.0 billion on revenue of $17.8 billion, which was down 3% year-on-year.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,2,Prepared remarks,Q3_2024,2024-10-11
"In Banking & Wealth Management, revenue was down 11% year-on-year, reflecting deposit margin compression and lower deposits, partially offset by growth in Wealth Management revenue. Average deposits were down 8% year-on-year and 2% sequentially.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,2,Prepared remarks,Q3_2024,2024-10-11
We're seeing a slowdown in customer yield-seeking activity including in CD volumes and expect deposits to be relatively flat for the remainder of the year.,quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,2,Prepared remarks,Q3_2024,2024-10-11
"Client investment assets were up 21% year-on-year driven by market performance, and we continue to see strong referrals of new wealth management clients from our branch network.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,2,Prepared remarks,Q3_2024,2024-10-11
"In Home Lending, revenue was up 3% year-on-year, driven by higher NII, partially offset by lower servicing and production revenue.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,2,Prepared remarks,Q3_2024,2024-10-11
"Turning to Card Services & Auto, revenue was up 11% year-on-year, driven by higher Card NII on higher revolving balances. Card outstandings were up 11% due to strong account acquisition and the continued normalization of revolve. And in Auto, originations were $10 billion, down 2%, while maintaining strong margins and high-quality credit.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,2,Prepared remarks,Q3_2024,2024-10-11
"Expenses of $9.6 billion were up 5% year-on-year, predominantly driven by higher field and technology compensation as well as growth in marketing.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,2,Prepared remarks,Q3_2024,2024-10-11
"In terms of credit performance this quarter, credit costs were $2.8 billion driven by Card, and reflected net charge-offs of $1.9 billion, up $520 million year-on-year, and a net reserve build of $876 million predominantly from higher revolving balances.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,2,Prepared remarks,Q3_2024,2024-10-11
"Next, the Commercial & Investment Bank on page 5. The CIB reported net income of $5.7 billion on revenue of $17 billion. IB fees were up 31% year-on-year and we ranked number one with year-to-date wallet share of 9.1%.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,2,Prepared remarks,Q3_2024,2024-10-11
"In Advisory, fees were up 10% benefiting from the closing of few large deals.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,2,Prepared remarks,Q3_2024,2024-10-11
"Underwriting fees were up meaningfully with debt up 56% and equity up 26%, primarily driven by favorable market conditions.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,3,Prepared remarks,Q3_2024,2024-10-11
"In light of the positive momentum throughout the year, we're optimistic about our pipeline, but the M&A regulatory environment and geopolitical situation are continued sources of uncertainty.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,3,Prepared remarks,Q3_2024,2024-10-11
"Payments revenue was $4.4 billion, up 4% year-on-year, driven by fee growth and higher deposit balances, largely offset by margin compression.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,3,Prepared remarks,Q3_2024,2024-10-11
"Moving to Markets. Total revenue was $7.2 billion, up 8% year-on-year. Fixed Income was flat reflecting outperformance in Currencies & Emerging Markets and lower revenue in Rates. Equities was up 27% reflecting strong performance across regions, largely driven by a supportive trading environment in the U.S. and increased late-quarter activity in Asia.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,3,Prepared remarks,Q3_2024,2024-10-11
"Securities Services revenue was $1.3 billion, up 9% year-on-year, largely driven by fee growth on higher market levels and volumes.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,3,Prepared remarks,Q3_2024,2024-10-11
"Expenses of $8.8 billion were down 1% year-on-year, with lower legal expense predominantly offset by higher revenue-related compensation and growth in employees, as well as higher technology spend.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,3,Prepared remarks,Q3_2024,2024-10-11
Average Banking & Payments loans were down 2% year-on-year and down 1% sequentially. In the middle market and large corporate client segments we continue to see softness in both new loan demand and revolver utilization in part due to clients’ access to receptive capital markets.,quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,3,Prepared remarks,Q3_2024,2024-10-11
"In multi-family, while we are seeing encouraging signs in loan originations as long-term rates fall, we expect overall growth to remain muted in the near term as originations are offset by payoff activity.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,3,Prepared remarks,Q3_2024,2024-10-11
"Average client deposits were up 7% year-on-year and 3% sequentially, primarily driven by growth from large corporates in Payments and Securities Services.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,3,Prepared remarks,Q3_2024,2024-10-11
"Finally, credit costs were $316 million, driven by higher net lending activity, including in Markets, and downgrades, partially offset by improved macroeconomic variables.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,3,Prepared remarks,Q3_2024,2024-10-11
"Then to complete our lines of business, AWM on page 6. Asset & Wealth Management reported net income of $1.4 billion with pre-tax margin of 33%.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,3,Prepared remarks,Q3_2024,2024-10-11
"For the quarter, revenue of $5.4 billion was up 9% year-on-year, driven by growth in management fees on higher average market levels and strong net inflows, investment valuation gains compared to losses in the prior-year, and higher brokerage activity, partially offset by deposit margin compression.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,3,Prepared remarks,Q3_2024,2024-10-11
"Expenses of $3.6 billion were up 16% year-on-year, predominantly driven by higher compensation, including revenue-related compensation and continued growth in our private banking advisor teams as well as higher distribution fees and legal expense.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,3,Prepared remarks,Q3_2024,2024-10-11
"For the quarter, long-term net inflows were $72 billion, led by Fixed Income and Equities. And in liquidity, we saw net inflows of $34 billion.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,3,Prepared remarks,Q3_2024,2024-10-11
"AUM of $3.9 trillion and client assets of $5.7 trillion were both up 23%, [year-on-year] driven by higher market levels and continued net inflows. And finally, loans were up 2% quarter-on-quarter, and deposits were up 4% quarter-on-quarter.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,3,Prepared remarks,Q3_2024,2024-10-11
"Turning to Corporate on page 7. Corporate reported net income of $1.8 billion. Revenue was $3.1 billion, up $1.5 billion year-on-year.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,3,Prepared remarks,Q3_2024,2024-10-11
"NII was $2.9 billion, up $932 million year-on-year, predominantly driven by the impact of balance sheet mix and securities reinvestment, including from prior quarters.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,3,Prepared remarks,Q3_2024,2024-10-11
"NIR was a net gain of $155 million compared with a net loss of $425 million in the prior year, predominantly driven by lower net investment securities losses this quarter. Expenses of $589 million were down $107 million year-on-year.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,3,Prepared remarks,Q3_2024,2024-10-11
"To finish up, let's turn to the outlook on page 8. We now expect 2024 NII ex. Markets to be approximately $91.5 billion and total NII to be approximately $92.5 billion.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,3,Prepared remarks,Q3_2024,2024-10-11
"Our outlook for adjusted expense is now about $91.5 billion. And given where we are in the year, we included on the page, the implied fourth quarter guidance for NII and adjusted expense, and note, that the NII numbers imply about $800 million of Markets NII in the fourth quarter.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,3,Prepared remarks,Q3_2024,2024-10-11
"On credit, we continue to expect the 2024 Card net charge-off rate to be approximately 3.4%.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,3,Prepared remarks,Q3_2024,2024-10-11
"So, to wrap up, we're pleased with another quarter of strong operating performance. As we look ahead to the next few quarters, we expect results will be somewhat challenged as normalization continues, but we remain upbeat and focused on executing in order to continue delivering excellent returns through the cycle.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,3,Prepared remarks,Q3_2024,2024-10-11
"And with that, let's open the line for Q&A.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,3,Prepared remarks,Q3_2024,2024-10-11
Thank you. Please stand by. Our first question will come from the line of Jim Mitchell from Seaport Global Securities. You may proceed.,quarter,Operator,Host,3,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-11
"Hey, good morning. So, Jeremy, as you highlighted, full year NII guidance implies a sizable drop in Q4 NII ex. Markets about 6%. So, can you just maybe discuss what are the largest drivers of the sequential decline including any initial thoughts on deposit behavior and pricing since the 50 basis point cut?",quarter,Jim Mitchell,Analyst,4,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-11
"And since it's related, I'll just throw out my follow-up question. I realize the forward curve is moving around a lot, but since Dan brought it up a month ago, can you frame how you're thinking about the NII trajectory for 2025? Thanks.",quarter,Jim Mitchell,Analyst,4,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-11
"Yeah. Sure, Jim. I'll try to answer both questions together to the best of my ability. So, as we sit here today, the biggest single driver of the sequential decline is, in fact – that we're expecting – is, in fact, the yield curve. So, that yield curve has changed a little bit since Daniel made his comments at the conference earlier in the quarter, but not that significantly.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,4,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-11
"In terms of deposit balances, which is obviously another important factor here in light of the Fed starting the cutting cycle, it feels to us like right now, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks for Consumer, we're pretty much in the trough right now as we speak.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,4,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-11
"When you look at yield-seeking behavior that has come down quite a bit, so that's no longer as much of a headwind all else being equal. And then if you look at checking account balances, those have been pretty stable for some time, which we see as an indication that consumers are kind of done spending down their cash buffers. So that's kind of supportive for consumer deposit balances.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,4,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-11
"And in that context, the other relevant point is the CD mix where, with the rate cuts coming, we expect CD balances to price down with pretty high betas and probably the CD mix actually peaking around now.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,4,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-11
"And then as we move to Wholesale, we've actually already been seeing a little bit of growth there, and when you combine that with the sort of increasing view that many people in the market have that it's likely that the end of QT will be announced sometime soon, that's also a little bit supportive for deposit balances.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,4,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-11
"So, maybe, I'll – well, I guess then you also asked me a little bit about next year. So, I guess one thing to say, right, is that we did have a sequential increase in NII this quarter and, as you may recall, at Investor Day, I said that there was some chance that we would see sequential increases followed by sequential declines and that people should avoid kind of drawing the conclusion that we'd hit the trough when that happens. So that's essentially exactly what we're seeing now.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,4,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-11
"But from where we sit now, given the yield curve, assuming the yield curve materializes obviously, we do see a pretty clear picture of sequential declines in NII ex. Markets, but the trough may be happening sometime in the middle of next year, at which point the combination of balances, Card revolve growth and other factors can return us to sequential growth, obviously.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,4,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-11
"We're guessing it's pretty far out in the future, and we'll give you formal guidance on all this stuff next quarter, but I think that gives you a better framework to work with.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,4,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-11
All right. Thanks a lot.,quarter,Jim Mitchell,Analyst,4,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-11
Thanks.,quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,4,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-11
Thank you. Thank you. Next we will go to the line of Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research. You may proceed.,quarter,Operator,Host,4,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-11
"Hi. Good morning. So Jeremy, how are you? So I do want to ask on expenses, just in light of some of the comments that Daniel had made recently, just noting that consensus expense forecast for next year looked a little bit too light. I believe at the time it was just below $94 billion.",quarter,Steven Chubak,Analyst,5,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-11
"If we adjust for the one-timers this year, that would suggest a core expense base that's just below $90 billion, so pretty healthy step-up in expenses. I know you've always had a strong commitment and discipline around investment. Just want to better understand where those incremental dollars are being deployed and just which investments are being prioritized in particular looking out to next year.",quarter,Steven Chubak,Analyst,5,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-11
Sure. So good question and I agree with your numbers. I agree with the way you've normalized this year for the one-time type of significant items and also where the consensus was when Daniel made his comments.,quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,5,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-11
"And while we're at it, I would also just remind you on the NII comments at the time, the consensus for this year was $91.5 billion and for next year it was $90 billion so that was implying at the time a sequential decline of $1.5 billion. It was because we felt that decline wasn't big enough that we made the comments that we made. So happy to expand more on that, but anyway.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,5,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-11
"To expenses. Yeah. So if you start for the sake of argument with a base of $90 billion, obviously, inflation is normalizing and obviously we're always trying to generate efficiencies to offset inflation. But, that having been said, if you assume 3% for the sake of argument on that base, that's a few billion dollars right out of the gates that we're working against. So that's one thing.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,5,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-11
"The other thing is that we have continued to execute on our growth strategies this year so there's a not insignificant amount of annualization. You can't quite see that in the fourth quarter numbers because of the seasonality of incentive comp., but if you were to strip that out, you would see probably some sequential increases and so annualization as an additional headwind.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,5,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-11
"The other thing that's worth noting is that we do expect fees and volume-related businesses to grow next year. And so all else being equal, that would come with a higher expense loading. So when you assemble all of those, that goes a long way to explain why sort of that consensus number that is slightly below $94 billion just seemed light.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,5,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-11
"In terms of priorities and investments, really nothing has changed, like the strategy hasn't changed. The strategy hasn't changed and the plans haven't changed and we're just kind of executing with the same long-term perspective that we've always had.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,5,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-11
"I would note that relative to NII, obviously, we're in the third quarter now, not the fourth quarter. And in the old days, we did used to give you the guidance until Investor Day in late February. So we will give you formal expense guidance next quarter for both, well, for expenses and NII next quarter. But especially on expenses, we are in the middle of the budget cycle right now so we probably have a little less visibility there than we do at the margin on NII.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,5,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-11
"And can I just give you just a view of expense a little bit? What you call expenses very often I call investments. If you actually go back to Investor Day, you'll see that we're adding private bankers in Asset & Wealth Management, we're adding ETF in Asset & Wealth Management, we're adding private bankers in international Private Banking. We're growing Chase Wealth Management. We've added some branches across the United States of America. We think there are huge opportunities for Innovation Economy that takes bankers and certain technology, stuff like that.",quarter,Jamie Dimon,CEO,5,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-11
"Our goal is to gain share and everything we do, we get really good returns on it. So I look at that, these are opportunities for us. These are not expenses that we have to actually punish ourself on. And we do get, and we show you kind of extensively cost and productivity on various things. And also AI is going to go up a little bit and I would put that as a category that just is going to generate great stuff over time.",quarter,Jamie Dimon,CEO,5,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-11
"Thank you both for the color. Just a quick follow-up for me, just drilling down into NII. It appears you redeployed a fair amount of cash or excess reserves at the Fed into securities. We saw the yield expand, which was encouraging, despite the pressure at both the long end and SOFR contraction in the quarter. I was hoping you could just speak to your appetite to extend duration in this environment.",quarter,Steven Chubak,Analyst,5,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-11
I know that you've had some aversion to that in the past. But do you anticipate redeploying additional excess liquidity just amid the expectation for deeper rate cuts?,quarter,Steven Chubak,Analyst,6,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-11
"Yeah. Sure. So on extending duration, Steve, you know this obviously, but I just think it's important to say that all else equal, extending duration doesn't change expected NII if you assume that the policy rate follows the forward, right? So, point one.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,6,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-11
"Point two, the curve remains inverted. And so even if you don't believe that the policy rate follows the forwards, extending right now is actually a headwind to short-term NII like that wouldn't be a consideration for us either way, but I just think that's worth saying for the broader audience. It's quite different from the situation that you have on the numbers...",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,6,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-11
"... people have mortgages at 6%, so, right.",quarter,Jamie Dimon,CEO,6,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-11
"Yeah. Now so when we think of the question of extending duration and really managing duration right now, a couple things to say. So, obviously, a lot of different versions of duration, but one number that we disclose is the EaR. When the 10-Q comes out, you'll see that that number is a little bit lower. It'll come down from $2.8 billion to about $2.1 billion if our current estimates are correct. That's for a number of reasons, some of which are passive, but some of those are active choices to extend duration a little bit.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,6,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-11
"And in the end, the choice to manage and extend duration is really about balancing the volatility of NII against protecting the company from extreme scenarios on either side. And so right now, if we wanted to extend as a result of different factors, we certainly could. We have the capacity inside the portfolio. But for now, we're comfortable with where we are.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,6,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-11
And the one thing I can assure you is the forward curve will not be the same forward curve in six months.,quarter,Jamie Dimon,CEO,6,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-11
"Well said. Well, thank you so much for taking my questions.",quarter,Steven Chubak,Analyst,6,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-11
"Thanks, Steve.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,6,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-11
Thank you. Next we will go to the line of Erika Najarian from UBS. You may proceed.,quarter,Operator,Host,6,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-11
"My first question, and thank you very much for answering all the NII questions so far, Jeremy, is just I guess another follow-up. As you can imagine, once Daniel said what he said on stage in September, everyone is trying to figure out the over/under for net interest income next year. So maybe a two-part first question, the second being inspired by what Jamie just said.",quarter,Erika Najarian,Analyst,6,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-11
"Number one, NII is expected to be down 6% sequentially in fourth quarter. I think year-over-year in 2025, consensus has it down 4% from your new level. So it sounds like consensus still has room to come down, and based on the forward curve, Jeremy, it could be a little bit worse year-over-year than the fourth quarter sequential rate.",quarter,Erika Najarian,Analyst,7,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-11
"But that being said, as Jamie noted, we have no idea what the curve is going to look like. Right? It's gyrated so much. And so as we think about the curve, is it better for JPMorgan to have more cuts in the short end but steepness or less cuts but a little bit of a flatter curve?",quarter,Erika Najarian,Analyst,7,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-11
"Right. Okay. You threw a curve ball at the end there, Erika. I wasn't expecting that to be the end of your question. But let me answer the beginning of your question, and then I'll also answer the end of your question.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,7,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-11
"So we see the current 2025 consensus for NII ex. Markets to be currently at $87 billion, which is obviously lower than it was at the conference earlier in the quarter. So we're happy to see that move a little bit more in line to us. That still looks a little toppy, but it's definitely in the ballpark.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,7,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-11
"Now that consists of, I already mentioned previously that we sort of expect the NII trough sometime in the middle of the year, so you can kind of assemble the parts. You've got a fourth quarter run rate, you've got some sequential declines, you've got a trough in the middle of the year, and you've got a rough ballpark for the full year.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,7,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-11
"So you can imagine that the trough probably is a little lower than those numbers and then to the extent that growth revolve resumes in the back half of the year in both deposit balances and the ongoing tailwind of Card revolve, although that tailwind will be a little bit less than you might have otherwise thought. I mean, sorry. A little bit less than it was this year but still a tailwind.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,7,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-11
"Obviously, the mix of those things will play out in different ways, and as you point out, who knows what the yield curve will wind up doing. But on our current assumptions, on the current yield curve, and remembering that we're in the third quarter now, so we're doing this kind of early, that's what we think.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,7,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-11
"Can I just say something. First of all, next time let's just give them the damn number. I don't want to spend all the time on these calls like going through what they're guessing what NII is going to be next year.",quarter,Jamie Dimon,CEO,7,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-11
"Can I just also point out that NII, all things being equal, is a number, but all things are never equal. And the yield curve, if you have a recession the effect of the yield curve will be very different than if you have continued growth. And there are decisions that are made nonstop by us and the things that happen in the marketplace, and I think we spend too much time on just this irrelevancy so you get a model, a number in your model. And so it's going to be less than $87 billion next year. Probably not a lot, we don't know, and we don't know the environment.",quarter,Jamie Dimon,CEO,7,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-11
"Good. Okay. Now to your question about the EaR. So, a few things to say in there. So, as I already mentioned, when that comes out, it'll show a number around $2.1 billion. A very important thing to say is, as you know, the experience of this rate cycle has been that our empirical EaR is meaningfully higher than our modeled EaR, which is what we disclose. And the main reason for that is that retail deposit betas have, in actuality, been lower than the modeled deposit betas.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,7,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-11
"So as a starting point, you have to kind of adjust that EaR number to be bigger than the reported number for those and a few other reasons, actually, there's some nuances around how the dollar, non-dollar sensitivity interact. And then there's your question which is a little bit about the front-end versus the back-end.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,7,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-11
"So, what you see is that actually the front-end EaR has gotten smaller and most of the EaR is now in the back-end. So, it's definitely the case that, all else being equal, a steeper curve is better for us. But I think what I would also say is that this kind of empirical versus theoretical adjustment is disproportionately in the front-end. So therefore, in order to answer your question, I would say, yes, we want a steeper curve, but having the Fed cut more than what's currently in the yield curve is definitely at the margin, for the context of next year's numbers a headwind – would be a headwind for us, we remain asset sensitive to Fed cuts.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,7,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-11
"And if I can ask my second question, and, Jamie, I completely understand your frustration. And to be fair, your long-term shareholders really don't care about whether it's $87 billion or $85 billion. Right? They care about your return on equity. To that end, I mean, it's insane how much capital you generate each quarter, 72 basis points this quarter.",quarter,Erika Najarian,Analyst,8,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-11
"And so, beyond the standard boilerplate questions you're going to get on buyback and organic growth, yada, yada, dividend increases, how should we think about JPMorgan deploying this capital? I mean, the world is generally your oyster, right? You're dominant already, and you could use this capital to further enhance your business.",quarter,Erika Najarian,Analyst,8,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-11
"And again, beyond that boilerplate conversation that you always get every quarter, how should your shareholders think about how you're thinking about the opportunities to deploy this capital?",quarter,Erika Najarian,Analyst,8,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-11
"Okay. First of all, when you say dominant, I'd be very careful on that. We've got some very tough competition, different in different countries, different around the world, fintech companies, direct lenders and I want to give you a very specific comment on direct lending and stuff like that. So our goal is always to serve our clients. And when I talk about some of these expenses, that is a deployment of capital, and it's a deployment in a different way.",quarter,Jamie Dimon,CEO,8,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-11
"If you open branches, you initially experience an expense, but down the road you need capital to support the deposits. Same for the Innovation Economy, same for private bankers, et cetera. If you look at it roughly, we have about a minimum $30 billion of excess capital. And for me, it's not burning a hole in my pocket. I look at it as you own the whole company and you can't properly deploy it now, it is perfectly reasonable to wait. And I've been quite clear that I think the future could be quite turbulent. And asset prices, in my view, in life you've got to take a view sometimes, are inflated. I don't know if they're extremely inflated or a little bit, but I prefer to wait.",quarter,Jamie Dimon,CEO,8,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-11
"We will be able to deploy it. Our shareholders will be very well served by us waiting. And same thing with deploying capital. We can go buy $100 billion, 6% mortgages, increase our net income by a couple billion tomorrow. We don't make decisions like that. The most important thing we do is serve our clients well, build the technology and do things like that. And we also don’t know what the real excess capital is yet. So, we're a little patient. We're going to be a little patient and wait, and it'll be fine.",quarter,Jamie Dimon,CEO,8,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-11
"And so that's where we are, and that's not going to change. And if it changes, we'll let you know. We do talk to a lot of shareholders, and they understand that buying stock back at more than two times tangible book value is not necessarily the best thing to do, because we think we'll have better opportunities to redeploy it or to buy back at cheaper prices at one point. Markets do not stay high forever.",quarter,Jamie Dimon,CEO,8,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-11
Thank you.,quarter,Erika Najarian,Analyst,8,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-11
"One last thing. Cash is a very valuable asset sometimes in a turbulent world. And you see my friend Warren Buffett stockpiling cash right now. I mean, people should be a little more thoughtful about how we're trying to navigate in this world and grow for the long term for our company.",quarter,Jamie Dimon,CEO,8,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-11
Thank you. Our next question comes from Glenn Schorr from Evercore ISI. You may proceed.,quarter,Operator,Host,8,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-11
Hi. Thanks very much. And so glad Jamie didn't say what he was about to say because that's the answer to this question.,quarter,Glenn Schorr,Analyst,8,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-11
"So we've seen a couple more banks entering partnerships with alternative managers. We've seen limited loan growth for a few years now, market-related also; limited flows into fixed income funds, yet plenty of growth in private credit in general. And you're one of the best asset managers on the planet, but in my view, less dominant in all things private credit.",quarter,Glenn Schorr,Analyst,8,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-11
"So maybe you could talk about what things you're working on and why that's too narrow of a view of your ability to serve all parts of clients’ lending needs, not just the public markets and public lending side. Thanks.",quarter,Glenn Schorr,Analyst,9,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-11
"Yeah. So let me take time to cover this one, because obviously it has become very important. People talking about how they're growing and partnering and things like that.",quarter,Jamie Dimon,CEO,9,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-11
"And so first and foremost – I’m going to talk about very strategic and then very tactical, I think they're both important. First and foremost, we are here to give our clients an agnostic view of the world and what the best product and services are for them. Therefore, when a client comes in, we will offer them both direct lending, ourselves, and syndicated lending or other specialized kind of lending. And they all have pluses and minuses.",quarter,Jamie Dimon,CEO,9,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-11
"Direct lending could be done faster, maybe simpler covenants, unitranche. It is more expensive and you're just seeing a little things go back and forth between syndicated lending and direct lending. But we're going to offer the clients basically what's in their best interest and tell them what those products are across the venue.",quarter,Jamie Dimon,CEO,9,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-11
"We mentioned before in the past that we allocated $10 billion of capital to make direct loans. We've actually deployed a lot of capital. Some of those have already been paid off, some of it’s done. So we are going to do it directly and we are going to – $10 billion could be $20 billion or $30 billion, not limiting it today. I will say today, we're extending. We will do $500 million, we will do $1 billion, we will do more than $1 billion, we'll do it sole-handed or we'll do it with partners.",quarter,Jamie Dimon,CEO,9,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-11
"Very importantly, we are not going to allocate ourselves to one partner. So we have – I think we've announced a bunch of co-lenders, but that just creates more flexibility and more size. We're not going to use that flexibility to slow it down and have to get permission from everybody, because like I said, JPMorgan could underwrite it and own it like a bridge loan and syndicate it after the fact. And we're going to use our own risk measures and stuff like that, again, all in the service of the client and making sure we're offering them the best thing.",quarter,Jamie Dimon,CEO,9,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-11
"And we're going with different strategies. We're not going to tie ourselves exclusively to one capital provider. I think that would limit what we could offer our clients, it probably would be more price competitive. We could do some of this very specific thing and not the solution that this is the third-party capital provider. That's our strategy. We're going to be there, we're going to do it, and we're going to do it in spite of the fact there's capital arbitrage taking place.",quarter,Jamie Dimon,CEO,9,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-11
"So if you look at the arbitrage today, where a bank has to hold for things, where insurance could, they are dramatically different. That's a disadvantage, but we've had those disadvantages in other businesses for a long time. We are going to do what's right for the client. Remember, when we do business with a client, we also get other revenues off of them. So it isn't just the loan; we look at the whole relationship. So we're quite comfortable we can compete. I just announced much bigger lending platforms and sizes and stuff like that, so I hope if any of the press is on they heard this too.",quarter,Jamie Dimon,CEO,9,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-11
All right. Thanks for all that.,quarter,Glenn Schorr,Analyst,9,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-11
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.,quarter,Operator,Host,9,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-11
"Good morning, Jeremy, and good morning, Jamie. Jeremy, when you guys look at your current capital ratios, they are obviously very healthy. Can you guys give us some color on the new Basel III? We don't know what the specifics are, but as Vice Chair Barr touched on some of the specifics, it looks like capital requirements for yourself and your peers will come down a fair amount from the original proposal.",quarter,Gerard Cassidy,Analyst,9,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-11
How are you guys thinking about that? Do you have any insights on how much it may fall from the original proposal to where you are today?,quarter,Gerard Cassidy,Analyst,9,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-11
"Yeah. When I said we're at $30 billion of excess, that is assuming Barr's speech, that the 20% goes to 12% or whatever it is, more. It'll be more than that because there are other factors involved. Now, I was just giving the minimum of excess capital. In my view, it would be more, but it is what it is and we'll wait to see the final numbers.",quarter,Jamie Dimon,CEO,10,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-11
"But, Gerard, just maybe to give you a bit of color. So, yeah. Obviously, everyone paid a lot of attention to that speech. It was an important speech. But in the end, we actually just really need to see the proposal because the details matter a lot for this stuff. And so our focus is on hoping to see the proposal so that we can process the detail and continue advocating as appropriate.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,10,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-11
"I note that you talk about requirements coming down relative to what was originally proposed which was obviously true per the speech, but I do think we need to be a little bit careful not to fall into the trap of saying that that's like progress just because the original proposal was so dramatically higher than what anyone thought was reasonable. And I would remind you, which you obviously know, that before this proposal came out, it was our position strongly felt, that our then-prevailing capital requirements were, if anything, already more than we needed.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,10,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-11
"So we've got a long way to go here, and I think our position, which Jamie has been articulating very consistently, is that they need to get it right with the right amount of work, and importantly, do it holistically so it's not just RWA. It's RWA, it's G-SIB, it's SCB, it's CCAR. So that's really what we feel strongly about.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,10,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-11
"We just want the numbers to be done right and justified. If they had to go up, we would be fine with that too. We just think they should be done with real diligence and real thought and a little bit of thought about cost benefit, what it does to the economy, where it pushes lending and things like that. So we're anxiously awaiting to see the actual detail, because that's what's going to make all the difference.",quarter,Jamie Dimon,CEO,10,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-11
"Very good. And then as a follow-up, in view of this excess capital and your comments a moment ago about direct lending, you look at your current cash and marketable securities on a risk-weighted asset basis, you put it in your presentation of course, $1.5 trillion. Average loans is $1.3 trillion. When the dust settles, you know what your capital requirements are. Can you frame out for us, levering up the excess capital with more loans, is that a path that might be considered over the next two or three years relative to where you are on a mix basis? I know you're going to grow your loans, but I'm talking about the mix.",quarter,Gerard Cassidy,Analyst,10,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-11
"Absolutely, positively not. Loans are an outcome of doing good business. We want to do good business. If it grows our balance sheet, we're fine.",quarter,Jamie Dimon,CEO,10,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-11
"And I do think, Gerard, it depends a lot on what type of loans you're talking about, right? So I think in the end, as Jamie says, like it's capital. We're going to deploy it ideally to grow the franchise organically, and that could include loans that are almost good loans on a stand-alone basis, as well as loans that are part of an overall relationship, what we're getting other revenue as part of that. So it's the same strategy that we've always had, but I wouldn't think of it as like excess capital to be deployed against a particular product. I would think of it as it's there for a rainy day. Let's hope the environment doesn't deteriorate a lot, but if it does, we'll be ready. And there will be opportunities hopefully to deploy it against a client franchise or against a stock. And if not, we'll return it. But not now.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,10,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-11
"Very good. Appreciate the color and candor, as always. Thank you.",quarter,Gerard Cassidy,Analyst,11,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-11
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. You may proceed.,quarter,Operator,Host,11,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-11
"Good morning. So lower rates was supposed to drive a pick-up in loan growth and conversion of some of these investment banking pipelines. Obviously, we just had one cut and it's early. But any beginning signs of this in terms of the interest in borrowing more, and again, conversion of the banking pipelines?",quarter,Matt O'Connor,Analyst,11,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-11
"I would say, Matt, generally no, frankly, with a couple of minor exceptions. So I think it's probably fair to say that the outperformance late in the quarter in investment banking fees was to a meaningful degree, as I mentioned, driven by DCM as well as to some degree driven by the acceleration of the closing of some M&A transactions. And I do think that some of that DCM outperformance is in the sort of types of deals that are opportunistic deals that aren't in our pipeline, and those are often driven by treasurers and CFOs sort of seeing improvement in market levels and jumping on those. So it's possible that that's a little bit of a consequence of the cuts.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,11,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-11
"As I think I mentioned we did see, for example, a pick-up in mortgage applications and a tiny bit of pick-up in refi. And our multi-family lending business, there might be some hints of more activity there. But these cuts were very heavily priced. Right? The curve has been inverted for a long time. So to a large degree, this is expected. So it's not obvious to me that you should expect immediate dramatic reactions, and that's not really what we're seeing.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,11,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-11
"Yeah. And also in the debt markets, rates came down, spreads are quite low, and markets are wide open. So it kind of makes sense that people are taking advantage of that today. Those conditions may not prevail, be the ongoing conditions late next year.",quarter,Jamie Dimon,CEO,11,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-11
"And then specifically in the debit and credit card spend that you guys break out, you had nice growth year-over-year, up 6%, flat quarter-over-quarter, I know there's a lot of seasonality 2Q to 3Q. I think last year, it was up about 1%. But are you seeing any kind of changes in the consumer spend either the mix or some signs of a slowdown later in the quarter? Thank you.",quarter,Matt O'Connor,Analyst,11,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-11
"So I think what there is to say about consumer spend is a little bit boring in a sense because what's happened is that it's become normal, so meaning – I mean, I think we're getting to the point where it no longer makes sense to talk about the pandemic, but maybe one last time. One of the things that you had was that heavy rotation into T&E as people did a lot of traveling and they booked cruises that they hadn't done before, and everyone was going out to dinner a lot, whatever. So you had the big spike in T&E, the big rotation into discretionary spending, and that's now normalized. And you would normally think that rotation out of discretionary into nondiscretionary would be a sign of consumers battening down the hatches and getting ready for a much worse environment. But given the levels that it started from, what we see it as is actually like normalization. And inside that data, we're not seeing weakening, for example, in retail spending.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,11,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-11
"So overall, we see the spending patterns as being sort of solid and consistent with the narrative that the consumer is on solid footing and consistent with the strong labor market and the current central case of a kind of no-landing scenario economically. But obviously, as we always point out, that's one scenario and there are many other scenarios.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,11,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-11
Got it. Thank you.,quarter,Matt O'Connor,Analyst,12,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-11
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo from Wells Fargo Securities. You may proceed.,quarter,Operator,Host,12,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-11
"Hey. Jamie, I think I've seen you comment on government this year more than any other time in your career. And the August 2 op-ed, Washington Post, Davos you're talking about government. I think it was this week or last week on Bloomberg, you're saying bank mergers should be allowed. Your bus tour in August, you were asked, which is my question now, under what circumstances would you leave for government service and your answer then was “I love what I do.” We get it you love what you do. But under what circumstances would you consider government service? It seems like you'd be more likely to go now than in the past just based on the numerous comments that you've made. Is that right, wrong, what's your thinking?",quarter,Mike Mayo,Analyst,12,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-11
"I think it's wrong. I've always been an American patriot. My country is more important to me than my company, and I think this government is very important to get this – and if you look at the world today, Mike, it is so important that we get things right for the whole geopolitical world. I'm not just talking about the American economy, and we try to participate in policy at the local level, at the state level, at the federal level, at the international level to try to help. That's our job. We try to grow economies and things like that. So nothing has changed in my view, my opinion, or my interest. I just think it's very, very important that we try to help the government do a good job.",quarter,Jamie Dimon,CEO,12,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-11
"So if you were asked by the next administration to serve the country, would you be open to considering it?",quarter,Mike Mayo,Analyst,12,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-11
"I think the chance of that is almost nil and I probably am not going to do it, but I've always reserved the right. I don't make promise to people. I don't have to. But no, I love what I do. I intend to be doing what I'm doing. I almost guarantee I'll be doing this for a long period of time or at least until the board kicks me out.",quarter,Jamie Dimon,CEO,12,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-11
"Let me take the flip side of that question for those of you who are worried about you leaving. The other side of the question is we were on these calls the last couple of years. You're saying the stock is over-valued, and I think that's what you're saying. You're saying the stock market is over-valued and therefore all stocks are over-valued. And on the one hand, you guys, you highlight on this call AI, tech, market share gains, high returns, high capital. So, do you think in some ways when we think about the value of your price, and your ability to do buybacks, you're thinking more about an old school model for valuing your stock as opposed to a new school model that might put you in the category of more tech-oriented firms, especially as it relates to your progress with AI.",quarter,Mike Mayo,Analyst,12,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-11
"Listen, you're making a very good point, which is I think we have an exceptional company, exceptional franchises, and the price point at which you might buy the stock. But I'm not that exuberant about thinking even tech valuations or any valuations will stay at these very inflated values. And so I'm just – we're just quite patient in that, and I think you're going to have to judge us over time about whether we're done the right thing to do nothing. And remember, we could always do it. We haven't lost the money. It didn't go away. It's sitting in store. The only time that would be really wrong is if the stock runs way up, we've got to buy at much higher prices. And I just, I would be a real skeptic about that happening.",quarter,Jamie Dimon,CEO,12,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-11
Thank you. Our next question comes from Ebrahim Poonawala from Bank of America. Your line is open.,quarter,Operator,Host,13,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-11
"Yeah, good morning. I guess just wanted to follow-up. You talked about private credit and the disruption to bank lending. Another area I would appreciate if you can address is we've been hearing a lot about the likes of Jane Street and other market makers potentially disrupting fixed income trading. Is that a real risk? And is there an opportunity for a firm like JPMorgan to actually compete on the private venue side on market making beyond traditional sort of FICC activity?",quarter,Ebrahim H. Poonawala,Analyst,13,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-11
"Yeah, Ebrahim, the way I would frame that is not as a risk but as a reality. We've always emphasized in all of our businesses that we operate in an extremely competitive environment, and that applies to – and that competitive environment isn't limited to competing against banks or traditional financial institutions. It extends in the consumer space to fintechs. And in the market making space, it obviously increasingly is extending to some of the types of firms that you're referring to.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,13,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-11
"Now those firms are, in many cases, also clients. And that's the same type of dynamic that you see, for example, in the private credit space that we've discussed before. So there's no question that the ecosystem is changing. You've got new competitors. You've got changes in market structure, new dynamics. And as with any business, we are innovating and adjusting and making sure that we're prepared to compete in all the traditional ways and all the new ways.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,13,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-11
"Of course, there are some ways in which being a bank hinders our ability to do that. And one of the arguments that we've made going back to the capital and liquidity regulations is that when you come to the impact on the kind of U.S. capital markets ecosystem, which is the end view of the world, its worked well in its current construct for a long time where some activities were inside the regulated perimeter and there was robust participation from unregulated capital of various sorts. And a world where more and more of that activity gets pushed outside of bank market makers is a meaningful change to that structure that is untested, and it's unclear why you would want that. And we've cautioned that if that's the intent of the regulations, it should be intentional and well-studied. But in the meantime, we're going to adjust and compete to the best of our ability given the constraints of the current rule set.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,13,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-11
"The previous answer on the private markets, it remains to be seen how that develops. There is a little bit of that, and some people are talking about making more active things in private markets. In some ways we're well-positioned for that too, because for that you need liquidity, market-making valuation, buyers and sellers on both sides to create liquidity. So that hasn't developed yet, but we may have competition, but we'll be there when the time comes.",quarter,Jamie Dimon,CEO,13,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-11
"And the second one is the public markets. You have seen reports about you have deal inventories, both corporate and treasuries. And I do think that's capital. But again, we do it, remember, for clients. So we are large market makers on both sides of the markets for clients in both credit and treasuries, which is a little different than some of the other people just trading for their own account. And so they are both competition from our standpoint, but we're there. We're going to do it. We're can always deploy more capital if we want. And we would even deploy more capital at lower returns if we really had to do that to service clients. So we're very conscious of it. There will be competition both sides. As Jeremy said, we sat here 10 years ago talking about the electronification of the business and can we keep up with that, and so far we have.",quarter,Jamie Dimon,CEO,13,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-11
"Got it. And just one quick one. And, Jeremy, you, I think, mentioned QT stopping at some point. We saw the repo sort of market spike at the end of September. Give us your perspective on just the risk of market liquidity shock as we move into year-end and do you have a view on how quickly Fed should recalibrate QT or actually stop QT to prevent some loss? Thanks.",quarter,Ebrahim H. Poonawala,Analyst,13,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-11
"Yeah. It's a good question, Ebrahim. But I think you've kind of answered your own question. In other words, like the argument out there is that the repo spike that we saw at the end of this quarter was an indication that maybe the market is approaching that lowest comfortable level of reserves that's been heavily speculated about. And recognizing that that number is probably higher and driven by the evolution of firm's liquidity requirements as opposed to some of the more traditional measures.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,14,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-11
"And side point, it's just another reason why it's important to look at the whole framework holistically when we think about the regulatory response of the events of two springs ago. You don't want those types of spikes and it raises some questions about why there isn't more readiness to deploy into those types of disruptions, albeit this one was relatively minor.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,14,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-11
"But in any case, when you put all that together, it would seem to add some weight to the notion that maybe QT should be wound down and that seems to be increasingly the consensus that that's going to get announced at some point in the fourth quarter. So my only point was if you play that view through, it's a residual headwind for system-wide deposit growth which gets removed. And that's one of the reasons that we feel that we're probably in the trough of our deposit balances at the level of...",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,14,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-11
"So I just want to add a couple policy things here. I'm not actually sure they can actually do that, because you have inflationary factors out there, partially driven by QE. And also, look at the volatility. It's not a risk to JPMorgan. It's a risk to the system. And what banks have, I already mentioned the constrained balance sheet a little bit. So the banks will have trillions of dollars of cash and unable to deploy the repo markets. And is it a good policy thing that every time that happens, because you can do it very safely, fully collateralized, all things like that, providing what I call flexible financing in the marketplace, that that happens, the Fed has to step in every time? I think that becomes a policy issue that every time there's some kind of fluctuation in the market, people panic and the Fed has got to step in and provide stuff. And can they always do that if you have a slightly more inflationary environment going forward?",quarter,Jamie Dimon,CEO,14,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-11
"So I think you've got to be very thoughtful about this and that's why we do think they should look at calibrating SLR and ECLR and CET1, all of these things, particularly for this. So my view is, it is going to happen again. I can't tell you exactly when, but I'd be surprised if it doesn't happen again.",quarter,Jamie Dimon,CEO,14,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-11
Got it. Thank you both.,quarter,Ebrahim H. Poonawala,Analyst,14,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-11
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.,quarter,Operator,Host,14,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-11
"Oh, hi. Good morning.",quarter,Betsy L. Graseck,Analyst,14,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-11
"Hey, Betsy.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,14,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-11
Can you hear me? Hello?,quarter,Betsy L. Graseck,Analyst,14,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-11
Yeah.,quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,15,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-11
Can you hear me okay?,quarter,Betsy L. Graseck,Analyst,15,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-11
Yeah. We can hear you. Can you hear us?,quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,15,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-11
"Oh, yes. Thank you. So one for Jeremy, one for Jamie. Jeremy and Jamie, Sorry about the NII question I'm going to have, but it is more than half your revenue so I kind of care about it.",quarter,Betsy L. Graseck,Analyst,15,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-11
"But when I'm thinking about the trough and then the build-up, QT ending, deposit growth, I mean, that's part of the calculation for improvement as we go into 2025. Right? I should embed that outlook. Is that right? And that's embedded in how you're thinking about it. I know we don't have a number for you for NII for 2025 but it is in there. Right?",quarter,Betsy L. Graseck,Analyst,15,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-11
"Yeah. In other words, it goes back to my prior point and to the point that I had in the prepared remarks about the consumer deposit balances in particular –",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,15,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-11
Right.,quarter,Betsy L. Graseck,Analyst,15,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-11
"– that there's lots of different offsetting factors right now, right. You've got the yield curve, you've got Card revolve, you've got balances. And balances have been a headwind. We now see it as neutral and they could potentially become a tailwind later in the year. And one of the potential reasons for that is – one of the potential reasons for that is the potential end of QT, but emphasize the word potential, to Jamie's point.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,15,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-11
"You also obviously have a little bit of the fixed asset, fixed-rate asset reprice dynamics starting to flow through a little bit. While we're on NII, just to annoy Jamie a little bit more, I do want to make a point that I didn't get a chance to make previously, which is there's a reason that we emphasize the implied fourth quarter run rate for the Markets NII in the presentation which is that if you take that and you annualize it, it gives you a launch point run rate, which is significantly higher than what's currently in the consensus and obviously what we've seen this year. And I'll give you the concise version of my usual speech that changes in Markets NII are almost always bottom-line neutral and offset in NIR. But for the purposes of trying to help you guys with your models, I would just encourage you to recognize what that launch point is, the number of cuts that are in the curve, the fact that that number has historically and in the recent past has been quite liability-sensitive, so you can draw your own conclusions about what that should mean. Again, shouldn't change the overall revenue expectation. It's just a balance sheet and income statement geography issue. But just for the sake of helping you tidy up models, I wanted to make that point.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,15,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-11
And so Daniel's comments in September were on NII in total or NII ex. Markets? Could you just clarify that?,quarter,Betsy L. Graseck,Analyst,16,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-11
"No. Those were core NII or NII ex.. So again, reiterating at the time, the 2024 consensus was $91.5 billion. The 2025 consensus was $90 billion on NII ex. and our point was that that number, which remains an asset-sensitive number, indicated an insufficient amount of sequential decline year-on-year. The current consensus as we see it for NII ex. Markets is $87 billion. And as we've noted, that's closer albeit maybe still a little bit toppy.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,16,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-11
"Okay. Then one for Jamie. Jamie, we did talk already quite a bit about the capital that you have, capital in store. Just wanted to understand how you're thinking about that opportunity set that's in front of you with regard to using it for potentially portfolio acquisitions. I realize that depositories are not on the docket, but we all know there's portfolios out there that might be looking for a home. And could you give us a sense as to how interested you might be in acquiring assets at this stage?",quarter,Betsy L. Graseck,Analyst,16,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-11
"Yeah. So asset acquisitions, I mean I always want our people to be looking at those things and thinking about those things. But if you listen to what I'm saying about my caution about the world, it's hard for me to say that we're going to be in the market to buy credit assets.",quarter,Jamie Dimon,CEO,16,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-11
What about loans? The Apple card…,quarter,Betsy L. Graseck,Analyst,16,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-11
"But creating those assets to help clients. That's a whole different matter because when it comes to clients, we earn credit asset spread and we usually have other stuff. If our bankers can deploy capital that way, of course be that we want to do more. And our CIO could deploy capital in multiple ways, we would probably do more. And we ask all the time can we do more in affordable housing, can we do more in things we're actually quite comfortable. And yeah, if we could find ways to deploy capital, we would be happy to do that. But put us in your closest category...",quarter,Jamie Dimon,CEO,16,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-11
"And what about like a private label credit card, for example.",quarter,Betsy L. Graseck,Analyst,16,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-11
[indiscernible],quarter,Jamie Dimon,CEO,16,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-11
I'm just wondering about private label credit card for example. Is that something that would help clients?,quarter,Betsy L. Graseck,Analyst,16,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-11
Almost no chance.,quarter,Jamie Dimon,CEO,17,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-11
"Well, but having – it's very important. While I say that, I always tell the management team second-guess me. I mean, we’ve done private label. I know what it is, we've been there. I have a lot of issues with it. But is it possible it's going to be different one day and a different thing? Yeah, it's possible, so I don't want to cut it off. If Marianne Lake says to me, Jamie I think clearly the world's changed, we're going to change. But right now, we'd say no, there's no chance.",quarter,Jamie Dimon,CEO,17,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-11
Thank you so much.,quarter,Betsy L. Graseck,Analyst,17,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-11
Thank you. Our final question will come from Saul Martinez with HSBC. Your line is open.,quarter,Operator,Host,17,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-11
"Hey. Good morning. I'm not going to ask about a specific NII in 2025, but I did want to delve into the how to think about your deposit margin in volume dynamics in the CCB over the next few years. You have seen a decent amount of pressure in the deposit margin, 2.6%, down about 30 basis points as deposit balances have come down, so it put some pressure on deposit NII. But deposit margins are still well above where they were when rates were at levels that are consistent with where the forward curve now has been going. So I guess how do we think about both volumes and margin dynamics if rates do come down, say, to the level that are consistent with the forward curve? I know the forward curve is likely going to be long, but that's the reference point we have.",quarter,Saul Martinez,Analyst,17,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-11
"And conversely, volume offset. You mentioned, Jeremy, the retail deposits becoming a tailwind. But, I guess, how much of a tailwind could they be, especially as you are expecting to gain quite a bit of market share in retail deposits? So just give us a sense of sort of the push and pull of these dynamics that really help drive the deposit, the value of the deposit franchise.",quarter,Saul Martinez,Analyst,17,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-11
"Sure. Yeah, thanks for the question, Saul. And I think you've laid out the building blocks there already. Just for simplicity, I'm going to try to answer your question without referring to the disclosed CCB deposit margin number, just because that number is obviously the combination of the rate paid on the CCB deposits and the internal FTP into that. And that is a complicated thing that evolves as a function of the modeling of the betas and other things. So I think it's actually more helpful to look at this simply from a Firmwide perspective and look at the evolution of the rate paid in the context of the policy rates roughly, and just set aside the duration management and all those sort of factors.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,17,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-11
"And I think when you do that, what you see is we've been saying for a while that the deposit margin defined for these purposes is simply the difference between the policy rate and the weighted-average rate paid of the consumer deposits, was unsustainably high. And that was going to have to correct one way or the other. Either deposits were going to reprice at the product level through checking and savings, and/or we were going to see a ton of internal migration, i.e. growth in the CD mix, and/or we would see a lower policy rate. So as we sit here right now, of course, we make pricing decisions in the context of market competition at any given moment looking at what the environment is for deposits, but we have not needed to reprice in order to retain primary bank relationships which was also our core strategy. We were never going to chase sort of the hot money at the margin.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,17,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-11
"We've leaned in heavily to CDs and gotten to the current level of CD mix, and that's been a good strategy. And from where we sit now, we now have the margin coming down as a result of the policy rate coming down. It seems that, that puts us in a pretty comfortable position from a pricing perspective. We think the CD mix has probably peaked.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,17,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-11
"Now, on the way down, it's not going to go back down to zero, where it was at the beginning of the cycle. That's an important thing to realize. So all else equal, that creates a little bit of margin compression. And then through all of that, obviously, a lower yield environment should mean that there's a little bit less outflow from consumer deposits, as I mentioned. We're seeing a lot less yield-seeking behavior. So then when you overlay on to that what you mentioned, which is our long-term share growth in CCB deposits, in no small part as a function of the brand strategy and the buildout and the fact that only about a quarter of our top 125 markets in CCB are at that 15% share number, so we believe there's big opportunity to grow the rest of it and be on track at the type of average annual share growth of the order of 30 basis points or 40 basis points that we've seen historically. That's how you kind of assemble a tailwind from normalized deposit margin and balance growth in Consumer.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,18,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-11
"Jeremy, correct me if you think I'm wrong. The abnormal time period was when rates were between 0% and 1% or 2%. Other than that, if you're looking at, say, what are normal deposit margins in the normal banking business, forget people going after really hot money if that happens, it's 2% to 2.5%.",quarter,Jamie Dimon,CEO,18,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-11
"Absolutely. Yeah, we agree.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,18,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-11
"Okay. That's helpful. So it sounds like you're a little bit above that, but there's still some pressure. But you're not dramatically above those levels.",quarter,Saul Martinez,Analyst,18,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-11
"Very good returns in business in both Banking & Wealth Management. We're growing market share. And when we build branches and stuff like that, we don't necessarily assume current margins. We look at what would be normal margins over time. And we're very comfortable doing very nice business for you all.",quarter,Jamie Dimon,CEO,18,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-11
Yes. Got it. Okay. That's helpful. Thanks a lot. That's all I got.,quarter,Saul Martinez,Analyst,18,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-11
