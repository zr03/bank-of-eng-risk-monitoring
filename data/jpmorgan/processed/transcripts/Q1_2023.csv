We estimate that we have retained approximately $50 billion of these deposit inflows at quarter-end.,quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,2,Prepared remarks,Q1_2023,2023-04-14
"It's important to note that while the sequential period-end deposit increase is higher than we would have otherwise expected, our current full year NII outlook – which I will address at the end – still assumes modest deposit outflows from here.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,2,Prepared remarks,Q1_2023,2023-04-14

"This increase in guidance is primarily driven by lower rate paid assumptions across both consumer and wholesale in light of the expectation of Fed cuts later in the year, as well as slightly higher card revolving balances.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,4,Prepared remarks,Q1_2023,2023-04-14
"Note that in line with my comments at the outset, recent deposit balance increases are not a meaningful contributor to the upward revision in the NII outlook given that we expect a meaningful portion of the recent inflows to reverse later in the year.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,4,Prepared remarks,Q1_2023,2023-04-14
"I would point out that this outlook still embeds significant reprice lags: we think a more sustainable NII ex. Markets run-rate in the medium-term is well below this quarter's $84 billion, as well as below the $80 billion that is implied for the rest of the year by our full year guidance; and while we don't know exactly when this lower run-rate will be reached, when it happens, we believe it will be around the mid-70s.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,4,Prepared remarks,Q1_2023,2023-04-14
"And, of course, as we mentioned last quarter, this NII outlook remains highly sensitive to the uncertainty associated with the timing and the extent of deposit reprice, investment portfolio decisions, the dynamics of QT and RRP, the trajectory of Fed funds, as well as the broader macroeconomic environment – including its impact on loan growth.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,4,Prepared remarks,Q1_2023,2023-04-14
"Separately, it's worth noting that Markets NII may start to trend slightly positive towards the end of the year as a function of mix and rate effects.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,4,Prepared remarks,Q1_2023,2023-04-14
"Moving to expenses, our outlook for 2023 continues to be about $81 billion.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,4,Prepared remarks,Q1_2023,2023-04-14
"Importantly, this does not currently include the impact of the pending FDIC special assessment.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,4,Prepared remarks,Q1_2023,2023-04-14
"And on credit, we continue to expect the 2023 Card net charge-off rate to be approximately 2.6%.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,4,Prepared remarks,Q1_2023,2023-04-14
"So to wrap up, our strong results this quarter once again highlight the earnings power of this diversified franchise.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,4,Prepared remarks,Q1_2023,2023-04-14
"We have benefited from our fortress principles and commitment to invest, which we will continue to do as we head into an increasingly uncertain environment.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,4,Prepared remarks,Q1_2023,2023-04-14

"Hey, good morning.",quarter,Steven Chubak,Analyst,4,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-14
"Good morning, Steve.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,4,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-14
"So, Jamie, I was actually hoping to get your perspective on how you see the recent developments with SVB impacting the regulatory landscape for the big banks.",quarter,Steven Chubak,Analyst,4,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-14
"In your letter you spent a fair amount of time highlighting the consequences of overly stringent capital requirements, the risk of steering more activities to the less regulated nonbanks.",quarter,Steven Chubak,Analyst,4,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-14
"But what are some of the changes that you're scenario planning for – whether it's higher capital, increase in FDIC assessment fees? And along those same lines, how you're thinking about the buyback given continued strong capital build, but a lot of macro uncertainty at the moment.",quarter,Steven Chubak,Analyst,4,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-14
"Well, I think you were already kind of complete with answering your own question there.",quarter,Jamie Dimon,CEO,4,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-14
"Look, we're hoping that everyone just takes a deep breath and looks at what happened and the breadth and depth of regulations already in place.",quarter,Jamie Dimon,CEO,4,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-14
"Obviously, when something happens like this, you should adjust, think about it.",quarter,Jamie Dimon,CEO,4,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-14
"So I think down the road there may be some limitations on held-to-maturity, maybe more TLAC for certain type-size banks, and more scrutiny on interest rate exposure, and stuff like that.",quarter,Jamie Dimon,CEO,4,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-14
"But it doesn't have to be a revamp of the whole system, just recalibrating things the right way.",quarter,Jamie Dimon,CEO,4,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-14
And I think it should be done knowing what you want the outcome to be.,quarter,Jamie Dimon,CEO,4,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-14
The outcome you should want is very strong community and regional banks.,quarter,Jamie Dimon,CEO,4,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-14
"And certain actions are taken which are drastic – it could actually make them weaker. So, that's all it is.",quarter,Jamie Dimon,CEO,4,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-14
"We do expect higher capital from Basel IV, effectively and, obviously there's going to be an FDIC assessment – that'll be what it is.",quarter,Jamie Dimon,CEO,4,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-14
"Got it. And just in terms of appetite for the buyback, just given some of the...",quarter,Steven Chubak,Analyst,5,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-14
"Oh, yeah.",quarter,Jamie Dimon,CEO,5,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-14
...elevated macro uncertainties.,quarter,Steven Chubak,Analyst,5,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-14
"Well, we've told you that we're kind of penciling in $12 billion for this year.",quarter,Jamie Dimon,CEO,5,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-14
"Obviously, capital is more than that, but – and we did a little bit of buyback this quarter. We're going to wait and see.",quarter,Jamie Dimon,CEO,5,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-14
"We don't mind keeping our powder dry, and you've seen us do that with investment portfolios, and we're also going to do that with capital.",quarter,Jamie Dimon,CEO,5,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-14
That's great. I'll hop back into the queue. Thanks so much for taking my questions.,quarter,Steven Chubak,Analyst,5,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-14
Okay.,quarter,Jamie Dimon,CEO,5,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-14
Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies. You may proceed.,quarter,Operator,Host,5,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-14
"Hey, thanks. Good morning. Hey, Jeremy, I was just wondering if you can just give us a little bit more detail on those lower funding expectation points that you made, just in terms of is it because of what you can offer the client that might allow you to kind of keep that beta lower?",quarter,Ken Usdin,Analyst,5,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-14
And maybe you can just kind of wrap it into what your overall beta expectations are in that revised update? Thank you.,quarter,Ken Usdin,Analyst,5,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-14
"Yeah, sure. So let me just summarize the drivers of the change in the outlook.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,5,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-14
"So the primary driver really is lower deposit rate paid expectations across both consumer and wholesale, which, as you mentioned, is driven by a couple factors.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,5,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-14
"So, the change in the rate environment, with cuts coming sooner in the outlook, all else equal, does take some pressure off the reprice.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,5,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-14
"And as you said, we're getting a lot of positive feedback from the field on our product offerings.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,5,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-14
"The short-term CD, in particular, is really getting a lot of positive feedback from our folks in the branches. It's been very attractive to yield-seeking customers. So that's kind of working well.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,5,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-14
"And then on the asset side, we are seeing a little bit higher Card revolve, which is helping.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,5,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-14
"And I'll just remind you that at a conference in February, I suggested that we were already starting to feel like some of the uncertainties we mentioned when giving the guidance had started all moving in the same direction, and that was one of the things that contributed to the upward revision, like all of the uncertainty kind of went the same way.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,5,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-14
"But as Jamie's pointed out – those uncertainties are all still there, we highlight them on the page, and as we look forward to this year and to next year and the medium-term we remain very focused on those.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,5,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-14
"Yeah, and as a follow-up on the point about rate expectations coming now in, and potentially getting cut sooner – how do you take a look at what that might mean just for the broader economy?",quarter,Ken Usdin,Analyst,6,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-14
Do you think it's more just because inflation's coming down? Do you think it's because the Fed's just got to react to an even tougher economy and still some of those storm clouds that might be out there?,quarter,Ken Usdin,Analyst,6,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-14
Just kind of your general thinking about the other read-throughs of what lower rates quicker will mean for the broader economy.,quarter,Ken Usdin,Analyst,6,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-14
"Well first of all, I don't quite believe it.",quarter,Jamie Dimon,CEO,6,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-14
"So the Fed has the rate curve, the forward short-term rate curve, almost at 1% higher than what the market has.",quarter,Jamie Dimon,CEO,6,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-14
"So one of the things you got to always prepare for is – it could be anything, we don't know what the rate curve is going to be in a year. And so we're quite cautious in that and quite thoughtful about that.",quarter,Jamie Dimon,CEO,6,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-14
"Obviously, the short-term read is higher recessionary risk and then inflation coming down.",quarter,Jamie Dimon,CEO,6,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-14
"So I think inflation will come down a little bit, but it could easily be stickier than people think and therefore, the rate curve will have to go up a little bit.",quarter,Jamie Dimon,CEO,6,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-14
Okay. Thank you very much.,quarter,Ken Usdin,Analyst,6,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-14
Thank you. The next question comes from the line of John McDonald with Autonomous Research. You may proceed.,quarter,Operator,Host,6,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-14
"Hi, thanks. Jeremy, wanted to follow up again on the drivers of the NII revision and the lower rates paid assumption.",quarter,John McDonald,Analyst,6,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-14
You mentioned the Fed cuts coming sooner and positive feedback on the customer offers.,quarter,John McDonald,Analyst,6,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-14
"What about the March events? Do the bank failures there that happened in March – in your view, do they slow the reprice intensity because folks are moving other than price reasons?",quarter,John McDonald,Analyst,6,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-14
Or they intensify it industry-wide because smaller banks have to reprice to keep their deposits? How do those events influence your view of the reprice?,quarter,John McDonald,Analyst,6,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-14
"Yeah. John, it's a really good question, and we've obviously thought about that.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,6,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-14
"But as we sit here today, I guess I have two answers to that.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,6,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-14
One is it's not meaningfully affecting our current outlook – we don't see it as a major driver.,quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,6,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-14
"And I think in terms of the larger dynamics that you lay out, it's just a little too early to tell. But from where we are right now, the base case is no real impact.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,6,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-14
"Okay. And then I wanted to ask Jamie – there's a narrative out there that the industry could see a credit crunch – banks are going to stop lending, even Jay Powell mentioned that as a risk.",quarter,John McDonald,Analyst,6,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-14
Do you see that in terms of anything you look at in terms of lending and is that a reaction that makes sense – that banks might be retrenching a lot here? Do you worry about that for the economy in terms of credit crunch? Thanks.,quarter,John McDonald,Analyst,6,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-14
Yeah. I wouldn't use the word credit crunch if I were you.,quarter,Jamie Dimon,CEO,6,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-14
"Obviously, there's going to be a little bit of tightening, and most of that will be around certain real estate things.",quarter,Jamie Dimon,CEO,6,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-14
"And you've heard it from real estate investors already, so I just look at that as a kind of thumb on the scale.",quarter,Jamie Dimon,CEO,6,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-14
"It just makes the Fed's conditions be a little bit tighter, it increases the odds of a recession – that's what that is. It's not like a credit crunch.",quarter,Jamie Dimon,CEO,6,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-14
Thank you. Our next question comes from Erika Najarian with UBS. You may proceed.,quarter,Operator,Host,6,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-14
Hi. Good morning. My first question is you mentioned that your reserve build was driven mostly by worse economic assumptions.,quarter,Erika Najarian,Analyst,7,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-14
I'm wondering if you could update us on what unemployment rate you're assuming in your reserve.,quarter,Erika Najarian,Analyst,7,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-14
"Yeah. So, Erika, as you know, we take – not going to go into a lot of detail here – but we take the outlook from our economists, we run a bunch of different scenarios and we probability-weight those.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,7,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-14
"The central case outlook from our research team hasn't actually changed, but we felt that in line with what Jamie just said in terms of a little bit of tightening as a result of the events of March, it made sense to add a little bit of weight to our relative adverse case.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,7,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-14
"So we did that, which changed the weighted-average expectation. And I think that the weighted-average peak unemployment that we're using now is something like 5.8%.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,7,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-14
"So, as you think about all of what you've just told us – so $81 billion of NII this year, and who knows when medium-term is going to happen of mid-70s, the clear strength of the franchise producing 23% ROTCE in a quarter where your CET1 is 13.8% and a reserve that already reflects 5.8% unemployment.",quarter,Erika Najarian,Analyst,7,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-14
"As we think about recession and what JPMorgan can earn in a recession, do you think you can hit 17% ROTCE even in 2024 – assuming we do have a recession in 2024 as everybody is expecting – given all these revenue dynamics and how prepared you are on the reserve?",quarter,Erika Najarian,Analyst,7,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-14
"Yeah. I mean that's an interesting question, Erika. I guess I'll say a couple things.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,7,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-14
"It's a great question, so I want to see how Jeremy answers it.",quarter,Jamie Dimon,CEO,7,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-14
Okay. Let's take a crack. Let's see what the boss thinks.,quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,7,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-14
"I think number one, we believe, have said, and continue to believe that this is fundamentally a 17% through the cycle ROTCE franchise, so number one.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,7,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-14
"Number two, as Jamie always says, we run this company for all different scenarios and to have it be as resilient as possible across all different scenarios.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,7,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-14
"On the particular question of ROTCE expectations in 2024 contingent on the particular economic outlook, obviously it depends a lot on the nature of the recession.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,7,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-14
"I think we feel really good about how the company is positioned for a recession, but we're a bank.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,7,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-14
"A very serious recession is of course going to be a headwind for returns, but we think even in a fairly severe recession, we'll deliver very good returns – whether that's 17% or not is too much detail for now.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,7,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-14
Thank you.,quarter,Erika Najarian,Analyst,7,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-14
The next question comes from the line of Jim Mitchell from Seaport Global Securities. You may proceed.,quarter,Operator,Host,7,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-14
"Hey. Good morning. Maybe just a little bit on the deposit, your thought process there. You've seen some inflows. Why do you think that you lose them going forward?",quarter,Jim Mitchell,Analyst,8,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-14
"And just maybe talk a little bit about the dynamic in pricing – do you feel like given the inflows, do you see some pricing power for the larger banks?",quarter,Jim Mitchell,Analyst,8,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-14
"Yeah. A couple things there. So, first of all, we don't know. Right? The deposits just came in. We don't know. We're guessing.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,8,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-14
"Number two, the deposits just came in. So, by definition, these are somewhat flighty deposits because they just came into us, so it's prudent and appropriate for us to assume that they won't be particularly stable.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,8,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-14
"Number three, there's a natural amount of internal migration of deposits to money funds so you have to overlay that and that's embedded in our assumptions.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,8,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-14
"And number four, it's a competitive market, and it's entirely possible that people temporarily come to us and then over time decide to go elsewhere.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,8,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-14
"So, for all of those reasons, we're just being realistic about the stickiness of it.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,8,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-14
"If I add, I would say, categorically, there's no pricing power that the bigger banks have because if you look at the pricing – and we look at pricing sheets all the time – every bank is in a slightly different position and every bank is competing in three-month, six-month, nine-month savings rates.",quarter,Jamie Dimon,CEO,8,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-14
"And then you have the online banks, you got treasury bills, you got money market funds. There's no pricing power for the bank, but obviously we all have different franchises and we're all in a slightly different position.",quarter,Jamie Dimon,CEO,8,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-14
"No, fair – all fair points. And maybe just a follow-up on John's question on the lending environment. You talked about the industry likely pulling back.",quarter,Jim Mitchell,Analyst,8,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-14
Are you changing your underwriting standards in any way? Just trying to think through is there potential for some market share gains given your strength of capital and liquidity? Or how you're thinking about the loan environment?,quarter,Jim Mitchell,Analyst,8,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-14
"I'd say very modestly, but we look at that all the time.",quarter,Jamie Dimon,CEO,8,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-14
"Yeah. And we always say, right, we underwrite through the cycle.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,8,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-14
"And I think notably, we didn't loosen our underwriting standards when all the numbers looked crazy good during the pandemic, and we're not going to overreact now and tighten unreasonably.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,8,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-14
"Some of that correction happens naturally – credit metrics deteriorate for borrowers whether in consumer or wholesale, and that might make them leave our pre-existing risk appetite, but we're not running around aggressively tightening standards right now.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,8,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-14
Okay. Great. Thanks.,quarter,Jim Mitchell,Analyst,8,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-14
The next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC Capital Markets. You may proceed.,quarter,Operator,Host,8,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-14
"Thank you. Hi, Jeremy.",quarter,Gerard Cassidy,Analyst,9,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-14
"Hey, Gerard.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,9,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-14
"In your comments about your CET1 ratio, obviously it came in strong at 13.8%.",quarter,Gerard Cassidy,Analyst,9,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-14
"You've got the GSIB buffer obviously going up next year, and we have the stress test coming this summer or in June – the results – which maybe will lead to banks, including yours, having a higher Stress Capital Buffer. Where should we think about that CET1 ratio being by the end of the year, do you think?",quarter,Gerard Cassidy,Analyst,9,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-14
"Yeah. So a few things on there, Gerard.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,9,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-14
"So we have previously said that we were targeting 13.5% in the first quarter of 2024 as a function of assuming an unchanged SCB, the increased GSIB step and operating with a 50-basis-point buffer.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,9,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-14
"So, the point that Jamie made a second ago, in light of the environment, Basel IV, dry powder, you know, who knows how we'll tweak that going forward. But that's still our base case assumption.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,9,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-14
"Specifically on the stress test, contrary to what I've heard some people argue, our ability to predict the SCB ahead of time from running our own process is actually quite limited.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,9,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-14
"And you'll remember last year that even though we did predict an increase, we were off by almost a factor of two in terms of how big it wound up being, and that was a big surprise for the whole industry.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,9,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-14
"So, we want to be quite humble about our ability to predict the SCB.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,9,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-14
"But having said that, for right now we are assuming it will be unchanged. There are some tailwinds in there through the OCI, but we believe there will likely be some offsets and harsher credit shocks in the number, so for planning purposes right now we're assuming flat for SCB, and we'll know soon enough what that actual number is.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,9,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-14
"Sure. And then just as a follow-up, if I heard you correctly, can you give us a little more color – I think you mentioned in building the loan loss reserve this quarter you identified some one-off credits?",quarter,Gerard Cassidy,Analyst,9,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-14
I don't know if that's how you said it – there's some larger credits. Were they commercial real estate oriented? Were they commercial? Any more color there?,quarter,Gerard Cassidy,Analyst,9,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-14
"No, it wasn't commercial real estate. It was just a couple of single name items in the Corporate segment.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,9,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-14
Leverage loan-type items or just regular Corporate credits?,quarter,Gerard Cassidy,Analyst,9,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-14
Regular Corporate credits. I'd rather not get into too much detail...,quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,9,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-14
"Okay, very good.",quarter,Gerard Cassidy,Analyst,10,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-14
…Gerard. Sorry. Thanks.,quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,10,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-14
Thank you.,quarter,Gerard Cassidy,Analyst,10,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-14
The next question comes from the line of Ebrahim Poonawala with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. You may proceed.,quarter,Operator,Host,10,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-14
"Hi, good morning. I guess, maybe one question, Jeremy. You reminded us of the relatively low office exposure for JPM. But, obviously, you're big players in the CRE market.",quarter,Ebrahim H. Poonawala,Analyst,10,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-14
"Just give us a sense of when you look at the two pressure points on CRE, one, how much is oversupply – and that probably goes beyond office into apartments – how much of a issue is oversupply in the market as we think about the next few years going into a weakening economy?",quarter,Ebrahim H. Poonawala,Analyst,10,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-14
"And how much of a risk is higher for longer rates in that if the central banks can't cut rates in the next year or two, we will see a ton of more pain because of the re-fi wall that's coming up?",quarter,Ebrahim H. Poonawala,Analyst,10,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-14
"Yeah, so Ebrahim let me sort of respond narrowly in connection with our portfolio and our exposure, right?",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,10,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-14
"So, really, the large majority of our commercial real estate exposure is multi-family lending in supply constrained markets.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,10,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-14
"And I think it's quite important to recognize the difference between that and sort of higher end, higher price point, non-rent controlled, not supply constrained markets.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,10,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-14
"So, our space is really quite different in that respect, and I think that's a big part of the reason the performance has been so good for so long.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,10,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-14
"So, of course, we watch it very carefully and we don't assume that past performance predicts future results here, but I think our multi-family lending portfolio is quite low risk in the scheme of things.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,10,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-14
"Can I just add also, housing is in short supply in America. It's not massively oversupplied like you saw in 2008.",quarter,Jamie Dimon,CEO,10,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-14
"Yeah. And then in terms of the office space, as you know, our exposure is quite small.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,10,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-14
"Yes, Jamie, has also mentioned all the re-fi dynamics that you mentioned too are something that the office space is processing one way or the other.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,10,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-14
"Our office exposure is quite modest, very concentrated in Class A buildings in sort of dense urban locations where the return to the office narrative is one of the drivers – is generally in favor of high occupancy.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,10,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-14
"So, again, watching it. There are obviously specific things here and there to pay attention to, but in the scheme of things for us, not a big issue.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,10,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-14
"And just as a follow up, I think the other risk from higher for longer rates, I think, is this – the ability of the economy, the financial markets to sustain a 5% less Fed fund for a long period of time?",quarter,Ebrahim H. Poonawala,Analyst,10,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-14
"Like, what are the other areas you're watching if duration mismatch and bank balance sheets being one, CRE market being one, are you worrying – worried about non-banks that have grown exponentially over the last decade in terms of risks at the non-banks if rates don't get cut?",quarter,Ebrahim H. Poonawala,Analyst,11,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-14
And if you can talk to the transmission mechanism of that coming back and hitting banks given the leverage that banks provide to the non-banks.,quarter,Ebrahim H. Poonawala,Analyst,11,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-14
"Yeah, so I'd like to answer that. So there is a risk of higher rates for longer.",quarter,Jamie Dimon,CEO,11,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-14
"And don't just think of just the Fed Funds rate, because I think you should – for our planning – I'd be thinking more about it could be 6%.",quarter,Jamie Dimon,CEO,11,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-14
"And then think about the five- and ten-year rate which could be 5%, and I think if those things happen – I'm not saying they're going to happen – I just think people should prepare for them, they saw what just happened when rates went up beyond people's expectations.",quarter,Jamie Dimon,CEO,11,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-14
"You had the gilt problem in London, you had some of the banks here. People need to be prepared for the potential of higher rates for longer.",quarter,Jamie Dimon,CEO,11,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-14
"If and when that happens, it will undress problems in the economy for those who are too exposed to floating rates, for those who are too exposed to re-fi risk.",quarter,Jamie Dimon,CEO,11,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-14
Those exposures will be in multiple parts of the economy. I say to all of our clients – now would be the time to fix it.,quarter,Jamie Dimon,CEO,11,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-14
"Do not put yourself in a position where that risk is excessive for your company, your business, your investment pools, et cetera. That's answer number one.",quarter,Jamie Dimon,CEO,11,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-14
"Number two is, it will not come back to JPMorgan. Okay? While we do provide credit to what you call shadow banks, it is very – we think – it's very, very secure.",quarter,Jamie Dimon,CEO,11,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-14
That does not mean it won't come back to other credit providers.,quarter,Jamie Dimon,CEO,11,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-14
Got it. Very helpful. Thank you.,quarter,Ebrahim H. Poonawala,Analyst,11,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-14
The next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities. You may proceed.,quarter,Operator,Host,11,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-14
"Hey Jeremy, you mentioned a degree of reintermediation to the lending markets. You said capital markets activity has gone to bank lending, and I'm just wondering, as part of your $7 billion increased NII guide, are you assuming better loan spreads?",quarter,Mike Mayo,Analyst,11,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-14
"And on the topic of loan pricing, why aren't your credit card yields going higher than where they are today? Thanks.",quarter,Mike Mayo,Analyst,11,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-14
"Yeah, Mike. So I think, yeah, you're referring to my comments that I made in the Commercial Bank about the fact that the larger Corporate segment within the Commercial Bank that would generally have access to capital markets but also access to bank lending, at the margin is choosing to draw down revolvers right now rather than access the capital markets.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,11,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-14
"That is not a particularly meaningful driver of the increase in NII guidance. There's a lot of odds and ends in there, but the major drivers are the ones that I called out.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,11,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-14
"And to be honest, I haven't actually specifically checked what's happening with Card yields. I would imagine that they've gone up a little bit in line with rates, but I don't know. We should follow up here.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,11,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-14
"All right. And then one for you, Jamie. I guess taking the 10,000 foot level, I guess, when you look at asset liability management, or ALM – you could call this nightmare on ALM street, and you've seen some big problems at banks, and I guess how would you evaluate yourself, I guess, with this $7 billion higher NII guide?",quarter,Mike Mayo,Analyst,11,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-14
"It probably is good, but to what degree are you willing to sacrifice JPM shareholder money to help rescue problem banks that did not get their asset liability management correctly?",quarter,Mike Mayo,Analyst,11,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-14
"Well, it's two really different questions. So we've been quite cautious on interest rates for quite a while, and how we invest our portfolio, what our expectations are, our stress testing.",quarter,Jamie Dimon,CEO,12,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-14
"The stress test – the CCAR stress test, as you know, had rates going down. I always looked at rates going up and being prepared – whether or not anything is going to happen.",quarter,Jamie Dimon,CEO,12,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-14
"So we've been quite conservative ourselves and we don't mind continuing to do that because I remind people that having excess capital, you haven't lost it.",quarter,Jamie Dimon,CEO,12,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-14
"It's kind of earnings in store – you get to deploy it later and maybe at a more opportune time, when the time comes.",quarter,Jamie Dimon,CEO,12,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-14
"And look, we like to help the system when it needs help, if we can reasonably. And we're not the only ones, you saw a lot of banks do that, and I was proud of them. I think all of us did the right thing.",quarter,Jamie Dimon,CEO,12,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-14
"Whether ultimately it works out or not, well, you could second-guess that when it happens. But the fact is, I think people want to help the system.",quarter,Jamie Dimon,CEO,12,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-14
"And this whole banking thing was bad for banks. And I knew that the second I saw the headline, and then you had Credit Suisse.",quarter,Jamie Dimon,CEO,12,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-14
We want healthy community banks. We want healthy regional banks. We want to help them get through this.,quarter,Jamie Dimon,CEO,12,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-14
"We have, you'll remember, Mike, as you point out, we have the best financial system the world's ever seen.",quarter,Jamie Dimon,CEO,12,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-14
"That does not mean it won't have problems, doesn't mean there shouldn't be changes made, but I think it's reasonable for people to help each other in times of need.",quarter,Jamie Dimon,CEO,12,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-14
"And we all did that – all of us – did that during COVID. All of us did that – if you could, those who could – did it during the Great Financial Crisis, and I would expect people to do that going forward.",quarter,Jamie Dimon,CEO,12,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-14
"Hey Jamie, your CEO letter said the banking crisis isn't over. So, what do you mean by that? Or was that dated two weeks later? Are you talking contagion or what?",quarter,Mike Mayo,Analyst,12,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-14
"Yeah. So it's just – the number of banks offsides you can count on your hands, in terms of too much interest rate exposure, too much ATM, too much uninsured deposits.",quarter,Jamie Dimon,CEO,12,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-14
"And so there may be additional bank failures, something like that, which we don't know.",quarter,Jamie Dimon,CEO,12,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-14
But you're going to see next week regional banks have pretty good numbers. A lot of people are going to have – can take – actions to remediate some of the issues they may have going forward.,quarter,Jamie Dimon,CEO,12,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-14
"You've already seen things calm down quite a bit, particularly in deposit flows.",quarter,Jamie Dimon,CEO,12,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-14
Warren Buffett was on TV talking about that he would bet $1 million – I don't know if you saw that – that no depositor will lose money in America. That he's willing to bet his own money.,quarter,Jamie Dimon,CEO,12,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-14
"And of course, you know he's a very bright man.",quarter,Jamie Dimon,CEO,12,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-14
"So, this crisis is not 2008. It will pass.",quarter,Jamie Dimon,CEO,12,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-14
"And the one thing I pointed out is, when I answered the question just before about interest rates – people need to be prepared. They shouldn't pray that they don't go up. They should prepare for them going up. And if it doesn't happen, serendipity.",quarter,Jamie Dimon,CEO,12,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-14
All right. Thank you.,quarter,Mike Mayo,Analyst,12,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-14
Yeah.,quarter,Jamie Dimon,CEO,12,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-14
The next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. You may proceed.,quarter,Operator,Host,12,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-14
Hi. Good morning.,quarter,Betsy L. Graseck,Analyst,12,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-14
"Hey, Betsy.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,13,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-14
I do want to unpack the question here on the possibility of higher for longer rates and how that impacts you in your non-Markets NII...,quarter,Betsy L. Graseck,Analyst,13,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-14
"Betsy, did we just lose you? I feel like you just dropped.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,13,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-14
"No, hear me? Hello?",quarter,Betsy L. Graseck,Analyst,13,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-14
Go ahead.,quarter,Jamie Dimon,CEO,13,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-14
Yeah. You're back now.,quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,13,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-14
"Okay. So I just wanted to unpack the higher for longer rate possibility as to how it impacts your NII because your NII guide is assuming the forward curve, if I understand correctly.",quarter,Betsy L. Graseck,Analyst,13,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-14
"So, in the event that you get that higher for longer, just how much does that impact NII ex. Markets because I'm trying to triangulate here about – maybe you lose some deposits, but if we have higher for longer, shouldn't we expect the trajectory goes up from this quarter as opposed to down? Is that – that's the question.",quarter,Betsy L. Graseck,Analyst,13,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-14
"Go ahead, Jeremy. And then I'll go.",quarter,Jamie Dimon,CEO,13,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-14
"Sure. So, Betsy, your question is very good.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,13,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-14
"And I would say that if you look at the evolution of our outlook last year, it was pretty clear that we were very asset-sensitive, certainly in terms of the sort of one year forward EaR type measure.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,13,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-14
"You also obviously know that our current EaR actually shows a slight negative number, so a tiny bit liability sensitive, and I won't get into all the nuances about why that may or may not be a great predictor in the short-term.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,13,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-14
But the point is that the level of rates now is of course very different from what it was last year.,quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,13,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-14
"And at this level of rates, the relationship between our short-term NII evolution and the curve is not always going to be clear in any given moment.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,13,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-14
"It's quite tricky, and it can behave in somewhat wonky ways as a function of, again, what I've alluded to a couple times on this call – the competitive environment for deposits, which is not, in fact, a sort of mathematically predictable thing as a function of the rate curve. So, that's why we're emphasizing all the different drivers of uncertainty in the NII outlook. Yeah.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,13,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-14
"Yeah. So I'll just add, so next quarter we all kind of know already. Two quarters out, we know a little bit less. Three quarters out, we know a little bit less. And 2024, we know very little.",quarter,Jamie Dimon,CEO,14,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-14
"That number, you could imagine – this is a little inside baseball now – the number that we're talking about for 2024 is not based upon an implied curve. It's based upon us looking at multiple potential scenarios, leveling them kind of out and saying this is kind of a range.",quarter,Jamie Dimon,CEO,14,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-14
"And you're absolutely correct. You could have an environment of higher for longer that might be better than that, but remember, higher for longer comes with a lot of other things attached to it – like maybe a recession, stagflation, lower volumes.",quarter,Jamie Dimon,CEO,14,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-14
So I wouldn't look at that as higher for longer is a positive. It might be a slight positive on that line. It would probably would be a negative on other lines.,quarter,Jamie Dimon,CEO,14,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-14
"Yeah. Got it. Okay, that's super helpful to understand how you think through that. And then the follow-up is just on the buybacks. So do I take your comments to mean that you're on pause now?",quarter,Betsy L. Graseck,Analyst,14,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-14
"And if that's the case, what would be the driver of restarting?",quarter,Betsy L. Graseck,Analyst,14,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-14
Yeah. No. We're not on pause now. We're doing a little bit now.,quarter,Jamie Dimon,CEO,14,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-14
"We obviously have a lot of excess capital. We also like to buy our stock when it's cheap, not just when it's available.",quarter,Jamie Dimon,CEO,14,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-14
"And we're also peering ahead, looking at those little bit of storm clouds so we're going to be kind of cautious.",quarter,Jamie Dimon,CEO,14,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-14
"So we're going to make this decision every day. We also don't like to tell the market what we're doing, just so you know.",quarter,Jamie Dimon,CEO,14,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-14
Yeah. And then can you give us any sense of what Basel IV endgame means to you in your RWAs? How much should we be baking in for those?,quarter,Betsy L. Graseck,Analyst,14,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-14
"Yeah, Betsy, we really don't have any new information there, right?",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,14,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-14
"I mean, I think clearly if you go back like a year, we were maybe a little bit more optimistic that it might be across all the different levers and all the different pieces of it, closer to capital neutral.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,14,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-14
"I think now it feels like it’s likely to be worse than that. Hopefully, it’s not too much worse than that.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,14,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-14
"And I would just remind you that there are a lot of different levers, so when the NPR comes, that's only going to be a part of it, there's going to be other pieces – the holistic review.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,14,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-14
And it's going to take a lot of time to phase in and we're going to have time to adjust. So we'll know when we know.,quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,14,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-14
Got it.,quarter,Betsy L. Graseck,Analyst,14,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-14
"And there were supposed – I just remembered, there were supposed to be pauses in there about how they looked at banks relative to the global economy, which are getting smaller.",quarter,Jamie Dimon,CEO,14,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-14
"The G-SIFI was supposed to be adjusted for that. So, it may very – we're expecting it go up, but there are a lot of reasons why it shouldn't go up.",quarter,Jamie Dimon,CEO,14,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-14
"And JPMorgan – there's so much capital. I mean, so you can't look at JPMorgan and say, well, it's a capital issue.",quarter,Jamie Dimon,CEO,14,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-14
"And even the banks, by the way, when you look at it – even though some of the banks that are in trouble, they have plenty of capital. Their issue wasn't capital, it was other things. And so I'm just hoping regulators are very thoughtful.",quarter,Jamie Dimon,CEO,14,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-14
"And the other thing is they should a priori decide what they want out of the banking system at this point because I've made it clear – I can look at the banking system and say that no bank should keep a loan, if possible.",quarter,Jamie Dimon,CEO,14,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-14
That's how much capital is now being required for loans.,quarter,Jamie Dimon,CEO,14,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-14
This is based on the current rule set.,quarter,Betsy L. Graseck,Analyst,15,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-14
"Yeah, because the market is pricing holds. The market would take loans at much lower capital ratio than banks are being forced to hold for them.",quarter,Jamie Dimon,CEO,15,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-14
"I'm talking about just loans only. So that's why you're seeing a lot of capital go to – I mean a lot of credit go to non-banks, and dramatically, by the way. Rapidly and dramatically.",quarter,Jamie Dimon,CEO,15,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-14
"And so if you're a regulator, you should be looking at it and saying, do I want that? Is that a good thing for the system?",quarter,Jamie Dimon,CEO,15,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-14
"If you believe it's a good thing for the system, raise the capital and more credit will go out of the system. That's fine. If that's what they want, that's fine.",quarter,Jamie Dimon,CEO,15,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-14
"But they should do it with a forethought, not accidentally.",quarter,Jamie Dimon,CEO,15,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-14
"I like the NII from loans better than the gain on sale, so I'll prefer the former not the latter. But thanks, appreciate it.",quarter,Betsy L. Graseck,Analyst,15,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-14
Yes.,quarter,Jamie Dimon,CEO,15,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-14
Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI. Your line is now open.,quarter,Operator,Host,15,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-14
"Thank you. So you talked about in your letter about regulators avoiding the knee-jerk reaction, which you addressed earlier.",quarter,Glenn Schorr,Analyst,15,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-14
I'm curious on your thoughts around how customers have reacted and should react.,quarter,Glenn Schorr,Analyst,15,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-14
"Now my point, my question is – consumers can move excess cash balances if they want more insurance. They can do that in a lot of different ways: move it, treasuries, money market, extra accounts, whatever.",quarter,Glenn Schorr,Analyst,15,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-14
"The issue, the question I have for you is on the corporate side. Have you seen big changes in how corporate treasurers or CFOs are adapting their cash balances and working capital – and should they need to? And I appreciate your Warren Buffett comments.",quarter,Glenn Schorr,Analyst,15,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-14
"Yeah, Glenn, in short, we really haven't seen big changes to speak of.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,15,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-14
"And I do think it's just worth saying – I think you're sort of hinting at this a little bit when you talk about the behavior of corporates – that when we talk about responses to the recent events through the lens of uninsured deposits, that's obviously very different if you're talking about large balances of non-operating uninsured deposits from financial institutions or de facto financial institutions versus normal large corporate operating balances, which is, of course, like core banking business for all of us.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,15,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-14
"When we saw it in Commercial Banking, Payments, Investment Banking and Custody, you did see money move – or I would call excess cash was moved out. But they have options.",quarter,Jamie Dimon,CEO,15,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-14
"What I would call more like operational cash –  so think even of a small companies, middle market companies, et cetera – that tends to be fairly sticky because you have your loans there, you have your money there, you're getting more and more competitive in rates.",quarter,Jamie Dimon,CEO,15,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-14
And that's why I think you see lot of regional banks – they've got sticky middle market deposits.,quarter,Jamie Dimon,CEO,15,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-14
"If I lent you $30 million and you have $10 million, you're probably going to leave it at my bank. And they also are more competitive on the rate for that.",quarter,Jamie Dimon,CEO,15,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-14
"So, I think you shouldn't be looking at deposit like one class – there's a whole bunch of different types, and analytically you go through each one and try to figure out what the stickiness is, and what the stickiness is and et cetera and so on.",quarter,Jamie Dimon,CEO,15,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-14
"But I think they have already – as the Fed has raised rates, you've already seen – that's the reason we expected outflows both from consumers and corporate customers.",quarter,Jamie Dimon,CEO,15,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-14
"Interesting. Just follow-up, the other thing that caught my eye in the letter is you mentioned that you're exploring new capital optimization strategies including partnerships and securitizations.",quarter,Glenn Schorr,Analyst,16,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-14
What's different than what you've already been doing for the last 30 years?,quarter,Glenn Schorr,Analyst,16,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-14
"We've got our smartest people, we’re going to figure out every angle to reduce capital requirements for JPMorgan. That's the difference.",quarter,Jamie Dimon,CEO,16,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-14
"And we've been doing it, but there's securitizations, there are partnerships.",quarter,Jamie Dimon,CEO,16,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-14
"You're seeing a lot of the private equity do the life insurance companies, and I expect that we're going to come up with a whole bunch of different things over time. And we'll shed certain assets, too.",quarter,Jamie Dimon,CEO,16,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-14
"Yeah. Thanks, Jamie.",quarter,Glenn Schorr,Analyst,16,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-14
Our final question comes from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. You may proceed.,quarter,Operator,Host,16,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-14
Good morning. You guys talked about one of the drivers of the higher net interest income guide this year is due to likely higher credit card balances.,quarter,Matt O'Connor,Analyst,16,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-14
"And I was just wondering if you could flush out what changed there on the outlook today versus three months ago. And I guess, is it a good or bad thing that those balances will be higher than you thought?",quarter,Matt O'Connor,Analyst,16,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-14
Yeah. So the story there is kind of the same story we've been talking about for a while. It's just a matter of degree.,quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,16,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-14
"So we had revolving balances obviously drop a lot during the pandemic period and then we talked about having them recover in absolute dollar terms to the same level as we'd had pre-pandemic, which I think happened last quarter.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,16,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-14
"And then the remaining narrative is just the further normalization of the revolve per-account, because we also have seen some account growth, and that continues to happen.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,16,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-14
"And so also, to Mike's question earlier, we're seeing a higher yield there as well.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,16,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-14
"So, and on your question of whether it's good or bad, obviously there's a point at which the consumers have too much leverage. We don't see that yet, so.",quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,16,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-14
It's normalization.,quarter,Jamie Dimon,CEO,16,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-14
Yeah.,quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,16,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-14
It's a good thing for us.,quarter,Jamie Dimon,CEO,16,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-14
Yeah.,quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,17,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-14
"Okay. And then just separately to squeeze in – you guys took some securities losses again this quarter. And in the past you've talked about really just going security-by-security looking for, kind of, pricing opportunities. Is that kind of what drove it again this quarter, or is there some kind of broader, overarching…",quarter,Matt O'Connor,Analyst,17,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-14
"That'll be every quarter for the rest of our lives. Sell what we find rich, and we buy what we think is dear...",quarter,Jamie Dimon,CEO,17,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-14
Cheap.,quarter,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,17,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-14
Cheap.,quarter,Jamie Dimon,CEO,17,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-14
Okay. All right. Thank you.,quarter,Matt O'Connor,Analyst,17,Q and A,Q1_2023,2023-04-14
We have no further questions.,quarter,Operator,Host,17,Conclusion,Q1_2023,2023-04-14
"Excellent. Folks, thank you very much.",quarter,Jamie Dimon,CEO,17,Conclusion,Q1_2023,2023-04-14
