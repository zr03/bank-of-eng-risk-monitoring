"At this time, we will open the floor for questions. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question will come from Glenn Schorr with Evercore. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.",quarter,OPERATOR,Other,6,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-15
"Hi. Thanks very much. Good guidance. I appreciate it. I'm curious on the card losses in Retail financial services, if you could talk to like, the 2024 exit rate seems like it will be higher than the full year guide at 6.25%. Maybe you could talk to the trajectory there and then the huge reserves that you have built in there and anything you can tell us about the portfolios so we can keep expectations in the right spot. Thanks.",quarter,Glenn Schorr,Analyst,6,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-15
"Yeah, sure. Why don't I take that. Good morning, Glenn.",quarter,Mark Mason,CFO,6,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-15
"So a couple things. So, one, I think that on Retail Services you're seeing a couple of things kind of play out.",quarter,Mark Mason,CFO,6,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-15
"So, one, you're seeing kind of spend volumes trend down a bit. You are seeing payment rates come down as well.",quarter,Mark Mason,CFO,6,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-15
That obviously is fueling the average interest earning balance growth that we're seeing.,quarter,Mark Mason,CFO,6,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-15
"And then you are also seeing with the spend volume come down, there's a denominator effect that plays through which pushes up obviously the loss rates that we're seeing.",quarter,Mark Mason,CFO,6,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-15
"That still in the quarter is in line with our guidance but in light of what we saw earlier in the year and normal seasonality, we would expect that number to be on the higher end of that range and likely higher in the fourth quarter, but the higher in the fourth quarter again depends on what traffic is like and what the holiday spending season looks like through the end of the year.",quarter,Mark Mason,CFO,6,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-15
I would say the reserve levels we have are very healthy as it relates to this portfolio. I think in the back of the deck we show kind of the reserve to loan ratio at about 11.7% or so. So well-reserved for the Retail Services portfolio in light of the environment that we're in.,quarter,Mark Mason,CFO,6,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-15
"Similarly, we are seeing the stabilization from a delinquency point of view across both portfolios kind of play through and so net-net, we are obviously actively managing this.",quarter,Mark Mason,CFO,7,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-15
"The retail partner activity is a critical component of it and that will drive fourth quarter activity or levels, but we do feel as if we'll end up on the higher end of the range here.",quarter,Mark Mason,CFO,7,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-15
"Okay. Thanks for all that, Mark. Just one quickie On your partnership with Apollo, very interesting and in line with a lot of other things we've seen. Curious on how you thought about going with one specific partner versus a group and then more importantly, are there other parts of the franchise that could benefit with stronger ties to private markets, I'm thinking specifically in the asset-backed world. Appreciate it. Thank you.",quarter,Glenn Schorr,Analyst,7,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-15
So we're delighted to partner with Apollo because what this does is it's uniting our comprehensive banking reach and expertise together and it's enabling us to offer our clients more innovative and tailored financing solutions.,quarter,Jane Fraser,CEO,7,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-15
There will be some other partners involved in this as well. Mubadala is another participant in this.,quarter,Jane Fraser,CEO,7,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-15
"And when we look at this, it's very, very beneficial for our clients. We're always looking at how we can best serve our clients, give them the most options and this platform enhances corporate and sponsor clients access to the private lending capital pool at real scale in $25 billion is a very sizable partnership here and it provides funding certainty and strategic transactions.",quarter,Jane Fraser,CEO,7,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-15
"It's exclusive for LBOs, non-investment grade in the US. The US is obviously the bulk of the private credit market, it’s the behemoth globally. It would be great to see that market developing in Europe and it wouldn't surprise me to see us doing more partnerships and other pieces going forward.",quarter,Jane Fraser,CEO,7,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-15
Our next question will come from Ebrahim Poonawala with Bank of America. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.,quarter,OPERATOR,Other,7,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-15
"Good morning. I guess maybe, Mark, for you, like looking at slide 7 on NII, and maybe we can break it down into Markets and ex-Markets. In the ex-Markets NII, $11.96 billion this quarter, based on what you've said, the back book repricing, deposit flex, is it safe to conclude that the ex-Markets NII bottomed in 2Q 2024? And I noticed the securities yield actually went lower, 7 bps quarter-over-quarter. So was there something one-off that impacted the yield this quarter relative to the expectations you outlined earlier?",quarter,Ebrahim Poonawala,Analyst,7,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-15
"So when you look at slide 7, you got a couple of things playing through. So your point around the low number, the low print, $11.46 billion in the second quarter, that really is a combination relative to first quarter of FX translation, some seasonally lower card balances, and lower interest payments in Argentina playing through that sequential 1Q to 2Q.",quarter,Mark Mason,CFO,7,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-15
"The third quarter, as I mentioned earlier, is really a by-product of volumes on the lending side and spreads, deposit spreads in Services and Wealth and I think that I've already given kind of the guide for the fourth quarter where that is likely to be flat.",quarter,Mark Mason,CFO,7,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-15
But I think it's important to just remind everyone of the headwinds and tailwinds that play through this NII line.,quarter,Mark Mason,CFO,7,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-15
"And from a tailwind point of view, I would expect to see continued volume from loans, USPB in particular but also Services and we're talking ex-Markets, so Services.",quarter,Mark Mason,CFO,7,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-15
"I'd also expect to see continued benefit from the reinvestment of securities at higher yields and then we're actively managing beta as it relates to with our clients and if you think about kind of what we saw in the uptick of rates, we're actively managing that on the down tick as it relates to our institutional clients.",quarter,Mark Mason,CFO,7,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-15
I think the other point here is let's not forget that our interest rate sensitivity skews more towards non-US and so a lot of what we think about and talk about tends to be how US rates move and the betas around that.,quarter,Mark Mason,CFO,7,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-15
We're still going to have a bit of beta catch-up outside of the US and so that's one of the headwinds there as well as the Legacy Franchise exits.,quarter,Mark Mason,CFO,7,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-15
"So you've got this long-winded way of saying, I do expect flat into the fourth quarter. I'm not going to give guidance for 2025.",quarter,Mark Mason,CFO,7,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-15
"But what I will say is to keep the growth momentum to get to our medium-term targets, that's 4% to 5% of a CAGR and that's going to be a combination of NII and NIR but skewing NIR.",quarter,Mark Mason,CFO,7,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-15
And I want to point that out because the third quarter and the year-to-date numbers that you see in our performance shows very strong fee NIR growth across each of these five businesses and I don't want to lose sight of that as you all really try to get a handle on how we get to that medium term.,quarter,Mark Mason,CFO,8,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-15
"We're evidencing that shift towards more fee revenue as we speak. So I'll stop there, but I think that's important and hopefully I've answered your question around the NII forecast here.",quarter,Mark Mason,CFO,8,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-15
"That's helpful. And agreed on the fee momentum. Just one quick on the Wealth segment. We've seen a considerable progress year-to-date in terms of going from zero ROE to about 8.5% RoTCE, significant operating leverage. I think I heard Jane say that momentum should continue. Is it fair to assume that RoTCE remains, like Wealth remains a positive story as we think about how Citi's ROE continues to improve from here as we get towards the target? Any color on the Wealth side would be helpful. Thank you.",quarter,Ebrahim Poonawala,Analyst,8,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-15
"Yes, I agree with you. I think we're all very pleased to see the progress on the strategy we laid out at Investor Day.",quarter,Jane Fraser,CEO,8,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-15
The Wealth target we have in the medium term is 15% to 20% and with that a 25% to 30% operating margin and we're making steady progress there.,quarter,Jane Fraser,CEO,8,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-15
I think the first piece was putting the pieces of the global wealth organization together and now we're focused on positioning for growth and reshaping the business to deliver the returns that we all expect.,quarter,Jane Fraser,CEO,8,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-15
A very important part of that is shifting our mix by growing investments. We had 24% growth in client investment assets this quarter. I would call that a good start to realizing the potential that we have here.,quarter,Jane Fraser,CEO,8,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-15
"And at the same time, Andy continues to right-size our expense base and drive productivity. Our advisor productivity increased over 50% in Citigold North America. So a number of different areas that he's focused on so that we can continue to grow the investment space including some important new talent that we've been bringing in that I'm sure you've noticed.",quarter,Jane Fraser,CEO,8,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-15
Our next question will come from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.,quarter,OPERATOR,Other,8,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-15
"Hi. What assurance can you give that Citi can both meet its 2026 expense guide, the $51 billion to $53 billion and I note the year-to-date run rate implies $54 billion.",quarter,Mike Mayo,Analyst,8,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-15
So getting from that $54 billion run rate down to the $51 billion to $53 billion by 2026 and meet its regulatory targets.,quarter,Mike Mayo,Analyst,8,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-15
"In other words, assurance that Citi can both walk and chew gum at the same time.",quarter,Mike Mayo,Analyst,8,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-15
"And I guess I'd highlight as you know, on October 2 Senator Warren asked the OCC to impose growth restrictions because Citi is ""too big to manage.""",quarter,Mike Mayo,Analyst,8,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-15
"I would assume you don't agree with that, but still the question that a lot of people have is what assurances can you give that an asset cap won't happen at Citigroup? Thanks.",quarter,Mike Mayo,Analyst,8,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-15
"Thanks, Mike. So why don't I start with your expense question and I'm sure Jane will chime in on some of the other parts of your question.",quarter,Mark Mason,CFO,8,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-15
"So, look, we put out medium term targets of $51 billion to $53 billion in 2026, revenue dependent, of course, and that's consistent with the target we gave of less than 60% efficiency ratio.",quarter,Mark Mason,CFO,8,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-15
And we've got a target this year as you know on the high end of $53.8 billion [ex-FDIC special assessment and Civil Money Penalties]. And so we've got to get from $53.8 billion down to $51 billion to $53 billion by 2026.,quarter,Mark Mason,CFO,8,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-15
I'm not giving guidance for 2025 but you can expect that that will likely glide down to that number.,quarter,Mark Mason,CFO,8,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-15
What's driving the reduction? So we've talked before about $1.5 billion in savings largely related to the restructuring and driving down headcount reduction associated with that.,quarter,Mark Mason,CFO,8,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-15
We talked about another $500 million to $1 billion related to expense reductions from eliminating stranded cost as we continue to exit. We're out of nine of these consumer countries already.,quarter,Mark Mason,CFO,8,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-15
And we talk about starting to see efficiencies and benefits from the investments and the transformation and technology towards the end of 2026. And those are the three drivers that are important for us to continue to realize between now and 2026.,quarter,Mark Mason,CFO,8,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-15
"Will there be headwinds? Yes. There will be, the transformation is a multiyear process.",quarter,Mark Mason,CFO,8,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-15
"We're also investing in risk controls and regulatory spend to support improving our operations. Of course, there will be headwinds but there will also be things that we shift away from.",quarter,Mark Mason,CFO,8,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-15
There will be tailwinds associated with it. Jane mentioned some of the productivity efforts that both Andy as well as Vis are pushing on. You look across these businesses and you see positive operating leverage across the board.,quarter,Mark Mason,CFO,8,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-15
"So that means that Andy Morton as well as Gonzalo are too looking at their cost structures, at expenses that they can take out or productivity that they might improve.",quarter,Mark Mason,CFO,9,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-15
And so there will be additional costs that we have to incur. We incurred additional costs this year. But there will also be additional productivity savings that we continue to tease out to ensure that we get to these targets.,quarter,Mark Mason,CFO,9,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-15
"And, Mike, let me pick up on part of the second part of the question in terms of the progress on the transformation.",quarter,Jane Fraser,CEO,9,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-15
"As you know, and as Mark's talked to you about, the transformation reverses historic underinvestment in Citi's infrastructure. It enhances our risk and control environment. And it's a strategic overhaul as we've talked about that goes well beyond the consent order to simplify and to strengthen Citi to the benefit of all of the stakeholders we have.",quarter,Jane Fraser,CEO,9,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-15
"We are already a very different Citi today. We've made enormous change over the past three years, dramatically simpler business model, significant org change so we align our structure to that model.",quarter,Jane Fraser,CEO,9,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-15
"We now have a flatter organization with greater accountability and as Mark talked about through the investments in our transformation, we're focused on simplifying our operational model, modernizing our infrastructure risk and controls and all of that reduces risk as we go.",quarter,Jane Fraser,CEO,9,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-15
We're well on the way in executing the transformation plans. We've made meaningful progress as was acknowledged publicly by one of our regulators and it's a wide range book of work.,quarter,Jane Fraser,CEO,9,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-15
"We've made significant strides in areas such as risk management, compliance and accountability and that's well beyond the big bodies of work about consolidating our platforms.",quarter,Jane Fraser,CEO,9,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-15
"So we had 1,250 retired since 2022 as Mark mentioned.",quarter,Jane Fraser,CEO,9,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-15
"Other areas of progress, enhance our stress testing capabilities, they're faster, more frequent, more precise assessments.",quarter,Jane Fraser,CEO,9,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-15
"We put in place new target operating models for wholesale credit risk, enterprise risk, price risk firm wide.",quarter,Jane Fraser,CEO,9,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-15
A huge body of work reducing risk and high risk processes such as payments and Markets through systemic preventative controls.,quarter,Jane Fraser,CEO,9,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-15
"We've been implementing the XiNG platform, this is the strategic cloud solution for market risk analytics. Values trades on demand and at scale.",quarter,Jane Fraser,CEO,9,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-15
And we've embedded risk and controls into our performance management framework and tied that to compensation for the full firm. So these are just giving you a flavor of these big body of work that we are executing and getting done.,quarter,Jane Fraser,CEO,9,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-15
"I was very pleased that we closed the FRB, AML/BSA consent order particularly given heightened risk and scrutiny in this area.",quarter,Jane Fraser,CEO,9,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-15
That is the third consent order we've closed since 2021 and we've been very transparent.,quarter,Jane Fraser,CEO,9,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-15
"Where there are areas in which our execution is delayed against our original timelines as is the case with our data work. We take a step back, determine what we need to change in those areas and get back on track and make relevant tech and people investments.",quarter,Jane Fraser,CEO,9,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-15
"So I feel very confident about the strategy we've laid out for the firm, the deliberate path we're on, the huge progress we've already made, and that we will continue making with determination and with clarity going forward.",quarter,Jane Fraser,CEO,9,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-15
"So, just one follow-up. When, and you do have the amended consent order that's not new anymore, but is this a problem with your dealing with clients or is this an issue with giving the regulators the information that they need?",quarter,Mike Mayo,Analyst,9,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-15
"And just again, you don't, just to confirm, you don't have an asset cap now, is it fair to assume that you don't expect an asset cap any time soon or could you have an asset cap and we don't even know about that? Thanks.",quarter,Mike Mayo,Analyst,9,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-15
"We don't have any problems dealing with our clients, quite the opposite.",quarter,Jane Fraser,CEO,9,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-15
"We're a source of strength for our clients in terms of the provision of their payments businesses, their trading businesses, their consumer credit businesses, all across the board.",quarter,Jane Fraser,CEO,9,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-15
So I would say quite the opposite. We are a source of tremendous strength for them and you see that in the results of this quarter which were very pleasing across the board in every single one of our businesses.,quarter,Jane Fraser,CEO,9,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-15
We are working closely with our regulators. We incorporate their feedback as well as our own lessons learned.,quarter,Jane Fraser,CEO,9,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-15
"If we fall behind in an element of the consent orders but do understand the breadth of the consent order work as I laid out and the meaningful progress we're making across multiple areas, and when we fall behind in an area we increase the investments needed and look at any lessons learned in the approach and address it.",quarter,Jane Fraser,CEO,9,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-15
So I feel very comfortable.,quarter,Jane Fraser,CEO,9,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-15
"So again, we don't have – we're not talking about issues as it relates to client information, client data, client reporting.",quarter,Mark Mason,CFO,10,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-15
"We're not talking about information as it relates to financials. We're talking about regulatory reporting, all right.",quarter,Mark Mason,CFO,10,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-15
"And regulatory reporting as I've mentioned in prior calls, we're a global firm. We've got over 11,000 regulatory reports and we're talking about ensuring that the data that we capture at trade entry is the data that's required to ultimately show up on these various regulatory reports in the way that we need it ensuring that we've got the proper controls on that front end so we don't have to do a lot of the reconciliation and manual adjustments to that data in order to get it how we needed in the report and ensuring we have standardized rules and controls around that process so that we can do it as efficiently as possible.",quarter,Mark Mason,CFO,10,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-15
But this is largely around ensuring that we improve those regulatory reports that we have to produce by starting with the underlying data that's required to do that.,quarter,Mark Mason,CFO,10,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-15
Our next question will come from Jim Mitchell with Seaport Global. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.,quarter,OPERATOR,Other,10,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-15
"Hey, good morning. Mark, consensus expectations, and it's just another expense question in a different way. But consensus has you not hitting your revenue growth targets and you're certainly free to disagree and I think that's fine. But they also have your expenses at the high end of your $51 billion to $53 billion range in 2026. I guess, does that make sense or do you feel confident that if revenues do sort of disappoint your targets that you could come in at the – you should or can come in at the lower end of that range to help get to your RoTCE target.",quarter,Jim Mitchell,Analyst,10,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-15
"Yeah. So, let's take it in pieces. So I think – the first thing is that, I think Jane and I have been very consistent with trying to give guidance on full year performance for the past couple years and we've largely actually delivered on that guidance.",quarter,Mark Mason,CFO,10,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-15
"If you look at the top line growth since Investor Day, it's largely consistent with what we talked about in the medium term. If you look at the expense guidance that we've given, largely consistent with that including this year.",quarter,Mark Mason,CFO,10,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-15
"Even as I look at the $80 billion to $81 billion revenue guidance we gave for the year, and you look at the $60.6 billion that we've done year-to-date, and you think about what we have to deliver in order to hit that target, that is achievable particularly when you remember that we had a large Argentina devaluation last year.",quarter,Mark Mason,CFO,10,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-15
That fee momentum required in the fourth quarter is very achievable and we believe that we will obviously hit the high end of the [expense] range for 2024.,quarter,Mark Mason,CFO,10,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-15
"As I think about that outer year period and the guidance that we gave there, look, you all want proof points before you actually believe that we can deliver on that medium term target. I'm pointing you to proof points.",quarter,Mark Mason,CFO,10,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-15
"I'm hopeful that as you see those proof points through 2024, full year and each of the quarters, that you will start to believe in that revenue momentum that's required in the medium term.",quarter,Mark Mason,CFO,10,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-15
The fee revenue is a very good indicator. What we delivered this year and this quarter is a very good indicator of the momentum we should see across these businesses in the next couple years.,quarter,Mark Mason,CFO,10,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-15
"I also hope that you would then see that as we deliver on the expense target that we have a path to continuing to deliver on the medium-term expense target, the drivers of which I mentioned earlier.",quarter,Mark Mason,CFO,10,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-15
"Yes, if revenues come in short of the target that we've set for ourselves, you would naturally expect for the volume and transaction related expenses and compensation expenses to come down in a commensurate way with that revenue decline and you would also expect that we would look to see if there are other productivity opportunities that we can tease out in order to still deliver on that operating efficiency target that we've set for ourselves.",quarter,Mark Mason,CFO,10,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-15
"No, that's great color. I appreciate it. And maybe just as a follow-up on the capital question, I guess one thing that's been a bit of a headwind over the last year has been sort of growth from the DTA deductions. Do we start to see that become a tailwind again? How do we think about that accreting back into capital over the next couple of years?",quarter,Jim Mitchell,Analyst,10,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-15
"Yeah. Look, the main driver of our DTA utilization will be driving higher income in the US. That's going to be the major driver and as we think about – so as you think about each of the strategies that Jane has described for our business, you will often hear the importance of winning in the US.",quarter,Mark Mason,CFO,10,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-15
"You'll hear it as it relates to Banking and the activity that we saw, the strong performance we saw this quarter in Vis’s world, you hear it as it relates to the Wealth business and the importance of us growing investments particularly in North America.",quarter,Mark Mason,CFO,10,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-15
You see it in USPB which is largely a US focused business.,quarter,Mark Mason,CFO,11,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-15
"That DTA utilization is about us increasing net income or higher net income in the US and as we work to execute on our client driven strategy, we are looking for opportunities to do that.",quarter,Mark Mason,CFO,11,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-15
We're incenting the business to drive that momentum and that's what's going to give us a higher utilization on a quarter by quarter in the coming years.,quarter,Mark Mason,CFO,11,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-15
Our next question will come from Erika Najarian with UBS. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.,quarter,OPERATOR,Other,11,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-15
"Hi. I think we've slid over to the afternoon. Good afternoon, guys. The first one is for you, Jane. As I speak with longer term investors, they often offer the commentary that clearly the path from the 7% RoTCE this quarter to the 11% to 12% hopefully will be bridged and to be able to initiate a position before that progress is made, they really sort of want to see more capital optimization. And this question is not really the same question I ask you about buybacks every quarter but really maybe a progress update on Banamex. So there is chatter in the market about Banamex needed to have four quarters of separate financials before being IPOed and I'm wondering if you could give us specific progress on how that's going? And Mark, maybe remind us on what Banamex's contribution is as we think about the unlocking that excess capital versus taking it out of the P&L.",quarter,Erika Najarian,Analyst,11,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-15
"Yeah. I'd be delighted to, Erika. And I would also just before I jump into Banamex point to a laser focus on capital optimization.",quarter,Jane Fraser,CEO,11,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-15
"It's been a mantra for a long time in our Markets business, in Banking and a discipline that we've driven throughout the organization and I would say there isn't anyone at Citi that is not keenly aware of the focus around optimizing our capital.",quarter,Jane Fraser,CEO,11,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-15
"Returning to shareholders, particularly given where we're trading, and making sure that we drive to returns.",quarter,Jane Fraser,CEO,11,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-15
"So if I turn to Banamex, our singular focus right now is the separation of the two banks which we expect to complete in the fourth quarter of this year.",quarter,Jane Fraser,CEO,11,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-15
This has been an enormous body of work because we are creating effectively de novo Mexico's eighth largest bank.,quarter,Jane Fraser,CEO,11,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-15
We've just now gotten the core regulatory authorizations that we need to proceed with separation. Although there are a few other approvals pending.,quarter,Jane Fraser,CEO,11,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-15
We are in the very final stages and are working with our clients to prepare them for this switchover later on in Q4.,quarter,Jane Fraser,CEO,11,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-15
"Once the separation is complete, we will turn our full attention to the IPO itself and the successful execution of the IPO is the highest priority for our Head of International, Ernesto Torres Cantú, to run Banamex. And our incoming Banamex Executive Chairman who starts this quarter, Ignacio Deschamps.",quarter,Jane Fraser,CEO,11,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-15
"We plan to be ready to IPO at the end of 2025 based on the factors that we can control but I think as Mark and I have always said, the timing is going to be driven by market conditions to ensure we maximize the shareholder value.",quarter,Jane Fraser,CEO,11,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-15
"And we're making the necessary investments to continue growing share and I was very pleased that Banamex outpaced the average market revenue growth year-to-date, good expense discipline being maintained despite the complex separation process and the environment.",quarter,Jane Fraser,CEO,11,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-15
So I'm pleased with where we are and I hope that gives you a bit of a flavor of what the path ahead looks like.,quarter,Jane Fraser,CEO,11,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-15
"Yeah. In terms of the second part of your question, a couple things. So, one, we've been seeing good growth in our Mexico Consumer business.",quarter,Mark Mason,CFO,11,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-15
"We've also been investing in it appropriately so to make sure that we protect the strength of that franchise as we prepare it for separation, ultimately for the IPO.",quarter,Mark Mason,CFO,11,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-15
"Erika, if I understood your question right, if we turn to page 16 of the deck in the bottom right hand side, we show the P&L for Mexico Consumer for 2022 and 2023. And so you can see the contribution from a revenue and expense point of view so about $1.5 billion in 2023.",quarter,Mark Mason,CFO,12,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-15
"And I think it's about $4 billion or so of TCE that we have associated with this business. So that gives you some sense for the contribution, but it continues to perform quite well as we manage it through this process.",quarter,Mark Mason,CFO,12,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-15
"Perfect. Thank you. And as a follow-up question, I'm sure it is frustrating for you to see the stock reaction in a quarter where you had PPNR strength and better expectations for net interest income in the fourth quarter.",quarter,Erika Najarian,Analyst,12,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-15
"So maybe I'll frame the question this way for you, Mark. As we think about the gyrations in interest rate expectations globally, may be remind us sort of is it fair to assume that Citi is asset sensitive internationally and neutrally positioned domestically?",quarter,Erika Najarian,Analyst,12,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-15
How should we think about late fees? I know you told us that late fees going to $8 were part of your initial guide for the year.,quarter,Erika Najarian,Analyst,12,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-15
"And additionally, I think perhaps because capital markets is so strong across the board, across all of your peers, maybe that's not why you're getting, ""credit for your strength this quarter"".",quarter,Erika Najarian,Analyst,12,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-15
"So as we look into 2025 and having NIR be that bigger contribution to your revenue CAGR, maybe walk us through what are the other sort of core fee strengths that we should look for other than FICC and Banking remaining strong and coming back that could bring you to that path to 2026.",quarter,Erika Najarian,Analyst,12,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-15
Okay. There's a lot there. But thank you. Thank you for the question.,quarter,Mark Mason,CFO,12,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-15
"I would like to see the stock reacting much more favorably because this really has been a strong quarter for us and in fact as you mentioned, NII when you look through it, we've in fact taken our NII guidance up just a tad bit as we referenced that the full year would be slightly down versus modestly down with the fourth quarter that's flat to the third quarter and so that is an important takeaway.",quarter,Mark Mason,CFO,12,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-15
"I mentioned the headwinds and tailwinds earlier and we shouldn't lose sight of those. We will get lift from reinvesting the securities as those mature, we will continue to see volume growth and those are important drivers of tailwind activity for us.",quarter,Mark Mason,CFO,12,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-15
You rightfully mentioned our interest rate exposure analysis that we do on a quarterly basis that reflects the asset sensitivity of our business.,quarter,Mark Mason,CFO,12,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-15
"And last quarter it was about $1.6 billion or so of a negative, assuming 100 basis point decline across the curve, assuming a static balance sheet and cross-currencies.",quarter,Mark Mason,CFO,12,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-15
"And as you look at that asset sensitivity, again, you rightfully pointed out that we skew non-US in terms of the magnitude of that decline in NII should we see that parallel shift.",quarter,Mark Mason,CFO,12,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-15
"And in fact, it's as much as $1.3 billion or so of that $1.6 billion is non-US dollar related across 60 currencies.",quarter,Mark Mason,CFO,12,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-15
And so you'd have to see all of that move in tandem for that drag and the US dollar drag is about $300 million assuming 100 basis point shift and that's been coming down.,quarter,Mark Mason,CFO,12,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-15
"If you look back over the quarters, we've been thoughtfully managing that down and that's down to about $300 million number. I would expect when we print the third quarter Q, it will be down a bit more.",quarter,Mark Mason,CFO,12,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-15
"And so, again, we are asset sensitive but it does skew outside of the US and thank you for asking the question because I think it's important to remind our investors and analysts of that dynamic which in many ways may be different from that of other Institutions.",quarter,Mark Mason,CFO,12,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-15
"In terms of the late fees, we did say that we were including late fees in our assumptions, in our outlook that we've given.",quarter,Mark Mason,CFO,12,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-15
"I'll state the obvious Erika, which is that we want people to obviously pay on time and we do everything that we can to assist and ensure that they do that.",quarter,Mark Mason,CFO,12,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-15
"With that said, we don't have a definitive timeline on late fees, nor are we overly reliant on late fees to drive revenue for our firm.",quarter,Mark Mason,CFO,12,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-15
And so it looks like that decisioning will likely kind of fall closer to sometime in 2025 and so there is a small adjustment in the last quarter of our revenue forecast but it's inside of the guidance that we gave and doesn't materially change that in any way.,quarter,Mark Mason,CFO,12,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-15
"And then the last part of your question, I think, was around NIR and the fee revenue. And as I mentioned earlier, I'm not going to give guidance for 2025 but I think your question was around where are we likely to see continued momentum as it relates to fee revenue growth.",quarter,Mark Mason,CFO,12,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-15
"And I would start with Services where fees were up some 33% year-over-year and yes we should adjust for the Argentine Peso devaluation. But even if you adjust for that it's double-digit, 11% year-over-year non-interest revenue growth.",quarter,Mark Mason,CFO,12,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-15
"And when you look at those drivers they've been consistently strong. Cross-border transaction value up 8%, US dollar clearing volume up 7%, commercial card spend up 8%.",quarter,Mark Mason,CFO,12,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-15
In the supplement you'll see that it's mid to high single digit year-to-date growth across those KPIs as well. We expect that that will continue with our corporate clients and as we bring on new commercial clients as well.,quarter,Mark Mason,CFO,12,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-15
"I'll turn you to – if you look at Banking, we talked about already so I won't kind of lean into that too much but except to highlight a really strong quarter in Banking, in Investment Banking fees, in particular, the rebound that we've been talking about but importantly us capturing share in that rebound and these important partnerships that position us well as sponsors start to lean back into the market the investments that we've been making in talent, in sectors we need to strengthen. All of those things are going to play to continued fee momentum as we go into 2025.",quarter,Mark Mason,CFO,12,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-15
"Wealth, again, really strong performance this quarter with revenues up 9%. But look at the client investment assets, up 24%. The client balances up 14%. That's driving fee momentum and it's a keen area of focus for Andy and that team that he's pulled together and it's a real opportunity for us given the $5 trillion or so of assets that our clients hold away from us and we're better positioning ourselves to capture that.",quarter,Mark Mason,CFO,13,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-15
"And then finally, you can see kind of continued momentum on USPB but it's across the board is what I'm saying, Erika, in terms of that fee momentum and it is important.",quarter,Mark Mason,CFO,13,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-15
It's an important aspect as we think about getting to those medium term targets and that 4% to 5% revenue.,quarter,Mark Mason,CFO,13,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-15
Our next question will come from Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.,quarter,OPERATOR,Other,13,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-15
"Hi, Mark, hi, Jane.",quarter,Gerard Cassidy,Analyst,13,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-15
Good morning.,quarter,Mark Mason,CFO,13,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-15
"Mark, you touched on in your prepared comments about growing the US Personal Banking RoTCE to higher levels. And you mentioned two items. One, innovative products and the normalization of credit costs. Can you elaborate on those two items that will be contributing to the driver aside from the efficiency improvement that you also touched on?",quarter,Gerard Cassidy,Analyst,13,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-15
"Yeah, sure. So obviously USPB is a combination of the cards businesses that we have in the Retail Banking business and that cards portfolio has both Branded as well as Retail Services as part of it.",quarter,Mark Mason,CFO,13,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-15
"And even within Branded, we have proprietary cards where we frankly have been looking to how we can come up with new innovative products.",quarter,Mark Mason,CFO,13,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-15
One example of product innovation is the recent refresh that we did of our Strata Premier Card which was designed to drive acquisition and engagement with a new rewards offering. And with that acquisitions are up some 7% both quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year for Branded Cards so that's an example of product innovation.,quarter,Mark Mason,CFO,13,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-15
"Another one is we also launched FlexPay at Costco a few quarters ago and you can see good instalment loan growth as a consequence of that, up some 15% or so.",quarter,Mark Mason,CFO,13,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-15
"And so that type of product creation is important to acquisitions, it's important to ensuring the card stays top of wallet and important to driving some of that top line performance.",quarter,Mark Mason,CFO,13,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-15
"And then the other thing that I mentioned, you're right was around cost of credit and that really is the continued normalization of cost of credit.",quarter,Mark Mason,CFO,13,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-15
I mentioned a couple of times now the idea that multiple vintages are maturing at the same time. And that has to play through for us to kind of see a more normal level of credit and that will be important to the returns.,quarter,Mark Mason,CFO,13,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-15
"And again, we are starting to see stabilization in both the cost of credit line but also in delinquencies and that's a good indicator for us.",quarter,Mark Mason,CFO,13,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-15
"Very good. And then just following up on credit. In the Banking division, you guys mentioned the cost of credit was, I think, $177 million due to ACL build of $141 million. And it was due to a change in the mix in the portfolio. Can you share with us what that mix change was that drove this provision?",quarter,Gerard Cassidy,Analyst,13,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-15
It's a mix of kind of different asset classes and clients that we've lent against. There's nothing material or significant in that number.,quarter,Mark Mason,CFO,13,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-15
When you look at the nonaccrual loans that ratio still 31 basis points. So it's a mix change of our exposures but nothing material there.,quarter,Mark Mason,CFO,13,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-15
And we continue to see a very healthy corporate sector really across the world.,quarter,Jane Fraser,CEO,13,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-15
Our next question will come from the line of Vivek Juneja with JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.,quarter,OPERATOR,Other,13,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-15
"Hi. Two questions, Jane and Mark. One is on expenses and the other is on your response to the asset cap question before. So first one, expenses, an easier one. Earlier in the year you had said you expect about $700 million to $1 billion of severance charges in the $53.5 billion to $53.8 billion. Did you have any in the third quarter? Expect any if the fourth? And do you expect to be done with those this year or any to continue into next year too?",quarter,Vivek Juneja,Analyst,13,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-15
Yeah. So that number was a combination of restructuring charges and severance charges or repositioning charges and we breakout obviously restructuring so that you can see those.,quarter,Mark Mason,CFO,13,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-15
And this restructuring component was largely driven by the org simplification. That will be done this year.,quarter,Mark Mason,CFO,14,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-15
The normal severance or repositioning charges that we take as a normal course of BAU you would expect that to occur in any year and it certainly will be part of 2025 and 2026 going forward.,quarter,Mark Mason,CFO,14,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-15
"We did have some this quarter. I would expect that we will have some next quarter, but I don't see us being outside of by any stretch the range that I gave and again the range was for the combination of both.",quarter,Mark Mason,CFO,14,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-15
"Okay. Thanks on that. And shifting to the asset cap question, Jane and Mark, we didn't hear a clear answer on, A, do you have an asset cap? And B, even if you don't, what is the effective implication or impact of what the regulators have said?",quarter,Vivek Juneja,Analyst,14,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-15
So let me be crystal clear. We do not have an asset cap and there are no additional measures other than what was announced in July in place and not expecting any.,quarter,Jane Fraser,CEO,14,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-15
"So the implications of what we're doing is as I've laid out, we've increased investments in the areas where we were behind, particularly in the data related to our regulatory processes and regulatory reporting.",quarter,Jane Fraser,CEO,14,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-15
"We're increasing investment behind it. And we continue to make progress, material progress on the orders in place including closing the BSA/AML order this quarter. The third order closed since 2021.",quarter,Jane Fraser,CEO,14,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-15
"And you don't expect anything meaningful, Jane, that will impact business like there was this new story about China, some license that you didn't get approved by the regulators. Anything more meaningful like that that might be occurring that may be...",quarter,Vivek Juneja,Analyst,14,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-15
"Absolutely – let me be crystal clear, absolutely nothing.",quarter,Jane Fraser,CEO,14,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-15
Okay. Great. Thank you.,quarter,Vivek Juneja,Analyst,14,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-15
Our next question will come from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.,quarter,OPERATOR,Other,14,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-15
"Hi. Just a couple of clarification questions. I guess first on Banamex, are you on track to still IPO it the fourth quarter of next year or does it just get pushed out by a quarter with the legal separation taking a little bit longer?",quarter,Matt O'Connor,Analyst,14,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-15
"Look, I think as I mentioned in response to Erika's question, we plan to be ready to IPO at the end of 2025 based on the factors we can control.",quarter,Jane Fraser,CEO,14,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-15
The timing is going to get driven by how we maximize shareholder value and that will be market conditions. So that's where we stand.,quarter,Jane Fraser,CEO,14,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-15
"Okay. I think that means by the end of 2025, you talk about 1Q 2026, that was kind of my clarification question on that. I thought you needed four quarters after you legally separated it to officially IPO it.",quarter,Matt O'Connor,Analyst,14,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-15
We believe as we stand at the moment we would be ready to IPO at the end of 2025.,quarter,Jane Fraser,CEO,14,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-15
"It's much more a focus on what the market conditions at that point will be and Mark and I are very, very much focused on the shareholder value and maximizing that over – rushing over one quarter versus another quarter.",quarter,Jane Fraser,CEO,14,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-15
"And there's no hard rule on – sorry, go ahead.",quarter,Mark Mason,CFO,14,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-15
"Yes, there isn't a hard rule on you have to have got four quarters after you have separated.",quarter,Jane Fraser,CEO,14,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-15
"I see. Okay. That's super helpful. We just haven't had that many of these, so that's helpful.",quarter,Matt O'Connor,Analyst,14,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-15
"And then just separately I think in the prepared remarks you guys mentioned a modest provision within Services for some of the unremitted corporate dividends and I just wanted to clarify that and what country is that. And I guess I thought there wasn't really much liability to you guys from that, so any clarification on that. I know it's a small amount, but that would be helpful. Thank you.",quarter,Matt O'Connor,Analyst,14,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-15
"Sure. It's a small amount. In the back of the deck, we have a page on Russia exposure. It's related to that.",quarter,Mark Mason,CFO,14,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-15
"Okay. But still feel like there's not risk to you guys from all those kind of trapped dividends, I guess why take a small reserve if there's legally no risk to you guys?",quarter,Matt O'Connor,Analyst,14,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-15
"Well, it's the way we treat the exposure there. We're following the guidelines on how we need to treat exposures in the country that we aren't able to distribute to clients but we actually have to hold on their behalf.",quarter,Mark Mason,CFO,15,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-15
And so we have to book a reserve associated with that and so we do that. We obviously show on the page what the exposure is in the event of a loss of control and you can kind of see how that ultimately nets out but we're following the appropriate guidelines for what's required for reserves of that nature.,quarter,Mark Mason,CFO,15,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-15
Got it. Okay. Thank you.,quarter,Matt O'Connor,Analyst,15,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-15
Yeah.,quarter,Mark Mason,CFO,15,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-15
Our next question comes from the line of Ryan Kenny with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.,quarter,OPERATOR,Other,15,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-15
Hey. Thanks for taking my question. I have one for Mark. So you mentioned that Services NII is a tailwind as rates decline. Can you just unpack how that happens? Is there any benefit from swap roll-off or a floating swap that we should be thinking about that's embedded in that statement?,quarter,Ryan Kenny,Analyst,15,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-15
"There are a couple of things kind of to keep in mind on the Services business. So, one is, is obviously this is a client business. It's not just a deposit taking business and so how we think about pricing to those client becomes really important.",quarter,Mark Mason,CFO,15,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-15
"You've got the US and non-US dynamic that's playing through. For institutional clients, we've largely been holding to the higher betas that we saw as rates have ticked up. Again, with the relationship in mind.",quarter,Mark Mason,CFO,15,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-15
And we have some offsetting pressure outside of the US as those betas kind of catch up.,quarter,Mark Mason,CFO,15,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-15
But I think importantly you also heard me mention the reinvestment into securities at higher yields and that reinvestment or those higher yields ultimately play out through the businesses and so that will show up as part of kind of NII as we think about Services but the other businesses as well.,quarter,Mark Mason,CFO,15,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-15
And so those are important components of the NII story for Services.,quarter,Mark Mason,CFO,15,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-15
"I think when you look at the in-quarter performance and [TTS] NII is down 5%, a big part of that is driven by the Argentina rates movement in the quarter versus last year, so lower rates we're earning in Argentina playing through that line particularly in this quarter.",quarter,Mark Mason,CFO,15,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-15
"If you adjusted for that on the NII line, it would be flat to slightly a little bit better.",quarter,Mark Mason,CFO,15,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-15
So that's really what it is. It's kind of management of client relationships as well as the higher earnings on reinvested securities contributing to that as well as volume from operating account growth that we expect.,quarter,Mark Mason,CFO,15,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-15
Thank you.,quarter,Ryan Kenny,Analyst,15,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-15
Our next question comes from the line of Saul Martinez with HSBC. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.,quarter,OPERATOR,Other,15,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-15
"Hey, guys. Couple quick questions. First, just a follow-up on Banamex. Jane, as you know, there are concerns about judicial reform in Mexico and the implications for rule of law and Mexican asset prices have suffered as a result. I think the largest Mexican bank trades at something in the neighborhood of seven times earnings. If market conditions don't improve and Mexican asset prices remain depressed and these concerns persist, then what? I mean, do you just wait until market conditions improve or how do you think about this process in the context of what seems to be a deteriorating macro backdrop for Mexico.",quarter,Saul Martinez,Analyst,15,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-15
"Yeah. We've got to wait and see what the market conditions will be but the North Star for me and for Mark is crystal clear, it is optimizing and maximizing our shareholder value.",quarter,Jane Fraser,CEO,15,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-15
So if the conditions are not appropriate at that time then we will wait until they are.,quarter,Jane Fraser,CEO,15,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-15
"In the meantime, the business is performing well. It's accretive to our returns. It's not a drag here in any shape or form so there is no need to rush for a suboptimal result here.",quarter,Jane Fraser,CEO,15,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-15
"But we will IPO and we will exit Banamex, but we won't do that in a reckless manner.",quarter,Jane Fraser,CEO,15,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-15
We will be disciplined about it as you would expect us to be and as I think we're demonstrating that we are on multiple different dimensions.,quarter,Jane Fraser,CEO,15,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-15
"Okay. Fair enough. And then I guess a follow-up on the US Personal Banking, RoTCE improvement and the normalization of the cost of credit seems to be a big component of that. But Mark can you just remind us where you are in terms of cost of credit versus what you would think a more normalized level is for Branded Cards and Retail Services. I guess how much of a tailwind does a more normalized credit environment entail in terms of credit cost?",quarter,Saul Martinez,Analyst,16,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-15
"Again, I don't want to get into 2025 at this stage. I assure you, we will give more color and commentary on that as we get into the fourth quarter earnings in January.",quarter,Mark Mason,CFO,16,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-15
"What I will say again, as you think about these businesses, we do see continued top line – we do expect continued top line momentum.",quarter,Mark Mason,CFO,16,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-15
"We've had eight consecutive quarters of positive operating leverage in USPB, 49% [efficiency ratio] this quarter. So we're managing the expense base well. We think there's more upside to the top line.",quarter,Mark Mason,CFO,16,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-15
"We're very focused on growth across the portfolios and I do think that cost of credit again, if for no other reason but the compounding effect of those vintages maturing as well as kind of inflation starting to come off, rates trickling down, that should be better for the consumer and should start to play out in both the macroeconomic scenarios that we run for CECL purposes but also ultimately in delinquencies and NCLs and we're starting to see that improvement in delinquencies and its stabilization already somewhat.",quarter,Mark Mason,CFO,16,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-15
So I don't want to get into guidance. But that's kind of how I think about the drivers or contributors to improve returns over the medium term.,quarter,Mark Mason,CFO,16,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-15
Our next question will come from the line of Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.,quarter,OPERATOR,Other,16,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-15
"Hi. Thanks for the clarification on the asset cap question that I asked earlier. And I know you are limited in how much you can say about regulators but just be clear, because a lot of e-mail traffic going back, you did say there is no asset cap and you don't expect one and you don't expect other additional actions at this time?",quarter,Mike Mayo,Analyst,16,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-15
Correct.,quarter,Jane Fraser,CEO,16,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-15
"Okay. Thank you for clarifying that. And I guess, look, I have great respect, I'm an ex-regulator, Paul Volcker was my hero. I respect regulators.",quarter,Mike Mayo,Analyst,16,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-15
And nobody wants to see you cut corners to get to your $51 billion to $53 billion of expenses.,quarter,Mike Mayo,Analyst,16,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-15
"But I'm just wondering – and you have consolidated systems apps, layers, bureaucracy and you're divesting lots of activities.",quarter,Mike Mayo,Analyst,16,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-15
"So it's just even the amended consent order was surprising because you have taken so many efforts and if you should have had an amended consent order or other actions, they probably should have been in place one, five, 10 or literally 20 years ago. And so that's just confusing on the outside.",quarter,Mike Mayo,Analyst,16,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-15
"So with that said, is this a matter of spending more money or about doing these tasks more intelligently?",quarter,Mike Mayo,Analyst,16,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-15
"In other words, you put more gas in the tank, the car's not going faster. So is it amount of resources or just being more intelligent in terms of resolving some of these regulatory issues?",quarter,Mike Mayo,Analyst,16,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-15
"So let me break it down to a couple of pieces. So I start off just remind everyone the consent orders are very, very broad and the action that was taken was because we're behind in a narrower area which is the data particularly regarding our regulatory reporting where we're behind is the main area of focus.",quarter,Jane Fraser,CEO,16,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-15
We moved swiftly to address it. We're very transparent about it from early on in the year that we were falling behind on this and overall I'm pleased with our progress.,quarter,Jane Fraser,CEO,16,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-15
"And as you say, Mike, I listed a number of areas of progress and trying to make it as tangible as we can, given what we can and can't say as this is supervisory.",quarter,Jane Fraser,CEO,16,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-15
"I'm pleased that our businesses continue to improve their performance while the transformation is going on. They're the two priorities we have this year so I think effectively, yes, we can walk and chew gum at the same time and the huge benefit of all of the simplification on the business, on the organization, the other efforts, is making it easier for us to execute and be very focused.",quarter,Jane Fraser,CEO,16,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-15
"And well maybe, Mark, I’ll pass it over to you.",quarter,Jane Fraser,CEO,16,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-15
"I think your question's helpful in the sense that you said is it kind of a rethink on our approach or is it the need to spend more money and one of the things that we've done, Mike, is take a step back and look at how we've been approaching data, for example.",quarter,Mark Mason,CFO,17,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-15
"So this is – and we are going to make – we have made some changes to our approach and those changes relate to how we get after resolving data issues that are identified ensuring that there's engagement from the front end business, from the functions that are most relevant and that there's consideration for what's required on reg reporting in order for us to get that process streamlined and correct.",quarter,Mark Mason,CFO,17,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-15
"And so there are aspects of this that require a change in our approach and we've been taking that change, making that change rather, and we'll make more changes accordingly as we've taken that step back and there are aspects of it that require at a minimum review of what is causing either the delay or us not moving at the pace that we would like to move or that our regulators would like.",quarter,Mark Mason,CFO,17,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-15
And that is in fact what the resource review plan was that was in the amended consent order. It was basically a statement saying that you need to ensure that you have sufficient resources and that they're allocated towards achieving the timely and sustainable compliance.,quarter,Mark Mason,CFO,17,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-15
"And so part of our process is in fact that. Taking a regular review of what is on track in the way of our milestones and deliverables where we see things that are being delayed or going red, what is the underlying root cause for why.",quarter,Mark Mason,CFO,17,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-15
"Is it a resource issue where we need to put more dollars and people or technology to it? Is it a process issue where we need to reconsider our approach? And on the other side of that root cause, taking action to fix it.",quarter,Mark Mason,CFO,17,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-15
"And so your question is spot-on. The answer is that in many instances it will be a little bit of both, but importantly our processes include that type of analysis and assessment so that we can get after the execution on this in an effective way. I hope that helps.",quarter,Mark Mason,CFO,17,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-15
And all of this drives productivity and other benefits for our shareholders as well as making sure that we're strengthening Citi from the regulatory perspective.,quarter,Jane Fraser,CEO,17,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-15
"And then last follow-up. To the extent that you see a disconnect between your performance and the stock price that would seem to create more of an opportunity to buy the stock at $64 when tangible book value is $90. And so, I hope that – I've used this analogy before, but hopefully you're selling the chairs and the desk and the silverware in the executive dining room to go ahead and buy back stock whenever you can.",quarter,Mike Mayo,Analyst,17,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-15
"It's clearly given where we are trading, we're very focused around the opportunities to buy back stock and mindful of the importance of it and equally, yes, we are proud of the performance of the franchise this quarter.",quarter,Jane Fraser,CEO,17,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-15
It was a very strong quarter and important set of proof points for our investors. We are on a deliberate path.,quarter,Jane Fraser,CEO,17,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-15
We're making the progress that we need to and actually pretty excited about the path ahead of us and the potential that we see.,quarter,Jane Fraser,CEO,17,Q and A,Q3_2024,2024-10-15
There are no further questions. I'll now turn the call over to Jenn Landis for closing remarks.,quarter,OPERATOR,Other,17,Conclusion,Q3_2024,2024-10-15
