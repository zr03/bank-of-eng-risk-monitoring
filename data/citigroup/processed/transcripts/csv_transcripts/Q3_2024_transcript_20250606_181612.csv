Citigroup,Third,JENNIFER LANDIS,OTHER,"Thank you, operator. Good morning and thank you all for joining our third quarter 2024
earnings call. I am joined today by our Chief Executive Officer, Jane Fraser, and our Chief Financial Officer,
Mark Mason.
I'd like to remind you that today's presentation, which is available for download on our website,
citigroup.com, may contain forward-looking statements which are based on management's current
expectations and are subject to uncertainty and changes in circumstances. Actual results may differ
materially from these statements due to a variety of factors, including those described in our earnings
materials as well as in our SEC filings.
And with that, I'll turn it over to Jane.",109,1,2,0.6,opening_remarks
Citigroup,Third,JANE FRASER,OTHER,"Thank you, Jenn, and a very good morning to everyone. Well, we certainly live in interesting
times. And while I usually start our calls with our views on the global macro environment, we are particularly
proud of our progress this quarter, and so I shall start there. Indeed, in a pivotal year, this quarter contains
multiple proof points that we are moving in the right direction and that our strategy is delivering concrete
results.
We saw revenue growth and positive operating leverage for the firm and across all five businesses. Our
businesses performed well as the rate cutting cycle began, with a double-digit increase in fee-based
revenues, reflecting the growing diversity of our earnings mix. We continue to have share gains in Services
and Banking. In Wealth, we saw a sizeable increase in client investments and flows. We brought expenses
down whilst continuing to invest in our transformation. And we continued to attract top leaders in the
industry and successfully combine them with our own teams in Banking and Wealth. So, while we are not yet
where we want to be, the impact of the changes we are making is clearly evident in our momentum and
improving performance.
Turning to the macro, now while growth is a notch slower than last year, global economic performance
continues to be surprisingly resilient. Whatever you want to call the US landing, the sentiment around it is
more optimistic, supported by the recent positive payrolls report. And we see a healthy yet more discerning
US consumer, and a US corporate sector on its front foot. Manufacturing weakness is restraining a modest
rebound in Europe which continues to struggle with more structural challenges around its competitiveness,
as highlighted by Draghi’s report. In China, consumer sentiment and the property market remain a concern
as markets await details on the expected fiscal stimulus. India, Asean, Japan, the Middle East, Mexico and
Brazil are all notable global bright spots.

Citi Third Quarter 2024 Earnings Call
October 15, 2024
Today we reported net income of $3.2 billion and earnings per share of $1.51 with an ROTCE of 7%. Overall
revenues grew by 3% ex-divestitures, with each of our core businesses delivering growth and positive
operating leverage. While we continue to make substantial investments in our transformation, the
efficiencies gained from our simplification and other efforts drove a 2% reduction in overall expenses.
Turning to the five businesses, Services delivered a record quarter with revenues up by 8%. Fee growth, the
best indicator of underlying momentum, was significant. And this, combined with loan and deposit volume
growth, drove this quarter’s excellent performance. Treasury and Trade Solutions was up 4% year over year
reflecting good underlying momentum in the core drivers. And Securities Services was up 24%, reflecting the
benefit of new mandates and an increase in assets under custody. Both TTS and Securities Services
achieved over 10% wallet share in our target markets through the first half of the year.
Last week we announced that we are the first global bank to complete the integration of our cross-border
services with Mastercard Move. Now, this will ultimately enable near-instant, secure payments to the vast
Mastercard debit network, starting with 14 markets with more to come early next year. And this is another
great example of our continued investment in market-leading product innovations.
In Markets, revenues were up slightly on the back of a better-than- expected September. Equities was up
32% with robust performance across all products. Our continued strong performance in Equities validates
both our strategy and execution to grow Prime and Cash. Fixed Income however was down 6% — our Rates
and Currencies business didn’t match last year’s standout performance.
It was a particularly pleasing quarter in Banking. Despite the muted IPO market, Investment Banking fees
are up 44% driven by investment grade debt issuance as our clients pulled forward activity ahead of the U.S.
election. Corporate sentiment remains positive as boards pursue strategic transactions, such as the $36
billion Mars acquisition of Kellanova, where we are the sole advisor and lead financier. Our strategy in
Banking continues to gain momentum, and we are steadily growing our share in key target sectors such as
healthcare and tech, with a healthy pipeline ahead. And the significant upside of our franchise continues to
attract the top talent to Citi.
During the quarter, we announced an innovative $25 billion private credit partnership with our longtime
client Apollo, giving us the ability to source new transactions without using our balance sheet. This
partnership positions us with another solution for debt financing for our clients, and it allow us to engage in
private credit with the same depth and expertise as we currently do with syndicated debt markets.
We are also starting to see the positive impact of the significant changes we’ve implemented in our Wealth
franchise, with revenues up 9%. It’s a notable example of the traction I referenced earlier. As Andy and the
team intensify the focus on our investments business, we grew client investment assets by 24%. And we
were particularly pleased with the performance in Asia and in Citigold. I continue to be excited by the
opportunities and the sheer potential of our franchise.
During the quarter, we signed an agreement to exit trust administration and fiduciary services as we continue
to sharpen the focus of our Wealth business. We have more to do to reach our medium-term margin and
returns targets, but this quarter is a good indicator that we are on the way there.
U.S. Personal Banking revenues were up 3%. We grew Branded Cards revenues by 8% with account
acquisitions, spend and payment rates all driving higher interest-earning balances. Lower discretionary
spending is impacting our Retail Services portfolio; however, we continue to see lower payment rates
contributing to interest earning balances. In Retail Banking, we are growing our mortgage portfolio as the
rate environment shifts, as well as growing overall loans.
The U.S. consumer dynamics remain remarkably consistent with prior quarters. Our customers are healthy
but more discerning in their spend, with signs of stress isolated to the lower FICOs. We have maintained
strong credit discipline, and our card portfolios continue to perform very much in line with our expectations.
In terms of capital, while uncertainty about the Basel 3 endgame prevails, our capital position remains very
robust, and we ended the quarter with a CET1 ratio of 13.7%. During the quarter, we returned $2.1 billion in

Citigroup,Third,MARK MASON,OTHER,"Thanks, Jane and good morning, everyone. I am going to start with the firmwide financial
results, focusing on year-over-year comparisons for the third quarter unless I indicate otherwise, and then
spend a little more time on the businesses.
On slide 5, we show financial results for the full firm. For the quarter, we reported net income of
approximately $3.2 billion, EPS of $1.51 and an RoTCE of 7.0% on $20.3 billion of revenues. Total revenues
were up 1% on a reported basis. Excluding divestiture-related impacts, revenues were up 3%, driven by
growth across each of our businesses. As you can see on the bottom left side of the page, net interest income
excluding Markets was down 1% YoY, largely due to lower interest rates in Argentina. And non-interest
revenue excluding Markets was up 9% as we continued to see strong fee momentum across Services,
Banking and Wealth. Year-to-date, revenues are up 1% on a reported basis, and are up 3% excluding
divestiture-related impacts. Expenses were $13.3 billion, down 2%, largely driven by savings associated with
our organizational simplification and stranded cost reductions, partially offset by volume related expenses
and continued investments in the Transformation and other risk and control initiatives. Year-to-date,
expenses are up 1%, primarily driven by the FDIC special assessment and civil money penalties. Cost of credit
was $2.7 billion, largely driven by net credit losses in Cards as well as ACL builds across the businesses,
primarily for portfolio growth and mix. At the end of the quarter, we had over $22 billion in total reserves with
a reserve-to-funded loans ratio of approximately 2.7%. And year-to-date, excluding the divesture related
impacts, we generated positive operating leverage for the firm, and reported an RoTCE of 7.2%.
On slide 6, we show the expense trend over the past five quarters. This quarter we reported expenses of $13.3
billion, down 2%, and 1% sequentially. As we’ve said before, we will continue to increase our investments to
address data governance and data quality related to regulatory reporting and are committed to spending
whatever is necessary to address these areas and the Transformation more broadly. Although a lot more
work remains, we have started to see benefits from our prior investments play through. We’ve continued to
simplify our technology infrastructure, retiring over 450 applications year-to-date and now over 1,250 since
our 2022 Investor Day. We’ve upgraded 100% of our over 2,300 ATMs in North America and Asia Pacific to
next-gen software for better customer security and monitoring. And we have streamlined our cloud
onboarding process, reducing time to onboard applications to the public cloud from over 7 weeks to 2 weeks.
Each of these initiatives will result in both improvement of our operating efficiency and our safety and
soundness. And in terms of our full year expenses, we continue to expect that we will be at the higher end of
the guidance range of $53.5 to 53.8 billion, excluding the FDIC special assessment and civil money penalties.
And as we’ve said before, we, of course, will continue to look for opportunities to absorb the civil money
penalties.
On slide 7, we show net interest income, loans and deposits where I’ll speak to sequential variances. In the
third quarter, net interest income declined 1%. Excluding Markets, net interest income was up 4%, largely
driven by volume growth in USPB as well as higher deposit spreads in Services and Wealth. NIM declined by

8 basis points, driven by a decline in Markets due to seasonally higher dividends in the second quarter.
Average loans were up 1%, driven by growth in Services and USPB, partially offset by modest declines in
Banking and Legacy Franchises. Average deposits were roughly flat, as growth in Services was largely offset
by a decline in Legacy Franchises. And as you think about guidance for NII ex-Markets in the fourth quarter:
As short-end rates continue to come down, we expect a headwind on floating-rate assets which will be
somewhat offset by disciplined deposit pricing. Further offsetting that will be a continued benefit from
securities being reinvested at higher yields. And as a reminder, we expect an ongoing NII headwind as Legacy
Franchises’ loans and deposits continue to come down. So, taking all of this into account, we expect NII ex-
Markets to be roughly flat sequentially in the fourth quarter, and for the full year to be slightly down, better
than we had previously guided.
On slide 8, we show key consumer and corporate credit metrics, which reflect our disciplined risk appetite
framework. Across our Cards portfolio, approximately 85% of our loans are to consumers with FICO scores
of 660 or higher. Based on what we see, the US consumer continues to remain healthy and resilient. Spend
and payment rates continue to normalize, and underlying credit performance remains broadly in line with
our expectations. NCLs increased year-over-year as card loan vintages that were originated over the last few
years continue to mature at the same time. Sequentially, NCLs declined while delinquencies increased, both
in-line with historical third quarter seasonality. Absent this seasonality, we continue to see stabilization in
early-stage delinquencies. We remain well reserved with a reserve-to-funded loan ratio of approximately
8.2% for our U.S. Cards portfolio. Our Corporate portfolio is largely investment grade and corporate non-
accrual loans remained low, at 31 basis points. As such, we feel very comfortable with the over $22 billion of
total reserves that we have in the current environment.
Turning to slide 9, we provide details on our balance sheet, capital and liquidity, which are a reflection of our
risk appetite, strategy and business model. Our $1.3 trillion deposit base is well-diversified across regions,
industries, customers and account types. $840 billion are corporate, spanning 90 countries, and are crucial
to how our clients fund their daily operations around the world. The majority of our remaining deposits,
about $400 billion, are well-diversified across the Private Bank, Citigold, Retail and Wealth at Work
offerings. And of our total deposits, roughly 70% are US dollar denominated with the remainder spanning
over 60 currencies. Our asset mix also reflects our strong risk appetite framework. Our $689 billion loan
portfolio is well-diversified across consumer and corporate loans. In the quarter, deposit growth outpaced
loan growth resulting in higher cash balances which contributed to available liquidity resources of
approximately $960 billion. We continue to feel very good about the strength of our balance sheet and the
quality of our assets and liabilities, which position us well to serve our clients and execute on our growth
strategy.
On slide 10, we show the sequential CET1 walk to provide more detail on the drivers this quarter. First, we
generated $3.0 billion of net income to common shareholders, which added 27 basis points. Second, we
returned $2.1 billion in the form of common dividends and share repurchases, which drove a reduction of 18
basis points. Third, we generated 12 basis points from unrealized AFS gains. And finally, the remaining 9
basis point reduction was driven by an increase in RWA as we continue to invest in accretive growth
opportunities. We ended the third quarter with a preliminary CET1 capital ratio of 13.7% relative to our target
of 13.3%. As a reminder, effective October 1st, our new CET1 capital ratio requirement is 12.1%, and we still
plan on holding a 100 basis point management buffer on top of that for now. As we think about the coming
quarters, there are a few things that we will continue to consider as we manage our capital levels, including
client demand as well as how the macro and Basel 3 Endgame evolves. We will take all of this into account
as it relates to capital levels and the level of share repurchases on a quarter-by-quarter basis.
Turning to the businesses on slide 11. In Services, revenues were up 8%, reflecting continued momentum
across Securities Services and TTS, both of which continue to gain share through the first half of this year.
Net interest income was roughly flat, as the benefit of higher deposit volumes was largely offset by a decline
in interest rates in Argentina. On a sequential basis, net interest income was up 7%, driven by volume growth
as we continue to onboard high-quality operating deposits and the benefit from higher deposit spreads.
Non-interest revenue increased 33%, driven by a smaller impact from currency devaluation in Argentina as

October 15, 2024
well as continued strength in underlying fee drivers in TTS and Securities Services. Excluding the impact of
the Argentine Peso devaluation, NIR increased 11%, driven by growth in cross border transactions, US Dollar
Clearing volumes and Commercial Card volumes. Expenses increased 3%, primarily driven by investments in
technology, other risk and controls and product innovation, including the expansion of the CitiDirect
Commercial Banking platform into additional markets. Cost of credit was $127 million, primarily driven by a
build related to unremittable corporate dividends being held on behalf of clients. Average loans increased
5% primarily driven by continued demand for export and agency finance as well as working capital loans.
Average deposits increased 4% as we continue to see growth in operating deposits. Services generated
positive operating leverage and delivered net income of approximately $1.7 billion. And continues to deliver
a high RoTCE, coming in at 26.4% for the quarter and 24.7% year-to-date.
On slide 12, we show the results for Markets for the third quarter. Markets revenues were up 1%, driven by
growth in Equities, partially offset by a decline in Fixed Income. Equities revenues increased 32%, driven by
momentum in Prime with balances up approximately 22%, growth in Derivatives and higher Cash volumes.
Fixed Income revenues decreased 6%, driven by Rates and Currencies, which was down 10%, partially offset
by Spread Products and Other Fixed Income, which was up 5%. While Rates and Currencies declined from
last year, which was the strongest third quarter in the previous 10 years, we did see good momentum in FX
from increased corporate client activity. Spread Products and Other Fixed Income was higher driven by
Financing and Securitization volumes and underwriting fees, partially offset by lower Commodities on lower
gas volatility. Expenses increased 1% primarily due to higher volume related expenses. Cost of credit was
$141 million, driven by an ACL build primarily related to portfolio mix in Spread Products. Average loans
increased 10%, largely driven by asset-backed lending in Spread Products as well as margin loans in Equities.
Average trading account assets increased 18%, largely driven by client demand for US Treasuries, foreign
government securities and mortgage-backed securities. Markets generated another quarter of positive
operating leverage and delivered net income of approximately $1.1 billion with an RoTCE of 7.9% for the
quarter and 9.7% year-to-date.
On slide 13, we show the results for Banking for the third quarter. Banking revenues were up 16%, largely
driven by growth in Investment Banking. Investment Banking revenues were up 31% and fees were up 44%,
with increases across Debt Capital Markets, Advisory and Equity Capital Markets. DCM benefited from
continued strong Investment Grade issuance. Advisory benefited from strong announced deal volume earlier
this year. And in ECM we saw stronger follow-on activity, which was offset by fewer IPOs amid market
volatility in August. Both year-to-date and in the quarter, we’ve driven wallet share gains, including in the
Healthcare and Technology sectors where we’ve been investing. Corporate Lending revenues, excluding
mark-to-market on loan hedges, increased 5%, primarily driven by a smaller impact from currency
devaluation in Argentina. Expenses decreased 9%, primarily driven by benefits of headcount reductions as
we continued to right size the workforce and expense base. Cost of credit was $177 million, driven by an ACL
build primarily for portfolio mix changes. Average loans decreased 1% as we maintained strict discipline
around returns. Banking generated positive operating leverage for the third quarter in a row and delivered
net income of $238 million with an RoTCE of 4.3% for the quarter and 7.2% year-to-date.
On slide 14, we show the results for Wealth for the third quarter. As you can see from our performance this
quarter, we are making good progress against our strategy and expect that momentum to continue. Revenue
was up 9%, driven by a 15% increase in NIR as we grew investment fee revenues on momentum in client
investment assets, which grew 24%. NII increased 6% driven by higher deposit volumes and spreads.
Expenses decreased 4%, driven by the continued benefits of headcount reductions as we right size the
workforce and expense base. Cost of credit was $33 million, largely driven by net credit losses of $27 million.
End-of-period client balances increased 14%, driven by higher client investment assets and deposits, both
in North America and internationally. Average deposits increased 4%, reflecting the transfer of relationships
and the associated deposits from USPB, partially offset by a shift in deposits to higher-yielding investments
on Citi’s platform. Average loans decreased 1%, as we continued to optimize capital usage. Wealth generated
another quarter of positive operating leverage and delivered net income of $283 million with an RoTCE of
8.5% for the quarter and 6.8% year-to-date.

come from Glenn Schorr with Evercore. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.",30,6,8,0.6,qa_session
Citigroup,Third,GLENN SCHORR,OTHER,"Hi. Thanks very much. Good guidance. I appreciate it. I'm curious on the card losses in
Retail financial services, if you could talk to like, the 2024 exit rate seems like it will be higher than the full
year guide at 6.25%. Maybe you could talk to the trajectory there and then the huge reserves that you have
built in there and anything you can tell us about the portfolios so we can keep expectations in the right spot.
Thanks.",80,6,9,0.6,opening_remarks
Citigroup,Third,MARK MASON,OTHER,"Yeah, sure. Why don't I take that. Good morning, Glenn. So a couple things. So, one, I think
that on Retail Services you're seeing a couple of things kind of play out. So, one, you're seeing kind of spend
volumes trend down a bit. You are seeing payment rates come down as well. That obviously is fueling the
average interest earning balance growth that we're seeing. And then you are also seeing with the spend
volume come down, there's a denominator effect that plays through which pushes up obviously the loss
rates that we're seeing. That still in the quarter is in line with our guidance but in light of what we saw earlier
in the year and normal seasonality, we would expect that number to be on the higher end of that range and
likely higher in the fourth quarter, but the higher in the fourth quarter again depends on what traffic is like
and what the holiday spending season looks like through the end of the year.
I would say the reserve levels we have are very healthy as it relates to this portfolio. I think in the back of the
deck we show kind of the reserve to loan ratio at about 11.7% or so. So well-reserved for the Retail Services
portfolio in light of the environment that we're in.
Similarly, we are seeing the stabilization from a delinquency point of view across both portfolios kind of play

Citigroup,Third,GLENN SCHORR,OTHER,"Okay. Thanks for all that, Mark. Just one quickie On your partnership with Apollo, very
interesting and in line with a lot of other things we've seen. Curious on how you thought about going with
one specific partner versus a group and then more importantly, are there other parts of the franchise that
could benefit with stronger ties to private markets, I'm thinking specifically in the asset-backed world.
Appreciate it. Thank you.",72,7,11,0.6,opening_remarks
Citigroup,Third,JANE FRASER,OTHER,"So we're delighted to partner with Apollo because what this does is it's uniting our
comprehensive banking reach and expertise together and it's enabling us to offer our clients more innovative
and tailored financing solutions. There will be some other partners involved in this as well. Mubadala is
another participant in this.
And when we look at this, it's very, very beneficial for our clients. We're always looking at how we can best
serve our clients, give them the most options and this platform enhances corporate and sponsor clients
access to the private lending capital pool at real scale in $25 billion is a very sizable partnership here and it
provides funding certainty and strategic transactions.
It's exclusive for LBOs, non-investment grade in the US. The US is obviously the bulk of the private credit
market, it’s the behemoth globally. It would be great to see that market developing in Europe and it wouldn't
surprise me to see us doing more partnerships and other pieces going forward.",167,7,12,0.6,general_discussion
Citigroup,Third,OPERATOR,MODERATOR,"Our next question will come from Ebrahim Poonawala with Bank of America. Your line is now
open. Please go ahead.",20,7,13,0.6,qa_session
Citigroup,Third,EBRAHIM POONAWALA,OTHER,"Good morning. I guess maybe, Mark, for you, like looking at slide 7 on NII, and
maybe we can break it down into Markets and ex-Markets. In the ex-Markets NII, $11.96 billion this quarter,
based on what you've said, the back book repricing, deposit flex, is it safe to conclude that the ex-Markets
NII bottomed in 2Q 2024? And I noticed the securities yield actually went lower, 7 bps quarter-over-quarter.
So was there something one-off that impacted the yield this quarter relative to the expectations you outlined
earlier?",88,7,14,0.6,opening_remarks
Citigroup,Third,MARK MASON,OTHER,"So when you look at slide 7, you got a couple of things playing through. So your point around
the low number, the low print, $11.46 billion in the second quarter, that really is a combination relative to first
quarter of FX translation, some seasonally lower card balances, and lower interest payments in Argentina
playing through that sequential 1Q to 2Q.
The third quarter, as I mentioned earlier, is really a by-product of volumes on the lending side and spreads,
deposit spreads in Services and Wealth and I think that I've already given kind of the guide for the fourth
quarter where that is likely to be flat. But I think it's important to just remind everyone of the headwinds and
tailwinds that play through this NII line. And from a tailwind point of view, I would expect to see continued
volume from loans, USPB in particular but also Services and we're talking ex-Markets, so Services. I'd also
expect to see continued benefit from the reinvestment of securities at higher yields and then we're actively
managing beta as it relates to with our clients and if you think about kind of what we saw in the uptick of
rates, we're actively managing that on the down tick as it relates to our institutional clients.
I think the other point here is let's not forget that our interest rate sensitivity skews more towards non-US
and so a lot of what we think about and talk about tends to be how US rates move and the betas around that.
We're still going to have a bit of beta catch-up outside of the US and so that's one of the headwinds there as
well as the Legacy Franchise exits.
So you've got this long-winded way of saying, I do expect flat into the fourth quarter. I'm not going to give
guidance for 2025. But what I will say is to keep the growth momentum to get to our medium-term targets,
that's 4% to 5% of a CAGR and that's going to be a combination of NII and NIR but skewing NIR. And I want
to point that out because the third quarter and the year-to-date numbers that you see in our performance

Citigroup,Third,EBRAHIM POONAWALA,OTHER,"That's helpful. And agreed on the fee momentum. Just one quick on the Wealth
segment. We've seen a considerable progress year-to-date in terms of going from zero ROE to about 8.5%
RoTCE, significant operating leverage. I think I heard Jane say that momentum should continue. Is it fair to
assume that RoTCE remains, like Wealth remains a positive story as we think about how Citi's ROE continues
to improve from here as we get towards the target? Any color on the Wealth side would be helpful. Thank
you.",88,8,16,0.6,opening_remarks
Citigroup,Third,JANE FRASER,OTHER,"Yes, I agree with you. I think we're all very pleased to see the progress on the strategy we laid
out at Investor Day. The Wealth target we have in the medium term is 15% to 20% and with that a 25% to
30% operating margin and we're making steady progress there. I think the first piece was putting the pieces
of the global wealth organization together and now we're focused on positioning for growth and reshaping
the business to deliver the returns that we all expect.
A very important part of that is shifting our mix by growing investments. We had 24% growth in client
investment assets this quarter. I would call that a good start to realizing the potential that we have here. And
at the same time, Andy continues to right-size our expense base and drive productivity. Our advisor
productivity increased over 50% in Citigold North America. So a number of different areas that he's focused
on so that we can continue to grow the investment space including some important new talent that we've
been bringing in that I'm sure you've noticed.",185,8,17,0.6,guidance
Citigroup,Third,OPERATOR,MODERATOR,"Our next question will come from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open. Please go
ahead.",19,8,18,0.6,qa_session
Citigroup,Third,MIKE MAYO,OTHER,"Hi. What assurance can you give that Citi can both meet its 2026 expense guide, the $51 billion
to $53 billion and I note the year-to-date run rate implies $54 billion. So getting from that $54 billion run
rate down to the $51 billion to $53 billion by 2026 and meet its regulatory targets. In other words, assurance
that Citi can both walk and chew gum at the same time. And I guess I'd highlight as you know, on October 2
Senator Warren asked the OCC to impose growth restrictions because Citi is ""too big to manage."" I would
assume you don't agree with that, but still the question that a lot of people have is what assurances can you
give that an asset cap won't happen at Citigroup? Thanks.",130,8,19,0.6,opening_remarks
Citigroup,Third,MARK MASON,OTHER,"Thanks, Mike. So why don't I start with your expense question and I'm sure Jane will chime
in on some of the other parts of your question. So, look, we put out medium term targets of $51 billion to $53
billion in 2026, revenue dependent, of course, and that's consistent with the target we gave of less than 60%
efficiency ratio. And we've got a target this year as you know on the high end of $53.8 billion [ex-FDIC special
assessment and Civil Money Penalties]. And so we've got to get from $53.8 billion down to $51 billion to $53
billion by 2026. I'm not giving guidance for 2025 but you can expect that that will likely glide down to that
number.
What's driving the reduction? So we've talked before about $1.5 billion in savings largely related to the
restructuring and driving down headcount reduction associated with that. We talked about another $500
million to $1 billion related to expense reductions from eliminating stranded cost as we continue to exit.
We're out of nine of these consumer countries already. And we talk about starting to see efficiencies and
benefits from the investments and the transformation and technology towards the end of 2026. And those
are the three drivers that are important for us to continue to realize between now and 2026.
Will there be headwinds? Yes. There will be, the transformation is a multiyear process. We're also investing
in risk controls and regulatory spend to support improving our operations. Of course, there will be headwinds
but there will also be things that we shift away from. There will be tailwinds associated with it. Jane
mentioned some of the productivity efforts that both Andy as well as Vis are pushing on. You look across

Citigroup,Third,JANE FRASER,OTHER,"And, Mike, let me pick up on part of the second part of the question in terms of the progress
on the transformation. As you know, and as Mark's talked to you about, the transformation reverses historic
underinvestment in Citi's infrastructure. It enhances our risk and control environment. And it's a strategic
overhaul as we've talked about that goes well beyond the consent order to simplify and to strengthen Citi to
the benefit of all of the stakeholders we have.
We are already a very different Citi today. We've made enormous change over the past three years,
dramatically simpler business model, significant org change so we align our structure to that model. We now
have a flatter organization with greater accountability and as Mark talked about through the investments in
our transformation, we're focused on simplifying our operational model, modernizing our infrastructure risk
and controls and all of that reduces risk as we go.
We're well on the way in executing the transformation plans. We've made meaningful progress as was
acknowledged publicly by one of our regulators and it's a wide range book of work. We've made significant
strides in areas such as risk management, compliance and accountability and that's well beyond the big
bodies of work about consolidating our platforms. So we had 1,250 retired since 2022 as Mark mentioned.
Other areas of progress, enhance our stress testing capabilities, they're faster, more frequent, more precise
assessments. We put in place new target operating models for wholesale credit risk, enterprise risk, price risk
firm wide. A huge body of work reducing risk and high risk processes such as payments and Markets through
systemic preventative controls. We've been implementing the XiNG platform, this is the strategic cloud
solution for market risk analytics. Values trades on demand and at scale. And we've embedded risk and
controls into our performance management framework and tied that to compensation for the full firm. So
these are just giving you a flavor of these big body of work that we are executing and getting done.
I was very pleased that we closed the FRB, AML/BSA consent order particularly given heightened risk and
scrutiny in this area. That is the third consent order we've closed since 2021 and we've been very transparent.
Where there are areas in which our execution is delayed against our original timelines as is the case with our
data work. We take a step back, determine what we need to change in those areas and get back on track and
make relevant tech and people investments. So I feel very confident about the strategy we've laid out for the
firm, the deliberate path we're on, the huge progress we've already made, and that we will continue making
with determination and with clarity going forward.",461,9,21,0.6,qa_session
Citigroup,Third,MIKE MAYO,OTHER,"So, just one follow-up. When, and you do have the amended consent order that's not new
anymore, but is this a problem with your dealing with clients or is this an issue with giving the regulators the
information that they need? And just again, you don't, just to confirm, you don't have an asset cap now, is it
fair to assume that you don't expect an asset cap any time soon or could you have an asset cap and we don't
even know about that? Thanks.",86,9,22,0.6,opening_remarks
Citigroup,Third,JANE FRASER,OTHER,"We don't have any problems dealing with our clients, quite the opposite. We're a source of
strength for our clients in terms of the provision of their payments businesses, their trading businesses, their
consumer credit businesses, all across the board. So I would say quite the opposite. We are a source of
tremendous strength for them and you see that in the results of this quarter which were very pleasing across
the board in every single one of our businesses.
We are working closely with our regulators. We incorporate their feedback as well as our own lessons learned.
If we fall behind in an element of the consent orders but do understand the breadth of the consent order
work as I laid out and the meaningful progress we're making across multiple areas, and when we fall behind
in an area we increase the investments needed and look at any lessons learned in the approach and address
it. So I feel very comfortable.",162,9,23,0.6,general_discussion

Citigroup,Third,OPERATOR,MODERATOR,"Our next question will come from Jim Mitchell with Seaport Global. Your line is now open. Please
go ahead.",19,10,25,0.6,qa_session
Citigroup,Third,JIM MITCHELL,OTHER,"Hey, good morning. Mark, consensus expectations, and it's just another expense question in
a different way. But consensus has you not hitting your revenue growth targets and you're certainly free to
disagree and I think that's fine. But they also have your expenses at the high end of your $51 billion to $53
billion range in 2026. I guess, does that make sense or do you feel confident that if revenues do sort of
disappoint your targets that you could come in at the – you should or can come in at the lower end of that
range to help get to your RoTCE target.",105,10,26,0.6,opening_remarks
Citigroup,Third,MARK MASON,OTHER,"Yeah. So, let's take it in pieces. So I think – the first thing is that, I think Jane and I have been
very consistent with trying to give guidance on full year performance for the past couple years and we've
largely actually delivered on that guidance. If you look at the top line growth since Investor Day, it's largely
consistent with what we talked about in the medium term. If you look at the expense guidance that we've
given, largely consistent with that including this year. Even as I look at the $80 billion to $81 billion revenue
guidance we gave for the year, and you look at the $60.6 billion that we've done year-to-date, and you think
about what we have to deliver in order to hit that target, that is achievable particularly when you remember
that we had a large Argentina devaluation last year. That fee momentum required in the fourth quarter is very
achievable and we believe that we will obviously hit the high end of the [expense] range for 2024.
As I think about that outer year period and the guidance that we gave there, look, you all want proof points
before you actually believe that we can deliver on that medium term target. I'm pointing you to proof points.
I'm hopeful that as you see those proof points through 2024, full year and each of the quarters, that you will
start to believe in that revenue momentum that's required in the medium term. The fee revenue is a very good
indicator. What we delivered this year and this quarter is a very good indicator of the momentum we should
see across these businesses in the next couple years.
I also hope that you would then see that as we deliver on the expense target that we have a path to continuing
to deliver on the medium-term expense target, the drivers of which I mentioned earlier. Yes, if revenues come
in short of the target that we've set for ourselves, you would naturally expect for the volume and transaction
related expenses and compensation expenses to come down in a commensurate way with that revenue
decline and you would also expect that we would look to see if there are other productivity opportunities that
we can tease out in order to still deliver on that operating efficiency target that we've set for ourselves.",397,10,27,0.6,financial_results
Citigroup,Third,JIM MITCHELL,OTHER,"No, that's great color. I appreciate it. And maybe just as a follow-up on the capital question,
I guess one thing that's been a bit of a headwind over the last year has been sort of growth from the DTA
deductions. Do we start to see that become a tailwind again? How do we think about that accreting back
into capital over the next couple of years?",67,10,28,0.6,qa_session
Citigroup,Third,MARK MASON,OTHER,"Yeah. Look, the main driver of our DTA utilization will be driving higher income in the US.
That's going to be the major driver and as we think about – so as you think about each of the strategies that
Jane has described for our business, you will often hear the importance of winning in the US. You'll hear it as
it relates to Banking and the activity that we saw, the strong performance we saw this quarter in Vis’s world,
you hear it as it relates to the Wealth business and the importance of us growing investments particularly in
North America.

Citigroup,Third,OPERATOR,MODERATOR,"Our next question will come from Erika Najarian with UBS. Your line is now open. Please go
ahead.",18,11,30,0.6,qa_session
Citigroup,Third,ERIKA NAJARIAN,OTHER,"Hi. I think we've slid over to the afternoon. Good afternoon, guys. The first one is for you,
Jane. As I speak with longer term investors, they often offer the commentary that clearly the path from the
7% RoTCE this quarter to the 11% to 12% hopefully will be bridged and to be able to initiate a position before
that progress is made, they really sort of want to see more capital optimization. And this question is not really
the same question I ask you about buybacks every quarter but really maybe a progress update on Banamex.
So there is chatter in the market about Banamex needed to have four quarters of separate financials before
being IPOed and I'm wondering if you could give us specific progress on how that's going? And Mark, maybe
remind us on what Banamex's contribution is as we think about the unlocking that excess capital versus
taking it out of the P&L.",157,11,31,0.6,opening_remarks
Citigroup,Third,JANE FRASER,OTHER,"Yeah. I'd be delighted to, Erika. And I would also just before I jump into Banamex point to a
laser focus on capital optimization. It's been a mantra for a long time in our Markets business, in Banking and
a discipline that we've driven throughout the organization and I would say there isn't anyone at Citi that is
not keenly aware of the focus around optimizing our capital.
Returning to shareholders, particularly given where we're trading, and making sure that we drive to returns.
So if I turn to Banamex, our singular focus right now is the separation of the two banks which we expect to
complete in the fourth quarter of this year. This has been an enormous body of work because we are creating
effectively de novo Mexico's eighth largest bank. We've just now gotten the core regulatory authorizations
that we need to proceed with separation. Although there are a few other approvals pending. We are in the
very final stages and are working with our clients to prepare them for this switchover later on in Q4.
Once the separation is complete, we will turn our full attention to the IPO itself and the successful execution
of the IPO is the highest priority for our Head of International, Ernesto Torres Cantú, to run Banamex. And
our incoming Banamex Executive Chairman who starts this quarter, Ignacio Deschamps. We plan to be ready
to IPO at the end of 2025 based on the factors that we can control but I think as Mark and I have always said,
the timing is going to be driven by market conditions to ensure we maximize the shareholder value.
And we're making the necessary investments to continue growing share and I was very pleased that
Banamex outpaced the average market revenue growth year-to-date, good expense discipline being
maintained despite the complex separation process and the environment. So I'm pleased with where we are
and I hope that gives you a bit of a flavor of what the path ahead looks like.",337,11,32,0.6,financial_results
Citigroup,Third,MARK MASON,OTHER,"Yeah. In terms of the second part of your question, a couple things. So, one, we've been
seeing good growth in our Mexico Consumer business. We've also been investing in it appropriately so to
make sure that we protect the strength of that franchise as we prepare it for separation, ultimately for the
IPO.
Erika, if I understood your question right, if we turn to page 16 of the deck in the bottom right hand side, we
show the P&L for Mexico Consumer for 2022 and 2023. And so you can see the contribution from a revenue
and expense point of view so about $1.5 billion in 2023. And I think it's about $4 billion or so of TCE that we
have associated with this business. So that gives you some sense for the contribution, but it continues to
perform quite well as we manage it through this process.",149,11,33,0.6,financial_results
Citigroup,Third,ERIKA NAJARIAN,OTHER,"Perfect. Thank you. And as a follow-up question, I'm sure it is frustrating for you to see
the stock reaction in a quarter where you had PPNR strength and better expectations for net interest income
in the fourth quarter. So maybe I'll frame the question this way for you, Mark.
As we think about the gyrations in interest rate expectations globally, may be remind us sort of is it fair to
Copyright © 2024 Citigroup Inc. 11",77,11,34,0.6,opening_remarks
Citigroup,Third,MARK MASON,OTHER,"Okay. There's a lot there. But thank you. Thank you for the question. I would like to see the
stock reacting much more favorably because this really has been a strong quarter for us and in fact as you
mentioned, NII when you look through it, we've in fact taken our NII guidance up just a tad bit as we
referenced that the full year would be slightly down versus modestly down with the fourth quarter that's flat
to the third quarter and so that is an important takeaway.
I mentioned the headwinds and tailwinds earlier and we shouldn't lose sight of those. We will get lift from
reinvesting the securities as those mature, we will continue to see volume growth and those are important
drivers of tailwind activity for us.
You rightfully mentioned our interest rate exposure analysis that we do on a quarterly basis that reflects the
asset sensitivity of our business. And last quarter it was about $1.6 billion or so of a negative, assuming 100
basis point decline across the curve, assuming a static balance sheet and cross-currencies. And as you look
at that asset sensitivity, again, you rightfully pointed out that we skew non-US in terms of the magnitude of
that decline in NII should we see that parallel shift.
And in fact, it's as much as $1.3 billion or so of that $1.6 billion is non-US dollar related across 60 currencies.
And so you'd have to see all of that move in tandem for that drag and the US dollar drag is about $300 million
assuming 100 basis point shift and that's been coming down. If you look back over the quarters, we've been
thoughtfully managing that down and that's down to about $300 million number. I would expect when we
print the third quarter Q, it will be down a bit more. And so, again, we are asset sensitive but it does skew
outside of the US and thank you for asking the question because I think it's important to remind our investors
and analysts of that dynamic which in many ways may be different from that of other Institutions.
In terms of the late fees, we did say that we were including late fees in our assumptions, in our outlook that
we've given. I'll state the obvious Erika, which is that we want people to obviously pay on time and we do
everything that we can to assist and ensure that they do that. With that said, we don't have a definitive
timeline on late fees, nor are we overly reliant on late fees to drive revenue for our firm. And so it looks like
that decisioning will likely kind of fall closer to sometime in 2025 and so there is a small adjustment in the
last quarter of our revenue forecast but it's inside of the guidance that we gave and doesn't materially change
that in any way.
And then the last part of your question, I think, was around NIR and the fee revenue. And as I mentioned
earlier, I'm not going to give guidance for 2025 but I think your question was around where are we likely to
see continued momentum as it relates to fee revenue growth. And I would start with Services where fees
were up some 33% year-over-year and yes we should adjust for the Argentine Peso devaluation. But even if
you adjust for that it's double-digit, 11% year-over-year non-interest revenue growth. And when you look at
those drivers they've been consistently strong. Cross-border transaction value up 8%, US dollar clearing
volume up 7%, commercial card spend up 8%. In the supplement you'll see that it's mid to high single digit
year-to-date growth across those KPIs as well. We expect that that will continue with our corporate clients
and as we bring on new commercial clients as well.
I'll turn you to – if you look at Banking, we talked about already so I won't kind of lean into that too much but
except to highlight a really strong quarter in Banking, in Investment Banking fees, in particular, the rebound
that we've been talking about but importantly us capturing share in that rebound and these important
partnerships that position us well as sponsors start to lean back into the market the investments that we've
been making in talent, in sectors we need to strengthen. All of those things are going to play to continued fee
momentum as we go into 2025.

ahead.",18,13,36,0.6,qa_session
Citigroup,Third,GERARD CASSIDY,OTHER,"Mark, you touched on in your prepared comments about growing the US Personal
Banking RoTCE to higher levels. And you mentioned two items. One, innovative products and the
normalization of credit costs. Can you elaborate on those two items that will be contributing to the driver
aside from the efficiency improvement that you also touched on?",56,13,37,0.6,general_discussion
Citigroup,Third,MARK MASON,OTHER,"Yeah, sure. So obviously USPB is a combination of the cards businesses that we have in the
Retail Banking business and that cards portfolio has both Branded as well as Retail Services as part of it. And
even within Branded, we have proprietary cards where we frankly have been looking to how we can come up
with new innovative products. One example of product innovation is the recent refresh that we did of our
Strata Premier Card which was designed to drive acquisition and engagement with a new rewards offering.
And with that acquisitions are up some 7% both quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year for Branded Cards
so that's an example of product innovation.
Another one is we also launched FlexPay at Costco a few quarters ago and you can see good instalment loan
growth as a consequence of that, up some 15% or so. And so that type of product creation is important to
acquisitions, it's important to ensuring the card stays top of wallet and important to driving some of that top
line performance. And then the other thing that I mentioned, you're right was around cost of credit and that
really is the continued normalization of cost of credit. I mentioned a couple of times now the idea that
multiple vintages are maturing at the same time. And that has to play through for us to kind of see a more
normal level of credit and that will be important to the returns. And again, we are starting to see stabilization
in both the cost of credit line but also in delinquencies and that's a good indicator for us.",270,13,38,0.6,general_discussion
Citigroup,Third,GERARD CASSIDY,OTHER,"Very good. And then just following up on credit. In the Banking division, you guys
mentioned the cost of credit was, I think, $177 million due to ACL build of $141 million. And it was due to a
change in the mix in the portfolio. Can you share with us what that mix change was that drove this provision?",59,13,39,0.6,general_discussion

is a tailwind as rates decline. Can you just unpack how that happens? Is there any benefit from swap roll-off
or a floating swap that we should be thinking about that's embedded in that statement?",52,15,61,0.6,opening_remarks
Citigroup,Third,MARK MASON,OTHER,"There are a couple of things kind of to keep in mind on the Services business. So, one is, is
obviously this is a client business. It's not just a deposit taking business and so how we think about pricing
to those client becomes really important. You've got the US and non-US dynamic that's playing through. For
institutional clients, we've largely been holding to the higher betas that we saw as rates have ticked up.
Again, with the relationship in mind. And we have some offsetting pressure outside of the US as those betas
kind of catch up. But I think importantly you also heard me mention the reinvestment into securities at higher
yields and that reinvestment or those higher yields ultimately play out through the businesses and so that
will show up as part of kind of NII as we think about Services but the other businesses as well. And so those
are important components of the NII story for Services.
I think when you look at the in-quarter performance and [TTS] NII is down 5%, a big part of that is driven by
the Argentina rates movement in the quarter versus last year, so lower rates we're earning in Argentina
playing through that line particularly in this quarter. If you adjusted for that on the NII line, it would be flat to
slightly a little bit better. So that's really what it is. It's kind of management of client relationships as well as
the higher earnings on reinvested securities contributing to that as well as volume from operating account
growth that we expect.",265,15,62,0.6,financial_results

seven times earnings. If market conditions don't improve and Mexican asset prices remain depressed and

It's accretive to our returns. It's not a drag here in any shape or form so there is no need to rush for a
suboptimal result here. But we will IPO and we will exit Banamex, but we won't do that in a reckless manner.

commentary on that as we get into the fourth quarter earnings in January. What I will say again, as you think
about these businesses, we do see continued top line – we do expect continued top line momentum. We've
had eight consecutive quarters of positive operating leverage in USPB, 49% [efficiency ratio] this quarter. So
we're managing the expense base well. We think there's more upside to the top line. We're very focused on
growth across the portfolios and I do think that cost of credit again, if for no other reason but the
compounding effect of those vintages maturing as well as kind of inflation starting to come off, rates trickling
down, that should be better for the consumer and should start to play out in both the macroeconomic
scenarios that we run for CECL purposes but also ultimately in delinquencies and NCLs and we're starting to
see that improvement in delinquencies and its stabilization already somewhat. So I don't want to get into

Citigroup,Third,OPERATOR,MODERATOR,"Our next question will come from the line of Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.
Please go ahead.",22,16,68,0.6,qa_session
Citigroup,Third,MIKE MAYO,OTHER,"Hi. Thanks for the clarification on the asset cap question that I asked earlier. And I know you
are limited in how much you can say about regulators but just be clear, because a lot of e-mail traffic going
back, you did say there is no asset cap and you don't expect one and you don't expect other additional
actions at this time?",63,16,69,0.6,opening_remarks
Citigroup,Third,MIKE MAYO,OTHER,"Okay. Thank you for clarifying that. And I guess, look, I have great respect, I'm an ex-regulator,
Paul Volcker was my hero. I respect regulators. And nobody wants to see you cut corners to get to your $51
billion to $53 billion of expenses. But I'm just wondering – and you have consolidated systems apps, layers,
bureaucracy and you're divesting lots of activities. So it's just even the amended consent order was surprising
because you have taken so many efforts and if you should have had an amended consent order or other
actions, they probably should have been in place one, five, 10 or literally 20 years ago. And so that's just
confusing on the outside. So with that said, is this a matter of spending more money or about doing these
tasks more intelligently? In other words, you put more gas in the tank, the car's not going faster. So is it
amount of resources or just being more intelligent in terms of resolving some of these regulatory issues?",170,16,70,0.6,opening_remarks
Citigroup,Third,JANE FRASER,OTHER,"So let me break it down to a couple of pieces. So I start off just remind everyone the consent
orders are very, very broad and the action that was taken was because we're behind in a narrower area which
is the data particularly regarding our regulatory reporting where we're behind is the main area of focus. We
moved swiftly to address it.
We're very transparent about it from early on in the year that we were falling behind on this and overall I'm
pleased with our progress. And as you say, Mike, I listed a number of areas of progress and trying to make it
as tangible as we can, given what we can and can't say as this is supervisory. I'm pleased that our businesses
continue to improve their performance while the transformation is going on. They're the two priorities we
have this year so I think effectively, yes, we can walk and chew gum at the same time and the huge benefit of
all of the simplification on the business, on the organization, the other efforts, is making it easier for us to
execute and be very focused.
And well maybe, Mark, I’ll pass it over to you.",201,16,71,0.6,general_discussion
Citigroup,Third,MARK MASON,OTHER,"I think your question's helpful in the sense that you said is it kind of a rethink on our approach
or is it the need to spend more money and one of the things that we've done, Mike, is take a step back and
look at how we've been approaching data, for example. So this is – and we are going to make – we have made
some changes to our approach and those changes relate to how we get after resolving data issues that are
identified ensuring that there's engagement from the front end business, from the functions that are most
relevant and that there's consideration for what's required on reg reporting in order for us to get that process
streamlined and correct.

Citigroup,Third,JANE FRASER,OTHER,"And all of this drives productivity and other benefits for our shareholders as well as making
sure that we're strengthening Citi from the regulatory perspective.",25,17,73,0.6,general_discussion
Citigroup,Third,MIKE MAYO,OTHER,"And then last follow-up. To the extent that you see a disconnect between your performance
and the stock price that would seem to create more of an opportunity to buy the stock at $64 when tangible
book value is $90. And so, I hope that – I've used this analogy before, but hopefully you're selling the chairs
and the desk and the silverware in the executive dining room to go ahead and buy back stock whenever you
can.",78,17,74,0.6,general_discussion
Citigroup,Third,JANE FRASER,OTHER,"It's clearly given where we are trading, we're very focused around the opportunities to buy
back stock and mindful of the importance of it and equally, yes, we are proud of the performance of the
franchise this quarter. It was a very strong quarter and important set of proof points for our investors. We are
on a deliberate path. We're making the progress that we need to and actually pretty excited about the path
ahead of us and the potential that we see.",83,17,75,0.6,general_discussion
