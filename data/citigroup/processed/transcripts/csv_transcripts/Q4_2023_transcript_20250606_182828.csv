2023 Earnings Call. I am joined today by our Chief Executive Office, Jane Fraser, and our Chief Financial
Officer, Mark Mason. I'd like to remind you that today's presentation, which is available for download on
our website, citigroup.com, may contain forward-looking statements, which are based on management's
current expectations and are subject to uncertainty and changes in circumstances. Actual results may
differ materially from these statements due to a variety of factors, including those described in our earnings
materials as well as in our SEC filings.

Citigroup,Fourth Quarter 2023,JANE FRASER,OTHER,"Thank you, Jenn, and a very happy New Year to everyone. I hope you all had a good break.
At Citi, we are back at it. Given the notable items, and our new financial reporting structure, we have a lot
to cover today so I right to it.
2023 was a foundational year in which we made substantial progress simplifying Citi and executing the
strategy we laid out at Investor Day. With that said the fourth quarter was clearly very disappointing. Today
I will provide a high-level view on our progress in 2023, discuss our Q4 results, and finish with our priorities
for 2024. We know 2024 is critical as we prepare to enter the next phase of our journey and we are
completely focused on delivering our medium-term targets and our transformation.
So, turning to what we accomplished in terms of executing our strategy. As you can see on slide 5, in 2023,
we saw a record year for Services, where we maintained our #1 ranking among large institutions in TTS with
client wins up 27% and a sustained win/loss rate above 80%. We have now gained over 100bps in share in
Securities Services since 2021. In Wealth, we added an estimated $21 billion in net new assets during the
year. In USPB we enjoyed our sixth consecutive quarter of growth, and we began to see the early fruits of
our investments in key talent in Banking.
In September, we began the most consequential series of changes to the organization and the running of
our firm since the aftermath of the financial crisis. We restructured around five core, interconnected
businesses to align our organization to our business strategy and to provide greater transparency into their
performance. You now can see in our financials the full-year returns and P&L by business. While they are
all impacted by investments and Transformation expense, it is clear where we have work to do. The
simplification of our organization structure will conclude at the end of Q1 and will result in over $1 billion of
run-rate saves from the net elimination of approximately five thousand roles, mainly managers. As Mark

will detail, this will contribute to the reduction of our expens
simplification, benefits of the Transformation, stranded costs and other productivity efforts, we expect to
eliminate 20 thousand positions ex-Mexico, resulting in over $2 billion in run-rate saves.
Simplification is also enabling Citi to be more client focused and less bureaucratic. Realizing the synergies
between our five businesses is one of the key drivers to achieving our medium-term revenue targets. With
this new structure, I am holding my business leaders accountable for enhancing connectivity across clients
and products. In addition, having a Chief Client Officer acts to ensure we are disciplined in bringing the full
power of our franchise to our clients.
We have now completed the divestitures of 9 of our 14 international consumer franchises and have wound
down nearly 70% of our total retail loans and deposits in Russia, Korea and China. We have restarted the
sales process in Poland and are well down the execution path for the Mexico IPO next year. We are exiting
marginal businesses such as Munis and a subset of distressed debt trading to focus on our core strengths
and allocate our capital with rigor.
Without doubt, all these changes are difficult, but they are necessary. At the same time, we continued to
invest in our Transformation, risk and control environment and data architecture. We were pleased to have
closed the FX consent order with the Federal Reserve. We are committed to fulfilling the expectations of
our regulators given the unique role we play in the global financial system. The modernization of our tech
infrastructure is proceeding at pace allowing us to deliver new capabilities to our clients. During the year,
we consolidated trading and reporting platforms, and retired 6% of our legacy applications for the second
year in a row. These enhancements dovetail with significant investments in our businesses, such as hiring
commercial bankers to capture share, improving the digital payment capabilities we offer throughout our
global network, and automating processes for our Securities Services clients. It was also a year where we
upgraded talent with key internal promotions supplemented by selective external hires, including Andy
Sieg. The simplified reporting structure has been embraced by colleagues who feel empowered by the new
structure to serve clients and drive value for shareholders.
Earlier this week we disclosed additional external headwinds some of
which materialized in the second half of December including a $1.3 billion reserve build related to transfer
risk stemming from exposures to Argentina and Russia.
We also saw a nearly $900 million negative revenue impact as a result of the larger than expected
devaluation of the Argentine currency. These items, together with the $1.7 billion FDIC assessment, drove
this quarter to a negative EPS of $1.16. While these items are clearly very painful, they are quite
In terms of the performance of our five
businesses, while Services was the most impacted by the Argentine devaluation, the underlying growth
remains very strong, driven by share gains and client wins. Overall, Services revenues were up 16% for the
full year despite the impact of the Argentine devaluation. In TTS, cross-border transactions were up 15%
and AUC/AUA in Securities Services were up by close to $3 trillion for the year. In Markets, our Fixed Income
results were disappointing as we saw a significant slowdown in December particularly in Rates and FX.
Markets was also impacted by the Argentine devaluation. This franchise is well-positioned with our
corporate clients and we continue to take actions to improve returns, whether by redeploying capital to
high-return
We had a decent quarter in Equities, particularly in derivatives, and saw growth in prime balances, an area
we have been focusing on. While activity picked up in the fourth quarter with revenues up 22%, overall

going to start with the fourth quarter and full-year firmwide financial results, focusing on year-over-year
our medium-term return target. The presentation of our results reflects the changes we have made in
conjunction with our organizational simplification including reporting Legacy Franchises and
Corporate/Other in All Other. However, before I go into the results, let me walk you through some of the

Citigroup,Fourth Quarter 2023,Unknown Speaker,Unknown,"T R A N S C R I P T

notable items that impacted the quarter that were included in the 8K we recently filed.
At the top right of slide 7, we show these items on a pre-tax basis. The FDIC special assessment of
approximately $1.7 billion related to the regional bank failures in March. This impacted expenses in All
Other. A restructuring charge of approximately $780 million related to actions associated with our
organizational simplification, which will drive headcount reductions and future savings over the medium-
term, impacted expenses in All Other. The impact of the currency devaluation in Argentina of approximately
$880 million. This was recorded in non-interest revenue across Services, Markets and Banking and you can
see the impact by business in the appendix of the presentation.
While we did have an adverse impact from the Argentina devaluation this quarter, we also benefitted from
high interest rates, earning approximately $250 million of NII on the net investment in the quarter, given
the hyperinflationary environment. And a reserve build of $1.3 billion related to increases in transfer risk
associated with exposures to Russia and Argentina as described in the 8K. This impact is mostly included
in other provisions in cost of credit and spans multiple businesses due to their globality. The combination
of these items negatively impacted diluted EPS by approximately $2.00 and RoTCE by approximately 920
basis points.
Now turning to the left side of the slide, where we show our financial results for the full firm. In the fourth
quarter, we reported a net loss of $1.8 billion and a net loss per share of $1.16 on $17.4 billion of revenues.
Excluding the notable items, diluted EPS would have been $0.84 with an RoTCE of 4.1% for the quarter. In
the quarter, total revenues decreased by 3% on a reported basis. Excluding divestiture-related impacts and
the impact of the Argentina devaluation, revenues increased 2%, driven by strength across Services, USPB,
and Investment Banking, partially offset by lower revenues in Markets and Wealth and the revenue
reduction from the closed exits and wind-downs.
Turning to expenses, we reported expenses of $16.0 billion, which include the FDIC special assessment and
modest divestiture-related costs. Excluding these items, expenses increased 10% to $14.2 billion, largely
driven by the restructuring charge I just mentioned. Cost of credit was approximately $3.5 billion. Excluding
the reserve build for transfer risk, cost of credit was primarily driven by Card net credit losses, which are
now at pre-covid levels, as well as ACL builds for new card volumes. At the end of the quarter, we had nearly
$22 billion in total reserves with a reserve-to-funded loans ratio of approximately 2.7%. And on a full-year
basis, we delivered $9.2 billion of net income and an RoTCE of 4.9%. Adjusting for the notable items, net
income was approximately $13.1 billion with an RoTCE of 7.3%.
On slide 8, we show full year revenue trends by business from 2021 to 2023. It is important to highlight that
in conjunction with the change to align with our new financial reporting structure, we moved the majority
of the Financing & Securitization business from Banking to Markets. We also implemented a revenue
sharing arrangement within Banking, and between Banking, Services and Markets to reflect the benefit the
businesses get from our relationship-based lending. These changes are now reflected in our results and our
historical financials.
Now looking at the full year numbers. Services had a record year with revenues of $18.1 billion, up 16%,
benefiting from both rates and business actions, new client wins and deepening with existing clients,
partially offset by the Argentina devaluation. Markets revenues decreased 6% to $18.9 billion, largely driven
by lower volatility and a significant slowdown in December. The Markets business was also impacted by
the Argentina devaluation.
Banking revenues decreased 15% to $4.6 billion, primarily driven by the mark-to-market on loan hedges,
as well as a decrease in corporate lending. Investment Banking revenues were relatively flat for the year as
we gained share amidst a declining wallet. Corporate Lending revenues were down 4%, excluding mark-to-
market on loan hedges. Wealth revenues decreased 5% to $7.1 billion, primarily due to the deposit mix shift

towards higher yielding products which drove lower deposit spreads.
USPB revenues increased 14% to $19.2 billion, primarily driven by growth in cards balances as we continue
to see the benefit of our investments in digital acquisitions and customer engagement. Total revenues
excluding divestitures came in at $77.1 billion, below our guidance of $78-79 billion for the year largely due
to the impact of the Argentina devaluation, softer Markets performance, particularly in December and
losses on loan hedges. However, NII ex-Markets came in at $47.6 billion, in line with our guidance. Despite
the challenging environment and the impact of the Argentina devaluation, we grew firmwide revenues by
an approximately 4% ex-divestitures, in line with our investor day target, demonstrating the benefit of our
On slide 9, we show full year expense trends from 2021 to 2023. Excluding the FDIC special assessment
and divestiture-related impacts, full-year expenses were $54.3 billion for 2023, in line with our guidance.
As I mentioned, this includes roughly $780 million of restructuring costs associated with our organizational
simplification and additional severance costs of approximately $730 million, which included actions to
address stranded costs and start to right size the businesses.
Relative to the prior year, expense growth continued to be driven by Transformation and business-led
investments, volume-related expenses and other investments in risk and controls and technology, partially
offset by productivity savings and a reduction in expenses in Legacy Franchises, within All Other. Over the
performance
of the firm but also the businesses.
On slide 10, we show the components of our transformation and technology spend from 2021 to 2023. Over
the past three years, we have invested significantly in our infrastructure, platforms, applications, processes
and data. And as you can see in the bar chart, at the top of the slide, roughly 30% of our Transformation
investments over the last three years were in technology, with the remainder related to non-tech employees
and consultants.
e seen a shift from consulting expenses to technology and compensation as we have gotten
deeper into the execution of our Transformation And you should expect to see this trend continue In total,
we invested over $12 billion in technology in 2023. Beyond transformation, our technology investments are
also focused on digital innovation, new product development, client experience enhancements and areas
that support our infrastructure like cloud and cyber.
On slide 11, we show key consumer and corporate credit metrics. Across Branded Cards and Retail Services
approximately 80% of our card loans are to consumers with FICO scores of 680 or higher. And across both
portfolios, NCL rates have reached pre-covid levels but we continue to be well reserved with a reserve to
funded loan ratio of 7.7%. In our Corporate portfolio, the majority of our exposure is investment grade which
is reflected in our low level of non-accrual loans, at 63 basis points of total corporate loans. We feel good
about the quality and mix of our portfolio and are well reserved for the current environment.
network and the broader institutional client relationships we hold, as well as the strength of our financial
profile in Argentina. As it relates to Russia, we have also included a slide in the appendix. You will see that
the reserves for transfer risk that we have taken have significantly reduced our net investment and therefore
our risk of loss related to Russia.
On slide 12, we show our summary balance sheet and key capital and liquidity metrics. We maintain a very
strong $2.4 trillion balance sheet which is funded in part by a well-diversified $1.3 trillion deposit base
which is deployed into high-quality, diversified assets. The majority of our deposits, $801 billion, are
institutional and operational in nature and span across 90 countries and are complemented by $426 billion

of U.S. Personal Banking and Wealth deposits. We have approximately $561 billion of HQLA and
approximately $690 billion of loans and we maintain total liquidity resources of $965 billion. Our LCR
decreased modestly to 116%. And our tangible book value per share was $86.19, up 6%.
On the bottom left corner of the slide, we show a full year CET1 walk to provide more detail on the drivers in
2023. First, we generated $8.0 billion of net income to common, which added 70 basis points. Second, we
returned $6.1 billion in the form of common dividends and share repurchases, which drove a reduction of
about 53 basis points. Third, we benefitted from the impact of lower rates on our AFS investment portfolio,
which drove an increase of 20 basis points. And finally, the remaining 3 basis points was largely driven by
higher RWA, partially offset by capital releases from the exit markets. We ended the quarter with a 13.3%
CET1 capital ratio, approximately 100 basis points above our regulatory capital requirement of 12.3%. As
you can see, we have grown our CET1 ratio by approximately 30 basis points over the course of the year
while returning over $6 billion to shareholders in common dividends and repurchases.
Before I take you through each business, as Jane mentioned, we are not satisfied with the performance and
returns of our businesses and therefore we are laser focused on executing against our strategy, simplifying
the organization and right sizing the expense base. As a reminder the investments that we have been
making have impacted each of the businesses as you will see in the next few slides.
So now turning to slide 13, where we show the results for Services for the fourth quarter and the full year.
Revenues were up 6% this quarter, largely driven by NII across TTS and Securities Services, partially offset
by NIR driven by the Argentina devaluation. Services non-interest revenues were up 20% excluding the
impact of the Argentina devaluation. Expenses increased 9%, primarily driven by continued investments in
technology, product innovation and client experience. Cost of credit was $646 million, driven by a reserve
build of approximately $652 million, primarily associated with transfer risk in Russia and Argentina. Net
income decreased to $776 million, as higher revenues were more than offset by higher cost of credit and
higher expenses. Average loans were up 6%, primarily driven by strong demand for working capital loans in
TTS, both in North America and internationally. Average deposits were down 3% as the impact of
quantitative tightening more than offset new client acquisitions and deepening with existing clients,
however sequentially, deposits were up 1%. Services delivered an RoTCE of 13.4% for the quarter. And for
the full year, Services delivered an RoTCE of 20% on $18.1 billion of revenues.
On slide 14, we show the results for Markets for the fourth quarter and the full year. Markets revenues were
down 19%, versus a strong quarter last year, driven by a decline in fixed income and the impact of the
devaluation, partially offset by an increase in equities. Fixed Income revenues decreased by 25%, largely
driven by rates and currencies on lower volatility and a significant slowdown in December as well as the
impact of devaluation. However, we saw good underlying momentum in equities, with revenues up 9%,
driven by gains across all products. And we continued to grow prime balances while making solid progress
on our revenue-to-RWA target. Expenses increased 8%, driven by investments in transformation and risk
and controls and volume related costs, partially offset by productivity savings. Cost of credit was $209
million, driven by a reserve build of approximately $179 million, primarily associated with the transfer risk
in Russia and Argentina. Markets reported a net loss of $134 million, as revenues were more than offset by
higher expenses and higher cost of credit. Average loans increased 4% to $115 billion, as we saw increased
client demand for credit driving growth in warehouse lending. Average trading assets increased 18% to
$391 billion, largely driven by treasuries and mortgage-backed securities, given the strong client activity in
fixed income for much of the year. While it was a challenging quarter, Markets performed relatively well for
the full year with revenue of $18.9 billion and an RoTCE of 7.4%, compared with very strong performance in
the prior year. And we are focused on improving returns over time through a combination of revenue growth,
expense discipline, and capital optimization.
On slide 15, we show the results for Banking for the fourth quarter and the full year. Banking revenues
increased 22%, driven by growth in investment banking fees and lower losses on loan hedges, partially

offset by lower Corporate Lending revenue. Investment banking revenues increased 27% YoY, driven by
DCM and Advisory due to improvements in market sentiment. In Advisory, we saw signs of strength across
Technology, Healthcare and Energy, and we feel good about the strength of our pipeline. Corporate Lending
revenues excluding mark-to-market on loan hedges decreased 26%, largely driven by lower revenue share
from Investment Banking, Services and Markets. Expenses increased 37%, primarily driven by the absence
of an operational loss reserve release in the prior year. Excluding the reserve release, expenses were roughly
flat. Cost of credit was $185 million, driven by a reserve build associated with the transfer risk in Russia and
Argentina. The NCL rate was 32 basis points of average loans and we ended the quarter with a reserve to
funded loan ratio of 1.6%. Banking reported a net loss of $322 million as higher expenses and cost of credit
more than offset higher revenues. RoTCE was negative 6.0% for the quarter. And for the full year, Banking
reported an RoTCE of negative 0.2% on $4.6 billion of revenues. So clearly, we have more work to do on
capitalize on the rebound in the market wallet. And that includes continuing to invest in key growth areas,
upgrading talent in traditional sectors, and continuing to right size the business.
On slide 16, we show the results for Wealth for the fourth quarter and the full year. Wealth revenues
decreased 3%, driven by lower deposit spreads, partially offset by lower mortgage funding cost and higher
-interest revenue, which was up 13% in the
fourth quarter, driven by higher investment assets, increased client activity and market performance.
Expenses were up 4%, primarily driven by investments in risk and controls and technology, partially offset
by re-pacing strategic investments and tighter expense control as we begin to right size the expense base
in the business. Wealth reported net income of $5 million, as revenues were mostly offset by higher
expenses. Client balances increased 6%, primarily driven by higher client investment assets, partially offset
by lower deposit balances. Average loans were flat, as we continued to optimize capital usage. Average
deposits decreased 2%, reflecting the continued mix shift of deposits to higher-yielding investments on
Client investment assets were up 12%, driven by new acquisitions and the benefit from
higher market valuations. good momentum in net new assets, which more than doubled
to $16 billion for the quarter. For the full year, we added an estimated $21 billion in net new assets. RoTCE

strategy to drive investment revenue with an eye toward right sizing the expense base. We will wind down
non-core initiatives, exit less productive performers and enhance discipline across every expense line.
On slide 17, we show the results for US Personal Banking for the fourth quarter and the full year. US Personal
Banking revenues increased 12%. Branded Cards revenues increased 10%, driven by higher net interest
margin and interest-earning balance growth of 13%. And we continue to see healthy growth in new account
acquisitions, up 8% and spend volumes up 3%. Retail Services revenues increased 15%, also driven by
higher net interest margin and interest-earning balance growth of 11%, as well as lower partner payments
due to higher net credit losses. Retail Banking revenues increased 15%, driven by higher deposit spreads,
loan growth and improved mortgage margins. Expenses decreased 1%, as higher expenses to support
lending programs and client engagement, as well as the rollout of Simplified Banking were offset by lower
non-volume related expenses. Cost of credit of $2.1 billion increased 20%, driven by higher NCLs, partially
offset by a lower ACL build. Net income increased to $201 million, driven by higher revenues, partially offset
by higher cost of credit. Average deposits decreased 5%, driven by the transfer of relationships and the
associated deposits to our Wealth business. We continued to make progress against our digital strategy,
with digital deposits up 14% and active digital users increasing 6%. RoTCE for the quarter was 3.6%. And
for the full year, US Personal Banking delivered an ROTCE of 8.3% on $19.2 billion of revenue. Here again,
we are focused on improving the return profile of the business, managing through this part of the credit
cycle and continuing to make progress in Retail Banking will be key.
On slide 18, we show results for All Other on a managed basis, which includes Corporate Other and Legacy
Franchises and excludes divestiture-related items. Revenues decreased 17%, driven by a decrease in NII of

29%, largely driven by the closed exits and wind-downs, partially offset by higher non-interest revenue.
And expenses increased to $4.5 billion, driven by the FDIC special assessment and restructuring costs,
partially offset by lower expenses in both wind-down and exit markets.
Turning to slide 20, as we kick off 2024, the environment remains somewhat uncertain and Markets
remains difficult to predict, but based on what we see today we expect revenues to be approximately $80
to $81 billion as shown on the left side of the slide. And on the right side of the slide, we list the key drivers.
In TTS, we expect revenue growth to be driven by new client wins, deepening with our existing clients and
continued momentum with Commercial Clients as we continue to leverage our global footprint and product
innovations. In Securities Services, we have a very healthy pipeline and will continue to onboard assets
under custody from new mandates, win new clients and deepen relationships with existing clients. In
Investment Banking we anticipate a rebound in activity and to maintain our position as the wallet recovers.
technology, to allow us to gain share. And we also expect a modest rebound in Wealth, as we execute on
our refocused strategy with an eye towards growing investment fees, particularly with our existing clients.
In USPB, we expect continued growth in cards balances driven by the investments we have been making as
well as lower partner payments in retail services to continue to drive revenue growth. We also expect to
continue to improve our retail branch performance. And as it relates to NII, excluding Markets, we expect
net interest income to be down modestly as the volume growth we expect from loans and deposits is more
than offset by lower US rates and the reduction from the closed exits and wind-downs.
Turning to slide 21, we expect expenses to be approximately $53.5 to $53.8 billion, down from $54.3
billion, subject to volume-related expenses. The decrease in expenses will be driven by the benefits of our
organizational simplification, a continued reduction from exit markets and wind-downs, and productivity
savings, partially offset by investments in risk and controls and volume-related expenses. Embedded in
this guidance includes an elevated level of severance, as well as additional potential costs related to the
organizational simplification totaling approximately $700 million to $1 billion. This will contribute to
reducing headcount over 2024 and the medium term, which we will discuss on the next slide.
On slide 22, we show the drivers of headcount and expense reduction over the medium-term.
discussed in the past, there are three drivers that will reduce our expenses. Organizational simplification
including the reduction of management layers. Eliminating stranded costs as we take additional actions to
reduce excess overhead in light of the exit markets. And realizing productivity savings from our investments
in the transformation and technology. We expect the combination of these three drivers to reduce our
headcount by a net 20 thousand, excluding Mexico, and generate a net run rate save of $2 to $2.5 billion
over the medium term. This will underpin our path to $51 to $53 billion of expenses, subject to volume-
related expenses. Both the headcount and expense reduction will allow us to right size the firm and
businesses to improve performance and returns.
On slide 23, we show our outlook for U.S. Cards in 2024. In terms of credit performance, based on the
above pre-COVID levels and peak in 2024. On a full-year basis for 2024, we expect the Branded Cards NCL
rate to be in the range of 3.5% to 4.0% and the Retail Services NCL rate to be in the range of 5.75% to 6.25%.
From an allowance perspective, we are reserved for a weighted 8-quarter average unemployment rate of
almost 5.0%, which imbeds a downside scenario of approximately 6.8%. ACL builds in 2024 will primarily
be a function of the volume growth that we see as well as changes in the macro scenarios and the
probabilities associated with them. And we expect continued momentum in cards albeit more in line with
mid-single digit loan growth.
On slide 24, we summarize our medium-term targets. While a lot has changed in the macro environment
since Investor Day, our strategy has not, and we are on a path to the 11-12% RoTCE in the medium term,
driven by top line revenue growth and expense reductions. From a revenue perspective, we continue to

to get there, and over the last three years we've done so.
Page 4 is who we are today. We are five interconnected businesses; no more, no less. We have our
organization that now aligns with those five businesses, and this enables us to focus on two priorities. The
first is improving the performance and the returns of those five core businesses, so that we can meet the
medium-term RoTCE target we laid out. And the second is on addressing our regulatory issues through the
transformation. And I would also be, I need to note that I fully recognize that 2024 is an inflection year, Mike.
And I and the management team are accountable to deliver. And that you and our investors have the
transparency you need to hold us accountable.
So, why is this time different? Look, it's not lost on me that there's been many attempts in the past to change
this firm. I and the management are fully committed to transforming this company for the long term and we
are addressing the issues that have held us back in the past. And you've got proof points of the last three
years where we've made a lot of tough decisions and we have put through a tremendous amount of change
to get to the simple Citi that we are today. We completely reset our strategy. So, we now have a significantly
more focused business and operating model.
We've announced the most consequential set of changes to our organizational model, and frankly, from my
perspective, more importantly, how we run the bank, since the financial crisis, aimed at simplifying the bank
and increasing accountability. You've seen moved quickly. We're on track with our execution of this
effort. And it will generate over $1 billion of run rate saves the end of the first quarter, purely from the
organization efforts that we've put in that we announced in September. We've done this while investing and
I think this is another difference. We've invested heavily in our transformation. And while that was catalyzed

Citigroup,Fourth Quarter 2023,MARK MASON,OTHER,"Yeah, thanks, Jane. And why aren't expenses down more? I think to your point, Jane, we've
been investing in the franchise both on the front-end, and importantly, on the transformation and the risk
and controls. What I would point out is that, in 2023, we delivered expenses of $54.3 billion ex the FDIC
charge. That is the guidance that we gave. But I also highlight that we also included $780 million associated
with the restructuring charge. That is more than I had articulated in the way of guidance. So, the capacity
that we created through our efforts through the year, we use that in a smart way. We use that to fund the org
simplification cost, so that we can realize the savings down the line. And we're going to continue to manage
our expenses in a disciplined and smart fashion. That means spending what we need to spend on the
transformation and risk and controls, but driving greater efficiencies and productivities along the way to
ensure we get to that 11% to 12%. And to your point, if revenues are to come down or come in lower than
expected, we'll adjust the expenses accordingly.",195,10,14,0.6,opening_remarks

Citigroup,Fourth Quarter 2023,GLENN SCHORR,OTHER,"Hi. Thanks very much. So, you're clearly making a lot of progress and I hate to like, ask this
question too early, but I think it is important. Your expense guidance is good, your revenue guide is good, and
you have your arms around the expenses. The question I have is, how do you think about balancing that near-
term profitability improvement that we all want desperately with making sure you do make the right
investments? Because if you look around the world there's a lot of places to grow, whether it be a branch
network, or the wealth management aspirations that you have, or the digital investments. So, how do we
know that all the right future investments are being made while you extract costs in all the good ways that
you've been doing?",135,10,16,0.6,opening_remarks
Citigroup,Fourth Quarter 2023,MARK MASON,OTHER,"Yeah, thanks, Glenn. I guess, I'll start, and Jane, feel free to add in on it. Look, it is a balancing
act, right, and we do look at each of our five core businesses. We obviously are clear on the strategy, but
where's the growth? Where are the return opportunities associated with them? And how do we ensure we're
deploying resources after them in order to deliver for the client and deliver on those returns over time? We
have to juxtapose that against the required investment to modernize our operations and we're making those
trade-offs on a regular basis. But importantly, when we do invest to capture those growth opportunities,
we're trying to be agile about it, which means if those opportunities don't play out in the way we're expecting
because the cycle just doesn't mature or materialize in that fashion, we've got to be disciplined enough to

don't know if you've dimensionalized how much was rate versus new business, but you have good core
business momentum and a pipeline of won, but not yet funded. So I guess the question is, where can Services
be over, let's say, the next two years in terms of growth, while rates come down, yet your businesses is
winning new wins?",77,11,18,0.6,qa_session
Citigroup,Fourth Quarter 2023,MARK MASON,OTHER,"Yeah, sure. You want me to, sure.",7,11,19,0.6,general_discussion
Citigroup,Fourth Quarter 2023,JANE FRASER,OTHER,"Yeah and I'll jump in, too. Let's maybe start with TTS. When we think about the performance
of TTS, which, as we say, the growth this year up 19% ex-Argentina, came from a combination of both rates
and the strong business actions we've taken. And you can see that in the different drivers. Cross-border was
up 23%, commercial cards up 8%. In terms of the growth prospects, we've generated 22% in average revenue
growth, from 21 to 23, well ahead of the Investor Day guidance we had of high-single digits. That was not just
because of the rate cycle. It obviously helped. And we certainly expect to grow revenues at mid-single digit
now as we lap the prior periods that benefited from those rate increases, and that's going to come from a few
different areas.
One, the focus on our fee strategy, where we're capitalizing on strong client engagement, market-leading
client solutions, and we're delivering on a lot of the different growth initiatives that we've been investing in
across all our client segments. We'll continue optimizing our deposit book and bringing in high-quality
deposits. And in a lower rate environment, GDP is typically higher, so you'd expect to see some higher growth
in our capital-efficient payment volumes.
You'll see us continuing to acquire new clients and deepen relationships with existing clients. And I'd point
to our confidence here, 27% increase in our new client acquisition this year and a sustained win/loss ratio of
82% on new deals, and that was across different client segments. And revenues from these clients just
continues to ramp up, as we expand across the different geographies and product suites with them. And
you'll also continue to see us investing in the infrastructure and platforms we've been doing, launching new
innovative products. And we're seeing momentum from some of the things we've recently done: Citi Token
Services, Payment Express, 24/7 Clearing, et cetera. So I think, the main takeaway from TTS is that we'll
continue to invest in it. We expect to see strong client momentum. We've been getting consistently good
client feedback regarding our capabilities, so we expect to see good global growth that will certainly help as
the rate cycle comes down. And it is a crown jewel for a reason.
And then, just quickly on Securities Services. I think where we're seeing, we mentioned, we've got a number
of marquee wins there across all the client segments. That pipeline is both investors and issuers. And one of
the core strategies that Okan put in place was to grow share with the US-based asset managers. We were at
2.6% share in 2020; we're now at 4.3%. And a lot of the growth in the pipeline has been coming, not only
from our global network names, but also from the marquee players in the US asset manager space. I think
that's our ability to connect our capabilities that gives these players huge efficiencies for our clients.
Mark, anything I've missed there? You know I love this business.

Citigroup,Fourth Quarter 2023,MARK MASON,OTHER,"As you should rightfully so, high-returning business, great growth prospects. To answer one
of your questions, Glenn, about half of the NII growth, we could attribute to interest rates. And about half,
I'd say, is business action, so us working with the clients to drive that momentum. And then, if you think
about the noninterest revenue, for Services, they're up about 20% in the quarter year-over-year if you
exclude the impact of the Argentina devaluation, and up 7% on a full year basis. And so, good momentum in
the noninterest revenue growth as well.",94,12,21,0.6,financial_results

Citigroup,Fourth Quarter 2023,JOHN MCDONALD,OTHER,"Hi good morning. Mark, was hoping to ask you, how are you thinking about the pacing
of capital build? Obviously, the Basel III proposals are out there, but they could change, of course. Even if
they don't change, you have a couple of years to leg into those with the phase-ins and perhaps some
mitigation opportunities. How should we think about you kind of building capital, given all those variables
and the ability to buy back some stock along the way as you mentioned earlier?",85,12,23,0.6,opening_remarks
Citigroup,Fourth Quarter 2023,MARK MASON,OTHER,"Sure, so look, John, obviously the Basel III proposal's still out there and under discussion.
We've been very vocal about the potential impact of that. We've also been very disciplined about how we've
been managing our capital. We've built that over 30 basis points over the course of the year. You've seen us
actively manage that through the year, and we're going to continue to do that. We obviously generate
earnings that contribute to that. We want to continue to drive growth across the business.
We're trading at a 0.5 times book, where we can, we want to buy back as much as we can in shares. And we
try to be disciplined about that over the past couple of quarters, doing that as a modest level. You heard me
say, we're going to do that again this quarter at a modest level, but we have to be thoughtful about what
those headwinds might look like. And we're actively working what mitigation actions we have to put in place,
should it turn out closer to the way the current proposal sits.
So, it's an ongoing active management that tries to balance servicing our client needs, with, obviously,
holding a responsible amount of capital in light of the uncertainty that's out there, and with an eye towards
buybacks where we can do that.",222,12,24,0.6,financial_results
Citigroup,Fourth Quarter 2023,JOHN MCDONALD,OTHER,"Okay. And just as an expense follow-up, I wasn't clear. Has the transformation spend
peaked, when you think about what you'll spend on transformation this year versus last year? And are the
transformation benefits starting to kick in at this point?",41,12,25,0.6,general_discussion
Citigroup,Fourth Quarter 2023,MARK MASON,OTHER,"Yeah. So to be clear, we're going to continue to spend whatever we need to spend on the
transformation and on risk and controls. And so, we did see a tick up this year. We've got a plan for 2024, and
if we've got to spend a bit more than we spent this year, we're going to spend more. That's what the plan calls
for, and so that's what we'll do. That's inside of the number that I've given you for guidance, all right. And so,
that's important for us. I think it will drive, obviously, operational improvement and saves down the line.
It is part of the $2 billion to $2.5 billion, but that is the early stage, if you will, of the transformation spend
paying back. I think as we talked about at Investor Day, frankly, we'll continue to see expense benefits
beyond the medium term from some of this transformation investment that we've been making. And so, I
would think of the medium term as the start of the benefits that we'll see from the investments we've been
making in transformation and risk and controls.",188,12,26,0.6,guidance
Citigroup,Fourth Quarter 2023,JANE FRASER,OTHER,"Yeah. I think, Mark, you're spot on. So we'll continue making the investments we need to in
the transformation. It's a multi-year journey, as we've always been clear around this, ultimately, with
benefits to the shareholders. And more of the expense saves that we've been talking about are, I'd separate
out transformation from sort of the operating expense base of our businesses, which we want to make sure

Citigroup,Fourth Quarter 2023,JIM MITCHELL,OTHER,"Hey, good afternoon. Mark, maybe just to follow up on the expense, slide 22, where you talk
about $2 billion to $2.5 billion of expense saves. I guess I'm struggling with the numbers there. I think if you
look at exit and wind- down markets, you're probably close to $2 billion in numbers there. And maybe the
stranded costs, you can't get all of that out. You're doing about severance is $700 million to $1 billion in
2024. So doesn't seem like there's a ton of actual cost saves in that number. And just maybe I'm wrong, if you
could just kind of walk me through the numbers embedded in there and if there's, you've kind of eluded to
more to come beyond the intermediate term.",126,13,29,0.6,opening_remarks
Citigroup,Fourth Quarter 2023,MARK MASON,OTHER,"Yeah, I think the thing I'd point out to you is a couple things. One, obviously, we're forecasting
revenue growth over this period of time. And so, there's going to be volume-related expenses associated with
that. The second thing I'd point out, as I just mentioned to the prior question, is that we're continuing to
invest in risk and controls and in the transformation over this period of time.
And so, what you see is there's an increase in expenses associated with at least those two things. And that's
offset by the savings that we're starting to generate, particularly from the org simplification that Jane has
talked about, as well as from the stranded cost reduction that will continue to play out, as well as from some
of the rightsizing of businesses that we've referenced in some of the prepared remarks. And so, important to
think about, there are headwinds and tailwinds that kind of net down to this $2 billion to $2.5 billion.
And then the final point that I'd make is if I look at this medium-term number of $51 billion to $53 billion that
still has Mexico in it and one of the other pages we'd point to, expenses around Mexico. But because of where
we are, we'll be in the IPO process, that's still going to be part of this expense base, and so you can't lose sight
of that.",234,13,30,0.6,financial_results
Citigroup,Fourth Quarter 2023,JIM MITCHELL,OTHER,"Well, that's an important clarification that the $2 billion to $2.5 billion includes revenue-
related volume growth, so that's helpful. And then, just maybe the other, on the slides talking about revenue
targets. One of the big numbers not talked about was Markets. How are you thinking, volatility has come in,
macro pictures getting better, maybe that mutes volatility, how do you think about that business in 2024

Citigroup,Fourth Quarter 2023,EBRAHIM POONAWALA,OTHER,"Morning, afternoon, Jane. Just wanted to follow up on something I think Mark said
at the end of his very first response around, it's very hard in my seat to figure out whether you're going to grow
revenues or shrink revenues given the macro. Should we take it based on what you've said today as we look
into 2026 getting to that 11% RoTCE, if for whatever reason, revenue falls short and you feel good about the
expense flex to mitigate that headwind?",83,14,34,0.6,financial_results
Citigroup,Fourth Quarter 2023,JANE FRASER,OTHER,"It's Jane, obviously. I want to just jump in on one bit, which is we are committed and we're
very confident around the 4% to 5% revenue growth rate, so there isn't any backing away from that number.
And that's in various macro environments, et cetera. And as we look across the different businesses, and the
projections we have, we're confident around that. Obviously, if there's a very adverse macro environment, et
cetera, we've got other levers we can take, but Mark, let me pass it to you.",88,14,35,0.6,financial_results
Citigroup,Fourth Quarter 2023,MARK MASON,OTHER,"And by no means was I trying to suggest that we weren't confident in the forecast for the top
line. If you think about the strategy and the strength of those five core businesses, we've got a lot of
conviction around that. With that said, as you point out, Jane, under a circumstance where that doesn't play
out, there are obviously volume-related incentive comp expenses and the like that would naturally come
down. We'd ensure that they came down with the revenue decline or shortfall. And then we'd recalibrate
other spend, other investments, spend not related to risk and controls and transformation, but other
investments across the platform, we'd recalibrate accordingly.",111,14,36,0.6,financial_results
Citigroup,Fourth Quarter 2023,EBRAHIM POONAWALA,OTHER,"Well said. Just what I needed. And one quick question. As we think about
rightsizing the Markets business, there have been headlines around the muni and the distressed business
that you've gotten out. Is there a risk where the Markets business becomes too small and you lag the scale
to be sort of efficient and relevant in certain, or just across the breadth of, be it, fixed income or equities? Just
if you can talk about that. Thank you.",79,14,37,0.6,opening_remarks
Citigroup,Fourth Quarter 2023,JANE FRASER,OTHER,"The short answer is no. If you think about our Markets business, we have four businesses,
each of which are around sort of $4 billion or so in size. You have our global FX network, where we're typically
number one in any year, just given the strength, and particularly, the corporate client base we've set off.
Rates, typically top three. Together, these are two of the largest macro pools within FICC.
In terms of the spread products, we've been putting our financing and securitization business as part of our
simplification, fully within Markets, so that we've created a unified, scaled spreads product business. And
then finally, equities, where we're focused on improving our prime offering, building balances. We still have
a way to go obviously in that. Prime balances we're pleased they were nicely up this year, driven by client
momentum. And we're a leading equities derivative franchise. So, you do have these four core businesses.
And I'd go back to our big point of differentiation and why we feel we're well-positioned. We have a very
differentiated corporate client base and very strong partnerships between our core Markets franchise, TTS,
and Banking and Securities Services, and that helps us in FX, in commodities and in rates around the world.
So, Markets is important both in terms of its leadership, but also, how it fits into the strengths that we have
from this simpler Citi of those five core interconnected businesses.
We've demonstrated solid returns in the past. I think a lot of the actions we've been taking will help drive
returns in the future. And you should be getting confidence when you see the discipline we're putting on to

Some of your peers have come out with their guides using the forward curve in their net interest income
forecast which includes the Fed in our country, six cuts. Can you give us some color what kind of rate
environment, I know you said lower rates, but any insights around that guide?",90,15,40,0.6,opening_remarks

assuming three to six cuts, right. You've got a range there and the reason I described it like that is that, if you
think about our IRE, as we've shown it in the Qs before, we're positioned such that, with 100 basis point
move, parallel shift in rate across the curve, the US dollar impact would only be a couple hundred million
dollars, all right, and so, to the negative, obviously, but it's a couple hundred million dollars. And so as we
think about that forecast, and as I mentioned, NII being down a bit, that covers kind of three to six cuts over

when will you feel comfortable giving us a buyback outlook that's beyond just fourth quarter? I know you still
have a little bit of ways to go, but you do have 100 basis point buffer to your minimum. And I know Basel III
endgame is still out there, and I'm sure that reducing risk just doesn't mean expenses, but also reducing your
or being mindful of your RWA footprint. And given where your stock is relative to book, when will you be
more comfortable about giving sort of a longer-term outlook that was underpinning your RoTCE target with
regards to the buyback?",120,15,45,0.6,opening_remarks

taken a really good whack on the net investment. And you also highlighted how the CTA would be capital-
neutral, even if you did have to write that down. But what about the remaining exposure? And just like how
prime are you responsible for some of these unremittable corporate derivatives? I think a lot of us don't
understand that type of exposure. And is there risk to you going forward, or could you hopefully clear it back
from the outside exposure going forward?",118,16,48,0.6,qa_session
Citigroup,Fourth Quarter 2023,JANE FRASER,OTHER,"Yeah, actually, I also want to kind of take a bigger picture answer to that before I turn it to
Mark. Because I would have thought that's a question that is on everybody's minds, particularly given the
firm's overall low level of returns and our headline numbers this quarter about what we've been doing with
Russia and Argentina, the sort of bigger strategic question behind it, and then we'll get to your specifics on
the Russia front.
If you think about Citi, we have a differentiated global business model, and that means we're committed to
the countries in which our multinational clients operate over the long run. So, that means we hold long-term
capital in those countries, upon which we generate solid returns through the cycle. And let me just point to
our leading Services and FX businesses are the heart of that network, and they're generating double-digits,
as you can see.
With that footprint comes a set of risks. So, I think of it in terms of credit, currency, transferability of capital.
And we've proven our ability to manage those risks consistently over a long period of time. And with respect
to the Q4 currency and transfer items, while the timing was unknown and we've highlighted those risks in
our disclosures for a couple of years, I'd say, Russia is rather unique. It's a war, and for us, a highly unusual
liquidation. We've navigated it very well. We've executed our wind-down in an orderly way with very low
losses for our clients and very low losses for us. Our remaining net assets are now 100% reserved against.
And I think similarly, if I just touch on Argentina for a minute, because I'm sure, folks have got a few questions
on that. Similarly, over the last several years, we've de-risked our business model there. We don't have a
consumer bank, so we've really reduced down our emerging markets exposures to just our institutional
presence, focused on the multinational clients, you've heard us talk about that, and select high-grade local
clients.
If you look at Argentina, it's a very good business for us over the cycle. And even after the impacts of Q4, we
had less than $5 million in credit losses in Argentina over a 10-year period. That's remarkable, $5 million over
10 years. In terms of the currency risk, we all have to book revenues, the official rate versus the parallel market
rate. We are able to partially but not fully hedge the exposure, but we would certainly always take economic
decisions on the business we do and did mindful of likely devaluations and capital controls. And the reserve
Copyright © 2024 Citigroup Inc. 16",446,16,49,0.6,financial_results
Citigroup,Fourth Quarter 2023,MARK MASON,OTHER,"Yeah, very quickly on the Russia point. As you know and as the slide points out, we've
continued to bring our exposure down there. It's down to $6.5 billion, it's down 13% from the previous year
and a third from 2021. We've brought down the consumer loans, the consumer deposits in a significant way
there. And essentially, what's left is that we have a custody business and we're holding corporate dividends
that are our clients' proceeds were unable to pay those out by law, by regulation, and so we have to hold
those and so that's what's being referenced in the slide when we say unremittable Russia corporate
dividends. And so, that is not a risk of loss for us, but we're unable to kind of clear those because of the state
of play in Russia at this stage.
Okay, that was clear. And then, just separately in credit cards. You and a lot of your peers
expect losses to go up from here, but most of you are saying, they're going to peak at this year, including you.
Just what gives you confidence that the card losses will peak this year is it just getting back to that a little bit
of a normalized level? Is it some tightening that you've done? What's driving that confidence, looking out this
year? Because you're probably seeing a step-up coming still, right?",230,17,50,0.6,guidance
Citigroup,Fourth Quarter 2023,MARK MASON,OTHER,"Sure ,there's a step-up coming. We gave a forecast on 2024 (sic), as you point out, to what

see actually on the slide how there was a dip in loss rates during the COVID period. And so to some extent,
what we're seeing is kind of a catch up of those, as those portfolios go through a longer maturation than what
you'd normally see in a cards portfolio.
On top of that, we've been originating new card. You've noticed our acquisitions have grown, so we obviously
have new card loans, and those are going through a much normal maturation period. And so, as we look at
the early buckets and the delinquencies that are playing out, we've got a pretty good sense for when we
would expect those to peak and at what level. And we think they'll peak inside of 2024, so that's captured in
that average forecast that we've given.
We haven't made material changes to our underwriting. However, there is mix evolution that happens.
Transactors, we have a number of transactors that have kind of come on to our portfolio and are in the mix
of our Branded portfolio as well. So, anyway, those are the drivers that give us confidence and inform the
trajectory that we're talking about here.",234,17,51,0.6,guidance
Citigroup,Fourth Quarter 2023,OPERATOR,MODERATOR,Our next question will come from Ryan Kenny with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.,16,17,52,0.6,qa_session
Citigroup,Fourth Quarter 2023,RYAN KENNY,OTHER,"Hi. Thanks for taking my question. So, I have a question on quantitative tightening.
Wondering if you have any early thoughts on how Citi's positioned if the Fed ends QT early? Is that a material
catalyst for you, and would that help you hit your revenue targets even sooner?",49,17,53,0.6,opening_remarks
Citigroup,Fourth Quarter 2023,MARK MASON,OTHER,"Yeah. Again, I mean, when I think about our interest rate exposure, and for US dollar in
particular, we showed it in our last Q, we'll show it in this Q. For a 100 basis point move in a parallel shift,
we're looking at probably a negative $1.6 billion or so, but important to point out that the US dollar
component of that is only a couple hundred million dollars. Similarly, if rates moved in the other way, positive
of 100 basis points, there'd be a small movement as it relates to US dollar exposure. So our US dollar
exposure is relatively neutral, again, assuming a static balance sheet, a parallel shift in the curve. And so,
we're kind of neutral relative to rates moving in either direction and, therefore, the impact there.

Citigroup,Fourth Quarter 2023,RYAN KENNY,OTHER,"Then, there's a lot of optimism and debate around capital markets rebound. Are you seeing
that? And can you help update us on Investment Banking pipeline across M&A, ECM, DCM?",30,18,55,0.6,general_discussion
Citigroup,Fourth Quarter 2023,JANE FRASER,OTHER,"Yes. We certainly had a much more constructive market environment to the end of 2023.
Interest rate spreads and volatility at lows for the year. Equity prices are high. And I think we view this as a
helpful foundation for activity to accelerate in 2024, assuming the tailwinds persist. And speaking of our
own pipeline, the breadth, the depth, the quality of it's very sound. It's higher than it was pre-COVID. So
when markets are constructive, we expect to move these opportunities forward. And we're hearing a lot more
confidence from the CEOs, CFOs around this.
And yeah, we're looking at our own side. As you know, we've been investing in some higher-growth areas, so
we get a good balance between our traditionally strong sectors as well as high-growth areas. And we've been
seeing some very good momentum in healthcare and technology, as well as areas of traditional strength,
which is energy and industrial. And I think we feel very confident in the recovery in DCM. The beginnings of
one in LevFin. And so, cautiously optimistic here. So I wouldn't say that it's going to accelerate enormously
and with incredible speed, but I think we're feeling much better about the foundation. Mark, anything you'd
add?",205,18,56,0.6,guidance
Citigroup,Fourth Quarter 2023,OPERATOR,MODERATOR,Our next question comes from Scott Siefers with Piper Sandler. Your line is now open.,15,18,57,0.6,qa_session
Citigroup,Fourth Quarter 2023,SCOTT SIEFERS,OTHER,"Good afternoon, everybody. Thanks for taking the questions. Have you all assumed any
revenue attrition just related to the reduction in force? And I guess just broadly, how might that be embedded
in the 2024 revenue guidance? And I guess just at a top level, maybe just a shot or two on...",52,18,58,0.6,opening_remarks
Citigroup,Fourth Quarter 2023,JANE FRASER,OTHER,"Sorry, Scott, I didn't hear what it was. I think the phone line cut out. The revenue attrition?",18,18,59,0.6,financial_results
Citigroup,Fourth Quarter 2023,SCOTT SIEFERS,OTHER,"I'm sorry. Yeah, just curious if you have assumed any revenue attrition related to the
reduction in force over the coming year.",22,18,60,0.6,financial_results
Citigroup,Fourth Quarter 2023,JANE FRASER,OTHER,"Okay, no, no we haven't. I think a lot of the moves that we've made from the organization
simplification, so the 5,000 or so roles we talked about, they're mainly managerial roles. And they've mainly
impacted the functions and the geographies, not nearly so much the revenue from revenue generators.
And the other piece is with the client organization, we're actually putting much more time into the hands of
our people to drive revenue forward, so I think what we're looking at here is getting rid of areas of bureaucracy
and where we've been too complicated, where we can drive efficiency whilst preserving our frontline and
encouraging them to be as revenue-productive and delivering the full force of the firm to the client. So I like
to see the opposite actually.",131,18,61,0.6,financial_results
Citigroup,Fourth Quarter 2023,SCOTT SIEFERS,OTHER,"Okay, perfect, thank you. And then, Mark, can you discuss for a second maybe, just broadly,
the flow of expenses through the year? I know that they should begin to decline towards the end, but what
happens between now and then? Do they hold kind of flattish with a core rate, or would there be any normal
course of business growth?",61,18,62,0.6,opening_remarks
Citigroup,Fourth Quarter 2023,MARK MASON,OTHER,"I think what I'd say is that, you should expect it in the first quarter. We'd likely see an uptick
in our total expenses relative to the fourth, in part because, as Jane has mentioned, we anticipate that there'll
be more to the org simplification and, therefore, dollars associated with that in Q1. And then, from there, I
would expect that you see a downward trend through the fourth quarter.

Citigroup,Fourth Quarter 2023,OPERATOR,MODERATOR,Our next question will come from Vivek Juneja with JP Morgan. Your line is now open.,16,19,64,0.6,qa_session
Citigroup,Fourth Quarter 2023,VIVEK JUNEJA,OTHER,"Hi Jane, hi Mark. Couple of quick clarifications. On your NII guide, you talked about you're
assuming three to six cuts. That's US, I presume, so are you assuming flat, unchanged rates outside the US
since you have more sensitivity outside?",41,19,65,0.6,general_discussion
Citigroup,Fourth Quarter 2023,MARK MASON,OTHER,"Modest declines outside, but yes declines outside as well, but not nearly of the magnitude
of what we're talking about in the US.",23,19,66,0.6,general_discussion
Citigroup,Fourth Quarter 2023,VIVEK JUNEJA,OTHER,"Okay. And then, Jane, to your point about the 20,000 head count cuts and I heard you just
mentioned 5,000 from managerial positions, where are the rest 15,000 coming there?",30,19,67,0.6,general_discussion
Citigroup,Fourth Quarter 2023,JANE FRASER,OTHER,"So let me just be clear about where the ones that we've just done and that we're working on
through the organization simplification. So when I think about that effort, it will close at the end of the first
quarter, as we said. We're expecting to get about $1 billion of run rate save from the org simplification work
alone. That constitutes about 5,000 heads. We're just about to, at the end of this month, finish Phase 3,
which will mean the first four layers of the organization have been addressed. That's been a net reduction of
about 1,500 managers out of a total of 12,000 roles. There's about 13%, and these are mainly manager roles,
as I talked about earlier.
Then, when we think about where are other expense opportunities on top of this, as Mark was talking about
earlier, the stranded costs, we'll be completing the elimination of the stranded costs from the divestitures.
We'll be continuing, and you've seen us been continuing that, exiting marginal businesses and hobbies and
the like and being very disciplined about that.
We've got some businesses where we feel we need to right size the core expense base. Andy Sieg is going to
be kicking off that in Wealth, and you'll begin to see some of the impact of that in the first quarter. He's off to
a strong start. And then, we've got others where we'll be creating more utilities. We've still got different
fragmented activities across the firm that the organization simplification has highlighted. We'll be
aggregating those, creating utilities, or are consolidating some of those different functions. And that is
before we get to, beginning to get benefits from the transformation, where there'll be efficiencies that come
through.
We'll still have areas that we're investing. These are going to be, as we talked about, core business
investments. It's going to be expense growth still in the top, from volume growth that we've got. And we will
be investing in our transformation. And all of this is happening over the medium term to get us to the 11% to
12% RoTCE target we talked about.
So that 20,000, it's the number that we estimate of the headcount. I don't love thinking headcount. I like
thinking about expenses. I think it's a more meaningful number. So as Mark laid out in his presentation, we've
got a net expense save that we're expecting to achieve from the medium term. And these are the raft of
different areas that will be contributing to it, and we're working hard at it.",427,19,68,0.6,guidance

Citigroup,Fourth Quarter 2023,STEVEN CHUBAK,OTHER,"Hi, thanks for taking my questions. Really just some ticky-tack modeling questions on
the revenue side. Does the revenue guidance for the full year include any reduction in credit card late fees?

Citigroup,Fourth Quarter 2023,STEVEN CHUBAK,OTHER,"Got it. And just on the earlier comments you made, Mark, around Services NII. I am
struggling to reconcile the 50/50 NII contribution from rate and volume components, just given average loan
to deposits were essentially flat year-on-year, NII grew $3 billion. It does imply a much larger contribution
from rates. I know there's deposit funds transfer pricing and other noise. So I was hoping maybe you could
unpack that a little bit further.",74,20,72,0.6,general_discussion
Citigroup,Fourth Quarter 2023,MARK MASON,OTHER,"I mean, there are a lot of factors in there. There's obviously, as well, the mix as it relates to
