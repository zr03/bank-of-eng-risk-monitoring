Citigroup,First,JANE FRASER,OTHER,"Thank you, Jenn, hello to everyone joining us today. Well, 2023 is shaping up to be another
interesting year, given the tumultuous events of the last few weeks. I am going to share some observations,
and then we'll turn to what was a good quarter.
First, our banking system as a whole is very strong. While a small handful of institutions still have challenges
to overcome, the U.S. financial system remains unmatched globally. And I feel confident saying that as
someone who has worked in many different systems around the world.
The U.S. system comprises a healthy mix of community banks, regional banks and global banks including
Citi. We all have important but different roles to play, serving different clients with different needs and on
different scales. I would also point to the rapid response by state, federal and international regulators that
helped reinforce confidence in the system at a critical juncture.
I am pleased that Citi has been a source of stability for the financial system and a source of strength for our
clients.
We are in a position to play this role because our strategy is delivering a simpler, more focused bank. We
benefit from a diversified earnings base and resilient business model. This is reinforced by our robust balance
sheet management, liquidity position and strong risk management frameworks. We are disciplined in how
we run the firm, from client selection to capital planning.
And it is also thanks to our people. I want to express my pride in our colleagues around the world who have
worked tirelessly last month to serve clients as they turned to Citi as a port in the storm.
Recent events have shown that prudent asset and liability management is absolutely paramount. While

Citi First Quarter 2023 Earnings Review
April 14, 2023
Mark is going to walk you through our approach and our focus on interest rate risk, liquidity, and capital, I do
want to mention a few things.
In terms of assets, our loans are high-quality and short-duration. We have highly-liquid investment
securities and a significant amount of cash. We have over $1 trillion of available liquidity resources, including
$584 billion of HQLA and an LCR of 120%. And we maintain a diverse set of funding sources, including over
$1.3 trillion of deposits across corporates, consumers, industries, and regions, many of which are operational
in nature.
The cornerstone is our institutional deposit base, which comprises about 60% of our deposits. Most of these
deposits are particularly sticky because they sit in operating accounts that are fully integrated into how our
multinational clients run their businesses around the world from their payrolls to their supply chains to
their cash and liquidity management. 80% of these deposits are with clients who use all three of our
integrated services- payments & collections, liquidity management and working capital solutions.
The data that we aggregate from these deposits and their related flows is fundamental to how our clients
manage their efficiency, risk and compliance. This greatly increases our deposit stickiness. And that is also
why nearly 80% of these deposits are from client relationships that are 15 years old or more.
Finally, we operate a strong risk framework that looks at both asset and liability concentrations across client
segment, industry, and region, and we are confident in the size and nature of our exposures given our
rigorous stress testing. We also diligently manage counterparty risk, which is critical given the
interconnectedness of financial institutions.
We are in a strong position to navigate whatever environment we face which is particularly relevant given
the degree of uncertainty today.
The Fed continues to use rate policy to battle inflation, which has been more than stubborn in services, even
as we see signs of cooling in labor and manufacturing. We expect the recent events to be disinflationary and
credit to contract. We believe it is now more likely that the U.S. will enter into a shallow recession later this
biggest unknown is the impact on terminal short-term US interest rates and, of course, how the debt ceiling
plays out.
In Europe, the ECB is on a similar, but more difficult, quest to tame inflation. They have had some help from
lower-than-expected energy prices and the outlook continues to be a bit brighter. However, the war in
Ukraine sadly shows no sign of ending and Europe faces more structural challenges such as the need for
increased defense spending, higher energy costs and fiscal burdens that will make efforts to dampen
inflation and stimulate growth more difficult.
In Asia, the reopening of China is adding to the momentum in the region although the Chinese consumer has
been slower to rebound than expected. I saw many green shoots firsthand talking to our clients and our
bankers in my various trips to India, Japan, and Hong Kong this year. We have to keep a close eye on
geopolitics as the US-China relationship becomes increasingly strained and is fragmenting economic blocs.
We see this translate into shifts in flows and heightened cross-border volume across TTS and our global
network.
of $2.19. We had good revenue growth of 6% ex-divestitures and both revenue and expenses were in line
with our guidance. Our ROTCE of nearly 11% benefitted from the closing of the sales of our consumer
businesses in India and Vietnam and would have been over 9% without those gains.

Citi First Quarter 2023 Earnings Review
April 14, 2023
Let me highlight our operating performance in each of our five core businesses.
In Services, TTS continued to go from strength to strength, with revenues up 31%. Non-interest revenue was
up 11% quarter-on-quarter-on the back of increased cross-border activity and good performance in
commercial cards due to the rebound of corporate travel. Securities Servic
23% as we executed on new mandates, onboarded new AUC and benefitted from higher rates.
Within Markets, our Fixed Income revenues were up 4% from a year ago. We benefitted from excellent
performance in Rates and continued engagement from our corporate clients. The first quarter of 2022 was
no slouch, as you may recall, but this quarter was our third-best in a decade. Equities was weaker however -
down markedly in both derivatives and cash, but still had revenues north of $1 billion.
Banking was down again, but there were signs of the beginning of a rebound, including increased activity in
the investment grade debt market.
In US Personal Banking, our cards businesses gained momentum as all drivers continue to normalize to pre-
COVID levels. Branded Cards and Retail Services saw revenues up 18% and 24% respectively. Retail Banking
saw some growth as we continue to see good momentum in mortgages and installment lending and also
experienced a significant increase in digital deposits.
We did see a notable softening in consumer spending growth over the course of the quarter. Travel and
entertainment continued to grow in March, but essentials were flat, and almost all other spend categories
were down. Savings rates are below historic averages. While the upper quintiles of household income still
have roughly a trillion dollars in excess savings, the savings of the lower quintiles have been significantly
drawn down. So we are keeping a diligent eye on the lower FICO bands as economic growth and services
spend slow.
Finally, we remain confident about the prospects of our Wealth business. Despite the challenging
headwinds, growth in Citigold accounts, client acquisition and client advisors were all solid and we expect
these drivers to flow through to revenue later this year and beyond. We also saw the early signs of a long-
awaited Asian recovery.
We built credit reserves this quarter on the back of growth in revolving balances in cards and poorer macro-
outlooks. NCLs continued to normalize in Consumer while the health of our corporate base was evident in
another quarter of very low NCLs.
Finally, we continue to generate capital through our earnings. With our CET1 ratio now at 13.4%, we have
room to absorb the temporary, upfront impact should we sign a deal for Mexico. As you know, we continue
to pursue a dual path here. And we are committed to increasing the amount of capital we return to our
shareholders over time.
As you can see from slide three, in addition to good operating performance from our businesses and, despite
everything else going on in the industry, we got a lot done this quarter as we implement the strategy that we
shared with you at Investor Day.
We closed the sales of our consumer businesses in India and Vietnam. Indonesia and Taiwan are next on the
list to close later in the year. Our Asian consumer sales will then be complete, and we are intensifying our
efforts to eliminate stranded costs and simplify our organizational structure.
We made some significant leadership announcements. I am delighted that Andy Sieg will join Citi at my table
as the new head of Wealth Management. Andy is a widely respected leader in this space and comes to us
after running an $18 billion business with $2.8 trillion in client balances. He is the latest and the most visible
example of the excellent talent we have attracted over the last couple of years.

Citigroup,First,MARK MASON,OTHER,"Thank you, Jane, and good morning, everyone. I am going to start with the Firmwide
financial results, focusing on year-over-year comparisons for the first quarter unless I indicate otherwise,
and spend a little more time on expenses, our balance sheet and capital. Then I will turn to the results of
each segment.
On slide 4, we show financial results for the full firm. In the first quarter, we reported net income of
approximately $4.6 billion and an EPS of $2.19 and a RoTCE of nearly 11% on $21.4 billion of revenues.
Embedded in these results are pre-tax divestiture-related impacts of approximately $950 million, largely
driven by the gain on sale of the India consumer business. Excluding these items, EPS was $1.86 with an
RoTCE of over 9%. In the quarter, total revenues increased by 12% on a reported basis and increased 6%
excluding divestiture-related impacts as strength across Services, Fixed Income and .S Personal Banking
was partially offset by declines in Investment Banking, Equity Markets and Wealth, as well as the revenue
reduction from the closed exits and wind-downs.
Our results include expenses of $13.3 billion, an increase of 1% versus the prior year. Excluding divesture-
related costs in the prior year, expenses increased by 5% largely driven by the transformation, other risk &
control investments and inflation, partially offset by productivity savings and the expense reductions from
the exits and wind-downs.
Cost of credit was approximately $2.0 billion, primarily driven by the continued normalization in Card net
credit losses and ACL and other provision builds of approximately $700 million, largely related to a
deterioration in macroeconomic assumptions and growth in card revolving balances.
At the end of the quarter, we had nearly $20 billion in total reserves with a reserve-to-funded loans ratio of
approximately 2.7%.
On Slide 5, we show an expense walk for the first quarter, with the key underlying drivers. Transformation
investments drove ~1% of the growth largely in the data, finance and risk and control programs. And 4% of
the increase is driven by structural, largely in the form of compensation and benefits including the full-year
impact of the people we hired last year as well as those we hired in the first quarter.
Embedded in this structural bucket are a few key items. First, other risk and control investments that are
enterprise wide and in the businesses make up about 2% of the total expense increase. Second, the impact

of additional front and back-office hires. Third, inflation and severance costs. All of this was partially offset
by productivity savings as well as the benefit from foreign exchange translation and the expense reduction
from the exits and across the firm, technology-related expenses grew 12%.
We recognize these investments have driven a significant increase in expenses, but they are crucial to
modernize the firm, address the consent orders and position Citi for success in the years to come.
investing in and the benefits we will see over time.
In many cases, these investments will simplify our processes and platforms. For example, we are retiring
and consolidating 20 cash equities platforms to one single modern platform, eliminating costs over time.
And we have consolidated 11 platforms to one global sanctions-screening platform, reducing false alerts,
improving the client experience and eliminating costs.
We are also modernizing our infrastructure and the security of our data and information by enhancing cyber
security through the use of AI and improving the security of our infrastructure and devices, leading to fewer
operating losses. And we are leveraging industry-leading cloud-based solutions to modernize and
streamline the connectivity between our front office systems and the general ledger, eliminating manual
processes and operating costs over time.
We are driving the strategy by investing in the client experience both in terms of our technology interface
and innovative new products. We launched our cloud-based instant payments platform for eCommerce
clients in TTS. We are also deploying CitiDirect Commercial Banking, our mobile and digital interface for
Commercial clients so they too can open accounts and access all products and services across ICG in the
same way our Large Corporate clients do. And finally, we are investing in data to create advanced decision
making, client targeting, and risk management capabilities which has allowed us to enhance our returns
through greater RWA efficiency. And we expect many of these investments to generate efficiencies that will
allow us to self-fund future investments over time.
first quarter, net interest income increased by approximately $80 million, largely driven by interest-earning
balances in cards. Average loans were up slightly as growth in PBWM was largely offset by a decline in ICG.
Average deposits were also up slightly, driven by growth in both PBWM and ICG. And our net interest margin
increased 2 basis points.
On Slide 8, we show key consumer and corporate credit metrics. We are well reserved for the current
environment with nearly $20 billion of reserves. Our reserves-to-funded loans ratio is approximately 2.7%.
And within that, US Cards is 8.1%. In PBWM, 44% of our lending exposures are in US cards and of that
exposure, nearly 80% is to customers with FICOs of 680 or higher.
And NCL rates, while reflecting some typical seasonality this quarter, are still below pre-COVID levels and
are normalizing in line with our expectations. The remaining 56% of our PBWM lending exposure is largely
in Wealth and predominantly mortgages and margin lending. In our ICG portfolio, of our total exposure,
approximately 85% is investment grade. Of the international exposure, approximately 90% is investment
grade or exposure to multinational clients or their subsidiaries. And corporate non-accrual loans remain
low at about 40 basis points of total loans.
As you can see on the page, we break out our Commercial Real Estate lending exposures across ICG and
PBWM which total $66 billion, of which 90% is investment grade. So, while the macro and geopolitical
environment remains uncertain, we feel very good about our asset quality, exposures and reserve levels
and we continuously review and stress the portfolio under a range of scenarios.

additional metrics to the page to provide additional transparency into how we manage the balance sheet.
We maintain a very strong $2.5 trillion balance sheet which is funded in part by a well-diversified $1.3
trillion deposit base across regions, industries, customers and account types which is deployed into high-
quality, diversified assets.
Our balance sheet is a reflection of our strategy and well diversified business model. We leverage our unique
assets and capabilities to serve corporates, financial institutions, investors, and individuals with global
needs. First, the majority of our deposits, $819 billion, are institutional, and span 90 countries. And the
majority of these institutional deposits tend to be interest rate sensitive so when rates go up, we reprice
the deposits accordingly, but that reprice takes into account the overall client relationship as well as the
level of rates.
But despite this interest rate sensitivity, these deposits tend to be stable as they are tied to the operational
services we provide. And these institutional deposits are complemented by $437 billion of US Retail
consumer and global wealth deposits as you can see on the bottom right side of the page. These deposits
are well diversified across the Private Bank, Citigold, Retail and Wealth at Work as well as across regions
and products, with 75% of US Citigold clients and approximately 50% of ultra-high net worth clients having
been with Citi for more than 10 years. Our wealth deposits tend to also be interest rate sensitive, but this
usually results in our customers moving to higher-yielding investment and deposit products.
Now turning to the asset side, at a high-level, you can think about our deposits being largely deployed in
three asset buckets loans, investment securities and cash which complement the interest rate
sensitivity and liquidity value of our liabilities. And this deployment is also linked to our strategy we use
our resources to lend and transact with our clients in ways that deepen the relationship and drive returns
for our shareholders while maintaining strong liquidity and capital.
Our $652 billion loan portfolio is well diversified across consumer and corporate loans. And the duration of
the total portfolio is approximately 1.3 years as the majority of these loans are variable-rate. About 35% of
our balance sheet is in cash and investment securities which contribute to our $1 trillion of available
liquidity resources. And at the end of the quarter, we had an LCR of 120%, which means we have roughly
$100 billion of HQLA in excess of the amount required by the rule to cover stressed outflows. And you can
see the details of this on page 27 in the appendix. But just as important as the quantum of liquidity is the
composition and duration of that liquidity.
And our $513 billion investment portfolio consists largely of highly liquid US Treasury, Agency and other
sovereign bonds, and is split evenly between available-for-sale and held-to-
maintained a short duration of less than three years so we could benefit from higher interest rates.
And we actively and prudently manage our assets and liabilities by considering a range of possible stress
scenarios and how they might impact interest rate risk, liquidity, and capital.
So, in summary, our assets and liabilities are aligned across interest rate sensitivity, liquidity value and
duration, and reflect the diversified business model and execution of our strategy.
On Slide 10, we show a sequential CET1 walk to provide more detail on the drivers this quarter. Walking from
the end of fourth quarter. First, we generated $4.3 billion of net income to common which added 38 basis
points. Second, we returned $1.0 billion in the form of common dividends, which drove a reduction of about
9 basis points. Third, impact on AOCI through our AFS investment portfolio drove a 7 basis point increase.
And finally, the remaining 4 basis point increase was largely driven by the RWA benefit from closing our
consumer exits.

April 14, 2023
We ended the quarter with a 13.4% CET1 capital ratio, approximately 40 basis points higher than last
quarter, and this includes a 100 basis point internal management buffer.
And as it relates to buybacks, we did not buy back any stock this quarter and we will continue to make that
decision on a quarter-by-quarter basis.
On Slide 11, we show the results for our Institutional Clients Group for the first quarter. Revenues were up
1% this quarter, largely driven by Services and Fixed income, mostly offset by Investment Banking and
Equities. Expenses increased 4%, driven by transformation, other risk and control investments and
volume-related expenses, partially offset by FX translation and productivity savings.
Cost of credit was a $72 million benefit, as an ACL release more than offset net credit losses. This resulted
in net income of approximately $3.3 billion, up 23%, driven by the lower cost of credit and higher revenues,
partially offset by higher expenses. ICG delivered a 13.8% RoTCE for the quarter.
And average loans were down 2% reflecting discipline around our strategy and returns. Average deposits
were up 3% as we continued to acquire new clients and deepen relationships with existing ones. And
sequentially, average deposits were up 1%. And on an end of period basis, ICG deposits were down 3%
sequentially, driven by seasonality as our clients tend to make tax payments in the first quarter.
On Slide 12, we show revenue performance by business and the key drivers we laid out at Investor Day. In
Treasury and Trade Solutions, revenues were up 31%, driven by 41% growth in net interest income and 13%
in NIR, with growth across all client segments. We continue to see healthy underlying drivers in TTS that
indicate consistently strong client activity with US Dollar Clearing Volumes up 6%, reflecting continued
SWIFT share gains. Cross-border flows up 10%, outpacing global GDP growth. Commercial card volumes
up roughly 40%, led by spend in travel.
So, while the rate environment drove about 60% of the growth this quarter, business actions drove the
remaining 40%, as we continued to deepen relationships with existing clients and win new clients. In fact,
client wins are up approximately 50%, across all segments. These include marquee transactions where we
In Securities Services, revenues grew 23% as net interest income grew 94%, driven by higher interest rates
across currencies, partially offset by a 6% decrease in non-interest revenue due to the impact of market
valuations. We are pleased with the execution in Securities Services as we continue to onboard assets
under custody and administration from significant client wins and we feel very good about the pipeline of
new deals. As a reminder, the Services businesses are central to our strategy and are two of our higher-
returning businesses with strong linkages across the firm.
Markets revenues were down 4% as growth in Fixed Income was more than offset by Equities. Fixed Income
revenues were up 4%, relative to a very strong quarter last year, as strength in our Rates franchise was
partially offset by a decline in FX and Commodities. Equities revenues were down 25%, also relative to a
strong quarter last year, primarily reflecting reduced client activity in Cash and Equity Derivatives.
Corporate client flows remained strong and stable and we continued to make solid progress on our
revenue-to-RWA target
And finally, Banking revenues, excluding gains and losses on loan hedges, were down 21%, driven by
Investment Banking, as heightened macro uncertainty and volatility continued to impact client activity.
Having said that, we do see revenue growth sequentially largely driven by the investment grade market
opening up.

April 14, 2023
So overall, while the market environment remains challenging, we feel good about the progress we are
making in ICG.
Now turning to Slide 13, we show the results for our Personal Banking & Wealth Management business.
Revenues were up 9%, driven by net interest income growth of 10%, partially offset by a 1% decline in non-
interest revenue, driven by lower investment product revenues in Wealth.
Expenses were also up 9%, predominantly driven by investments in transformation and other risk and
control initiatives.
Cost of credit was $1.6 billion, driven by higher net credit losses as we continue to see normalization in our
card portfolios and a reserve build of approximately $500 million, largely driven by a deterioration in
macroeconomic assumptions and card revolving balance growth.
Average loans increased 7% driven by cards, mortgages and installment lending. Average deposits
decreased 3%, largely reflecting our Wealth clients putting cash to work in fixed income investments on our
platform. And PBWM delivered an RoTCE of 5.5%, largely driven by higher credit costs.
On Slide 14, we show PBWM revenues by product as well as key business drivers and metrics. Branded
Cards revenues were up 18%, driven by higher net interest income. We continue to see strong underlying
drivers with new account acquisitions up 17%, card spend volumes up 9% and average loans up 15%. Retail
Services revenues were up 24%, also driven by higher net interest income.
For both Card portfolios, we continue to see payment rates decline, and that combined with the
investments we have been making contributed to growth in interest-earning balances of 18% in Branded
Cards and 11% in Retail Services.
Retail Banking revenues were up 3%, primarily driven by higher mortgage revenue and strong growth in
personal installment lending, partially offset by the impact of the transfer of relationships and the
associated deposits to our Wealth business. In fact, consistent with the strategy, we continued to leverage
our retail network to drive over 13,000 Wealth referrals in the first quarter.
Wealth revenues were down 9%, driven by continued investment fee headwinds and higher deposit costs
particularly in the Private Bank. However, we did see notable improvement in revenues in Asia which were
up approximately 20% on a sequential basis.
Client advisors were up 3%. And we are seeing net new investment inflows and strong new client
acquisitions across our Wealth business, with new clients in the Private Bank and Wealth at Work up 62%
and 81%, respectively.
While the environment continues to remain challenging for Wealth, we are seeing strong underlying
business drivers as we execute against our strategy.
On Slide 15, we show results for Legacy Franchises. Revenues grew 48%, driven by a gain on the sale of our
consumer business in India, partially offset by the wind-downs and closed consumer exits. Expenses
decreased 24%, largely driven by the absence of a goodwill impairment we had in the prior year as well as
the impact of the wind-downs and closed consumer exits.
On Slide 16, we show results for Corporate Other for the first quarter. Revenues increased, largely driven by
higher net revenue from the investment portfolio. Expenses increased, driven by transformation and other
risk and control investments, partially offset by a reduction in consulting fees.

Citigroup,First,"QUESTION AND ANSWER
OPERATOR",MODERATOR,Our first question will come from Glenn Schorr with Evercore. Your line is now open.,15,9,11,0.6,qa_session
Citigroup,First,GLENN SCHORR,OTHER,"Hi, thank you, a simple one. I appreciate the many, many moving parts, but your first
quarter NII and revenue production was great, and if you just annualize it, you're handily ahead of your full
year guide. So I'm just curious on how you're thinking about maintaining the guide but running ahead of
schedule.",54,9,12,0.6,opening_remarks
Citigroup,First,MARK MASON,OTHER,"Yeah, thanks, Glenn, and good morning. Appreciate the question. Look, we did have a very
solid first quarter, but as Jane mentioned in her prepared remarks, there are a number of things that are still
out there in the global macro environment that are uncertain and unclear, including, frankly, as we
contemplate the direction of rates and what's required to tame inflation, let alone the uncertainty that
we've seen in parts of the sector here through the quarter.
And so when I think about that and I think about how frankly betas have evolved and the likelihood of a
recession in the back half of the year, which we have built into our outlook, I remain comfortable with the
guidance that we've set here. And when you think about where that comes from, the strength in TTS, the
strength in Securities Services, both benefiting from the rate hikes we saw last year, but also deepening
relationships with new and existing clients, the Card momentum, which is really about seeing more
revolving activity as payment rates start to slow, and the recovery in Investment Banking and Wealth is not
as swift as we would like and so we have to see how that plays out too.
So when I put those things together, there's certainly some puts and takes that speaks to the diversification
of our business model, but it leaves me in a place where I'm comfortable with the guidance that we've set,
and if that changes, we'll certainly update you, but that's where we are.",256,9,13,0.6,opening_remarks
Citigroup,First,GLENN SCHORR,OTHER,"I appreciate that. Maybe if I could follow-up on your comments, the previous ones on TTS
and Securities Services. I try to learn from all my mistakes, I make a lot of them, but in 2008 we thought
housing prices couldn't go down much, and then they went down a lot, and we all adapt. The same thing in
March, thought deposits couldn't leave a bank so quickly, but they did.
So, slide 25 and 26 people should look at because they're great and they show the stability of your deposit
franchise, but I'm curious if history can change at all. Meaning right now, those are cash and operating
deposits that clients keep with you and they need you, and you're fully integrated, but do you have client
concentrations we should know about or are you thinking about any big changes that can happen in terms
of client behavior relative to the past in terms of what they keep at any given bank? I know it's a tough one.
Copyright © 2023 Citigroup Inc. 9",175,9,14,0.6,general_discussion
Citigroup,First,JANE FRASER,OTHER,"Glenn, I'll kick it off and pass it over to Mark. I feel very comfortable about how very well-
diversified our deposit base is across different countries, industries, clients, and currencies. It's extremely
strong in that respect, and as you say, the majority of the Institutional deposits are integrated into the
operating accounts all around the world to enable the clients to run their day-to-day operations, the
payroll, the working capital, the supplier financing, et cetera.
And I think what's changed in the more digital world is frankly these have become even stickier because the
amount of data, the extent of integration into the technology platforms and systems of the clients and the
value that we extract and present back to the clients from the combination of our FX trade, cash, et cetera,
flows, is incredibly important in driving their efficiency, their risk management, and their financial
performance as well. So both the extent of that diversification and the increasing stickiness versus history
is something that we're certainly not complacent about, but I think is why you see from the pages we've put
into the deck as well including in the back on just the consistency of this base.
Mark, what would you add?",204,10,15,0.6,risk_discussion
Citigroup,First,MARK MASON,OTHER,"I think that's exactly right, Jane, and Glenn, I'm glad you pointed out pages 25 and 26 which
clearly lay out that diversification but also the scale and stability of those deposits over an extended period
of time.
The only thing I'd add additional to that would be obviously we're in an environment where there's
quantitative tightening that's occurring. That's going to have a broad industry impact as we've started to
see already, but we're also in an environment where rates are increasing. We'll see how that plays out
through the balance of the year. That has an impact on betas, but we shouldn't mistake price-sensitivity or
interest rate sensitivity with the stickiness of the deposits. And so we've obviously talked about betas
increasing particularly in our TTS portfolio, more so in the US. It obviously will continue to increase outside
of the US, but we'll work the relationship that we have with those clients and the breadth of services that
we bring to influence and impact pricing, and more importantly, because of the operating nature of them,

Citigroup,First,MIKE MAYO,OTHER,"Hi, Jane, I challenged you a couple earnings calls ago about the complexity created by being in
so many countries, and you said TTS was your crown jewel, and here it's up almost one-third year-over-year,
so, so far so good since your Investor Day.
Can you talk about for the fee growth? I mean, we kind of understand the NII growth, but the fee growth is
double-digits also, so I guess that's money in motion and I think you described this as the world's largest
wholesale global payments system. What's happening to give you double-digit top line growth there?",99,10,18,0.6,financial_results
Citigroup,First,JANE FRASER,OTHER,"Oh, thank you, Mike, and a great question. I think one of the numbers I'm almost more happy
about than the stellar revenue growth was the fee growth quarter-over-quarter here because obviously,
we've been benefiting in TTS from the rates environment but we've also been benefiting from the drivers
behind the franchise. And the fee revenues are coming from multiple different products and different
offerings that we have here, and we're typically looking and have consistently looked at growing our fee
revenue as a percentage of the underlying growth in TTS.
It got masked a bit when the rates environment was growing so much, but the different areas there around
the world are making a big difference to the strength of our earnings and the quality of our earnings in these

Citigroup,First,MIKE MAYO,OTHER,"Okay. And then as it relates to rates generally, what is it, like, over 90% of your rate sensitivity
is outside the US, and so shouldn't you be benefiting more than you originally thought given some of these
rate hikes? And I guess, Mark, are you just sandbagging a little bit? I get the uncertainties and the IB backlog
pushed out, and, no I mean, we want you to have a reasonable bar to jump over and I'm just wondering if
you set the bar high enough for yourself for this year.",92,11,20,0.6,general_discussion
Citigroup,First,MARK MASON,OTHER,"Yeah, so again, I think that there is certainly more opportunity in terms of how rates move
and capturing NII as you pointed out outside of the US. We articulate our interest rate exposure for a parallel
shift and that mix at the end of last year was the 90/10 that you mentioned for non-US. As I sit here in
March, it probably is going to skew a little bit less non-US and a little bit more towards the US, and you'll
see that in the 10-Q.
With that said, I mentioned earlier, there's still a bit of uncertainty in terms of how rates continue to evolve
here in the US. We'll see how betas evolve. We've reached terminal betas in the US with our clients kind of
at the end of last year, and so we'll see kind of what happens in terms of pricing through the balance of
2023.
Betas are not quite at terminal levels outside of the US, and so we'll see the pacing of that, again, in light of
how the interest rate curve may be evolving and frankly in light of how we've seen the broader sector turmoil
play out. That could in fact play to our benefit. But we are also, again, in an environment where there's
quantitative tightening that is still at play.
And then the final point I'd make, Mike, that often people forget is that in that NII is Legacy NII, and so as
we continue with our wind-downs, our divestitures, et cetera, that's going to be a headwind that we will
have to deal with.",266,11,21,0.6,general_discussion

coming on board, and I just wanted to understand how to think about the outlook for what you're doing
with Wealth, not only in the US but the non-US locations, and also try to understand how much capital you
think you could apply to that business relative to what you have today. Thanks.",69,11,23,0.6,opening_remarks
Citigroup,First,JANE FRASER,OTHER,"Hey there Betsy. So, we're obviously delighted that Andy is joining as our new Global Head
of Wealth around my table, and he's a tremendous leader with a great track record driving growth. He's got
deep product and digital expertise; a proven people leader and we'll certainly be taking full advantage of his
expertise and experience in the US.
We're not shifting our strategy in Wealth. His mandate is consistent with the strategy we laid out at Investor
Day. We see a lot of potential of growth in Asia as we fill in the coverage across the full wealth spectrum
there. We'll be scaling up in the US by building out the investment offering and cross-selling into our
existing and new clients across the country. We see tremendous potential of growth in our Private Bank
and the family office franchise really around the world, and there's a lot of synergies to be realized as we
point out in the different KPIs and drivers between the other four core businesses in terms of referrals and
other business that we're able to generate across the franchise.
So the core of the strategy will not be changing with him coming on board. Mark, what else would you add
in?

Citigroup,First,MARK MASON,OTHER,"The only thing I'd add is that, we are, I think, well-positioned for as the market recovers and
it plays towards Wealth. When you look at kind of the client advisors, as you know, we've been investing in
bringing on new client advisors. We've been increasing the number of new clients that we've been
onboarding as well. We've invested in some of the investment products that we have, and so I feel like we
are positioning ourselves for when this turns.
And as it relates to your question regarding capital, this in a normal cycle is a very healthy returning
business, and as the market turns and as we recover, we would look to deploy capital appropriate with the
growth and return prospects that we see in front of us.
It's also not as much of a capital-intensive business as other businesses, and so I think you've got to keep
both of those things in mind.",156,12,25,0.6,qa_session

Citigroup,First,ERIKA NAJARIAN,OTHER,"Hi. Good morning. And I think it's remarkable that your first two questions were
essentially saying that your revenues are too conservative, so that's very notable for a Citi call.
My first question is a follow-up to Betsy. I think everybody were certainly impressed, Jane, at the Andy Sieg
hire, and clearly, he was running a much larger business than what Citi has today. And this is sort of a tricky
question. Clearly, you're still working through some of the transformation. There's still a consent order, but
given your strength as a global player, could Citi participate in perhaps inorganic opportunities that could
be out there, having a result perhaps of the liquidity crisis that we saw that could potentially enhance your
Wealth Management footprint more quickly?",127,12,27,0.6,opening_remarks
Citigroup,First,JANE FRASER,OTHER,"We see plenty of potential for organic growth potential, and I think that's really where we're
going to be focusing, Erika, because I look at the Private Bank and the family office, there is so much wealth
creation supplemented by our Commercial Banking relationships with a lot of the enterprises and the owners
of those enterprises who are really generating the new industry champions in country after country, and we're
extremely well-positioned to capture that.
I don't see an inorganic play that would actually help us on it. We also benefit because we don't have our own
proprietary products and a sales force pushing those proprietary products. We're an open architecture, and
therefore, we're a very desirable partner for many of our key partners on the Institutional side of the business
to be able to provide very interesting value propositions, investment opportunities and the like to our clients
around the world.
And finally, we can see certainly areas in interesting digital plays, different partnerships, areas like that that
are of interest. So I'll never say never in the longer-run. I'm sure if something very attractive comes up, we'll be
very interested and looking at it, but it's not something right now that I think makes sense, given where we're
focused. Actually almost independent of the consent orders, I think what we're looking at doing right now is
getting this organic play right and then we'll see from there.",238,12,28,0.6,general_discussion

our Wealth business, and there's a lot of embedded opportunity and it really speaks to the integrated model
that we've been talking about.",35,12,29,0.6,general_discussion
Citigroup,First,JANE FRASER,OTHER,"And I think the other bit I'd also just point to is I think one of the things we do benefit from is that
we aren't constrained by being dominated by a brokerage model in a particular way of doing Wealth, so part of
the mandate for Andy and the ones that we've been working on to date is really looking at what is modern
Wealth Management and making sure that we are really well-positioned that way, because I do think that will
be more of the way of the future.

Citigroup,First,OPERATOR,MODERATOR,Thank you. Our next question will come from Jim Mitchell with Seaport Global. Your line is open.,17,13,31,0.6,opening_remarks
Citigroup,First,JIM MITCHELL,OTHER,"Hey, good morning. Maybe just a question on capital. Appreciate the fact that the potential
sale of the Mexico franchise would be a negative impact, but you're sitting at a pretty comfortable cushion
now above your target. Obviously your expected future retained earnings growth should be more than an
offset, so how do we think about, how are you thinking about the timing of restarting buybacks with your
stock as cheap as it is?",74,13,32,0.6,opening_remarks
Citigroup,First,MARK MASON,OTHER,"Yeah, thanks, Jim, and good morning. As you point out, we grew capital pretty sizably this
quarter, up to 13.4% from a CET1 ratio point of view and up significantly from a year ago, some 200 basis
points or so. And a good portion of that, a significant portion of that, was really net income earnings
generation, which is important.
Look, the way we think about it is that 13.4%, we certainly have well-above what's required from a regulatory
point of view and it includes our internal management buffer of about 100 basis points. But as we've said in
the past, there is certainly the Mexico transaction and that would be a temporary drag to CET1 at signing, the
difference between signing and closing if it were a sale to take place. And then there are a couple of other
factors that are out there as well.
So think about the Basel III end game that's out there and the capital requirements that could come out of
that. Think about the CCAR DFAST that has been submitted and currently under review, and what that might
mean for stress capital buffers, and also think about just where we are in the broader economy and broader
global macro environment that we're playing in and needing to see how that kind of evolves. And so when I
think about all of those factors, we're in a place where we will continue to take it quarter-by-quarter, but I'd
end by saying our bias is kind of where yours is, which is given where we're trading, all things being equal,
we'd like to be buying back shares, but we have to be responsible about that and the timing of that.",285,13,33,0.6,opening_remarks
Citigroup,First,JANE FRASER,OTHER,"I think we'll have more clarity fairly soon around a number of the factors, so we'll be able to
give you better clarity on timing before too long.",28,13,34,0.6,general_discussion
Citigroup,First,JIM MITCHELL,OTHER,"Yeah, all fair. And then maybe as a follow-up, just, you mentioned increased macro
assumptions embedded in reserves. Where are you now on the macro assumptions in the reserve book?",30,13,35,0.6,general_discussion
Citigroup,First,MARK MASON,OTHER,"So in terms of the reserve, again, remember we have a couple of different scenarios that we
run when we calculate the CECL reserves. Our current reserves are based on those three macroeconomic
scenarios. It reflects a 5.1% or so unemployment rate on a weighted basis over eight quarters, so that's
relatively flat versus last quarter.
The other point worth mentioning is that in this particular calculation for the quarter, we did skew a little bit
more towards the downside in terms of the probability weighting than last quarter, in light of the macro
environment and the combination of that as well as some normalization in the portfolio including an increase
in revolver activity contributed to the increase in reserves we saw.
But to answer your question, unemployment at about 5.1% for the weighted basis over the eight quarters.",139,13,36,0.6,qa_session

Citigroup,First,STEVEN CHUBAK,OTHER,"Hey, good morning. So I wanted to start off with a question just on the IB and trading
outlook. On the trading side, just given some of the recent macro shocks, have you seen any evidence of bad
volatility and are you still confident that you can sustain that mid-single-digit growth target? And just on the
Investment Banking side, I wanted to see if there's any evidence of green shoots. It's been a challenging
Copyright © 2023 Citigroup Inc. 13",80,13,38,0.6,opening_remarks
Citigroup,First,MARK MASON,OTHER,"Why don't I start, and then, Jane, feel free to jump in. Look, we saw better performance in
the quarter in Markets than when I talked at the conference earlier in the quarter. And really that played
through in our Fixed Income business which was up about 4% year-over-year driven largely by strength in
Rates and we saw rate volatility in the back end of the quarter and we were well-positioned to take
advantage of that and serve clients and that aided getting us to down 4% in aggregate across Markets.
What we talked about for the full year is kind of relatively flat performance, and I still think that based on
what we see today and subject to how the macro continues to evolve that we'll be able to deliver on that.
But as you know, volatility in many instances plays to the favor of Markets businesses, and so there's a bit
of an unknown as to how that evolves. But I feel confident in the guidance that we've given thus far on that.",175,14,39,0.6,financial_results
Citigroup,First,JANE FRASER,OTHER,"Yeah, I'd jump in before you turn to Banking as well. I think one of the differences with our
franchise compared to some others is that we are the go-to bank for corporates, and that provides a highly
attractive but pretty steady flow of activity. This is obviously in the volatile markets we've been seeing is from
our perspective very good volatility because we're able to support our clients in rates, FX, commodity
hedging, and it makes our risk flows much more diversified than our competitors particularly in volatile
markets like this. We're not taking positions. This is really attractive client flow business right at the heart of
the global network.
The other piece that I think is important in the mix here too is just the partnership with TTS, cross-border
payments, these other elements and cornerstone of the FX franchise, so there's some pieces here of the
volatility that one doesn't usually think of this as being so client-heavy, but that's what's differentiating on
the Citi franchise.
Mark, back to you.",172,14,40,0.6,risk_discussion
Citigroup,First,MARK MASON,OTHER,"No, thank you, I think that's exactly right in terms of the corporate client base there. Look, in
Investment Banking, obviously the wallets were down meaningfully last year. We saw some good
performance in debt capital markets this quarter, up 66% versus the prior quarter, particularly as we saw
activity in the investment grade names, which is an area of strength for us for sure, and I think there was a
bit of momentum behind a bit more clarity on the direction of rates, and so we'll see how that continues to
evolve and play out.
The other thing I'd add is that we continue to have very good dialogue with clients as they manage through
the environment and try to anticipate what the balance of the year looks like, and at some point, it's clear
that clients are going to need to get back into the markets, but that trajectory is going to largely depend on
the geopolitical and macro environment and how we all manage and navigate that uncertainty.
So very engaged, healthy pipeline, but subject to how the environment continues to evolve.",185,14,41,0.6,opening_remarks
Citigroup,First,STEVEN CHUBAK,OTHER,"That's great. And for my follow-up, just on PBWM fee income trends, I'm not going to ask
you about the broader Wealth strategy, but we're big fans of Andy here, so congrats on the hire. The one thing
I did want to get a better sense of is how much of the sequential improvement that we saw in fees is a
function of just partner payments being higher as credit continues to normalize, and how we should be
thinking about the trajectory in fees within PBWM over the remainder of this year?",92,14,42,0.6,financial_results
Citigroup,First,MARK MASON,OTHER,"I think there are a couple of things to kind of keep in mind in terms of PBWM fees, and I
think part of it is that PBWM is a combination of both the Cards business as well as the Wealth business,
and a good amount of the pressure that we've seen in fees and that is still subject to how the environment

line is open.",18,15,44,0.6,opening_remarks
Citigroup,First,EBRAHIM POONAWALA,OTHER,"Hey, good afternoon. Just a couple of quick questions. One, in terms of the
Banamex sale, I think, Jane, you mentioned that maybe we might hear something relatively soon and you still
are pursuing the dual track process. One, if you do decide to go the IPO route, does that change the
accounting dynamics, Mark, with regards to taking that hit early on if given just the time it might take to go
through an IPO. And the outlook for the Mexican economy, the banks continue to be robust. Is that impacting
or influencing how you're thinking about the value that you should get from this transaction?",107,15,45,0.6,opening_remarks
Citigroup,First,JANE FRASER,OTHER,"So, we're in a very active dialogue right now in Mexico, so neither Mark nor I are going to
comment in a lot of detail there. As you say, we're continuing to pursue a dual path, both a sale and an IPO,
so we'll have an exit strategy either way, and we'll take the path that is in the best interest of our
shareholders.
So we've got an enormous body of work going on in Mexico to separate out the Institutional business. I'm
pleased with the progress they're making. I think we're seeing, when we look at the performance of our
Mexican franchise, a lot of the really strong performance is happening in our ICG business where Mexico is
such a beneficiary of the supply chain dynamics that are happening around the world, and its location is
obviously very beneficial given the proximity to the US as well. So I think a lot of the dynamic and the big
benefits here coming in the institutional franchise that we're keeping within Citi as a core part of our
business.
So the current Mexican economy doesn't really have so much of an impact on our current decision-making.
The principle is we will take the path that is in the best interest of our shareholders.",212,15,46,0.6,general_discussion
Citigroup,First,MARK MASON,OTHER,"Yeah, and just to put some numbers to that, for the quarter, Mexico was up 16% revenue
year-over-year. Quarter-over-quarter up 5%, cards growth, deposit growth, so performing well I would say.
And in terms of the latter part of your question, Jane's exactly right. Everything we're doing is positioning us
for both a private sale and/or an IPO, and we'll choose the path that's best for shareholders. An IPO would
take longer. It would likely take longer as we would want a set of full audited financials, et cetera. I would
say that in terms of what the implications would be from an accounting point of view, CTA accounting is
different for an IPO so we would not recognize that CTA through the P&L in an IPO. We wouldn't have at
signing that impact that is different from that closing and so that would not be an issue.
The impact would be a matter of how much we IPO-ed at that time, so a lot of moving pieces there. We
would need to figure out if we ended up down that path, but hopefully that gives you some sense of the
scenarios there.
But I'd end with just one final point that Jane has made already, which is that the outcome that we choose

the curve means. Is that slowing expense growth, absolute drop, any kind of clarity on that, and costs in
general kind of medium-term would be helpful. Thank you.",85,16,49,0.6,opening_remarks
Citigroup,First,MARK MASON,OTHER,"Thank, Matt. To answer your question very directly, yes, it is still the case. We are going to
bend the curve, as I mentioned, towards the end of 2024. It does mean an absolute dollar reduction in
expenses.
Okay. That's helpful. And then, I think in the past you've kind of insinuated that's like
the start of hopefully a more material drop in costs beyond, obviously this is far away, but just any
additional color there too. Thank you.",79,16,50,0.6,opening_remarks
Citigroup,First,MARK MASON,OTHER,"Yeah, look, again, look, the expense base is a key area of focus for us, right? We recognize
that expenses have been growing. They've been growing because we've been investing in the franchise both
transformation-wise as well as business-led growth to support the competitive advantages that we have
in many of our franchises, but we're managing that very actively and very deliberately, and that means that
we're looking to ensure that we're spending the money in the right way in the right places and that we're
going to yield the benefits that we expect from that over time. And that was all factored into the targets that
we set at our Investor Day for the medium-term, and what that requires is that we start bending the curve
in 2024 as I stated and that we end in that medium-term at a place where we have an operating efficiency
of about 60% and we're positioned to have returns that are in that 11% to 12% RoTCE point of view.
There are a couple of factors that are going to contribute to lowering that expense base. One, the
divestitures that we've been talking about, right. The second is the benefits from the transformation and
other investments that I've just referenced. And the third is further organizational and management
simplification efforts that we have underway that are enabled by the idea that we're exiting 14 consumer
countries. And so those three factors, if you will, become very important to ensure that we get to that lower
cost structure and that we're able to deliver on the broader commitments that we're making with regards
to returns.",272,16,51,0.6,guidance

investment bank over in Switzerland, do you guys see changes coming, or what changes do you see coming
in terms of regulatory whether it's more capital, more liquidity, and it may not be directed at a company like
yours because you're a global SIFI already and it might be more regionally orientated in the United States.

noticed in your Card, I think it was slide 8, you give us the prime, 80% of the portfolio is prime, which is FICO
scores greater than 680. I don't know if you would agree with this statement, but we're hearing that there
was some FICO score inflation as a result of the pandemic. A lot of consumers saw their FICO scores go up,
and I've seen numbers as high as 70 points, that may be on the high side, but can you guys, do you agree
with that, and if you do, would you then expect the 700 FICO score customer at some point to behave like
a 650 score customer?",127,17,55,0.6,opening_remarks
Citigroup,First,JANE FRASER,OTHER,"I think the short answer is no, but let me let Mark answer that one.",15,17,56,0.6,qa_session
Citigroup,First,MARK MASON,OTHER,"I think what's really important here, Gerard, is kind of what we're seeing in the way of the
performance of the portfolio. So again, I've heard that sentiment regarding FICO score inflation. We feel very
confident in how we've assessed our customers and what it means to have 80% of our customers prime
and greater than 680. I think importantly, what we're seeing is we're seeing payment rates start to slow.
We're seeing average interest-earning balances start to increase. We're seeing NCL rates increase, but
particularly driven by the lower FICO score customers across the portfolio which is where you would expect
to start to see that drag occur, and the NCL rates that we're seeing are still well below what we would see
in a normal cycle and they're in line with what we've been forecasting for performance. So there are no
surprises that we're seeing in terms of how that curve is evolving. We'd expect that it will get back to those
normal levels towards the beginning of next year. It will likely play through those normal levels a bit before
tapering.
But my point here is that we understand our customers, the portfolio, and how it reacts to the environment
enough to forecast that out, and so far, that's been performing in line with that forecast and those
estimates. And importantly, we continue to stress it to make sure we're not missing anything and
importantly, we carry a sizable reserve, as you know, as part of that $20 billion.

your part of your CECL adjustment a little bit in your weightings, and you had previously talked about
getting towards normalized card losses, I think you'd said by around the end of the year. So can you just
given the changes that we're seeing ahead of us and definitely saw some normalization happen this quarter,

3%, and essentially, intra-quarter, particularly in March as I mentioned earlier, we did see a sizable increase
in flows. With that said, if you remember in the fourth quarter, we saw a nice run-up in deposits, and then
we have the seasonality point that I referenced in my prepared remarks where we have both operational
payments from our large TTS clients as well as tax payments with our TTS clients, also with Wealth clients

gain more deposits in the month of March, and was that in the US?",30,19,65,0.6,qa_session
Citigroup,First,MARK MASON,OTHER,"Yes, that's what I was talking about, Mike, in terms of those flows. They did come largely in
the US in the month of March, call it March 8th through kind of the end of March. They were overshadowed
by these normal payments that I referenced, and we did, we still see good activity kind of even as we came
through March and into early parts of April.",68,19,66,0.6,general_discussion
Citigroup,First,JANE FRASER,OTHER,And that was both in the Institutional business that we saw the inflows as well as in PBWM.,18,19,67,0.6,general_discussion
Citigroup,First,MIKE MAYO,OTHER,"And if you define deposits this way, I mean, if I'm oversimplifying, correct me, but, look, you
have 5,000 multinationals you really target for payments, Capital Markets and Banking. Those companies
have a lot of deposits, a lot of Services. That's the stickiness and that's where you said 80% of your clients
in TTS have been with you for over 15 years.
What if the deposits for those 5,000 multinationals, and I know I'm asking you to slice and dice in a little
bit different way, but even just a general sense, because the reason I'm asking this is because I think there's

Citigroup,First,MARK MASON,OTHER,"Yeah, thanks, Mike. Look, I'd tell you to turn to page 26 in the earnings presentation. We've
broken down the deposits for each of the businesses that we have, and at the bottom, you see the TTS
deposits, and this is where the 5,000 or so large multinational client deposits reside, and you can see the
stability, as well as the steady growth in those deposits over time. And to your point, these are largely
operational deposits that these clients have with us, and we shouldn't mistake rate sensitivity or betas with
stickiness, right, and it's because these deposits tend to be quite sticky with us, as you can see here.
Now, they're price-sensitive in the sense that as rates go up, we often have to reprice those. But remember,
the relationships we have with these clients are broader than just deposit relationships, and that's what
gives us the opportunity to adjust pricing accordingly with our deposits both in the US and outside of the
US. And so the other page, in your own time you can look at it is the page prior to that which again speaks
to the diversification of the portfolio but it also speaks to the length of time that many of these clients have
been with us and have grown with us, and so nearly 80% of our deposits are from clients that have a greater
than 15 year relationship with us, and that says a lot. And so anyway, those are the two points I'd make.
Hopefully that addresses your question around the stickiness.",261,20,69,0.6,opening_remarks
Citigroup,First,JANE FRASER,OTHER,"Yeah, I often say it takes a root canal to extract us from the operations of our clients just
because of exactly what we're talking about here, and that's also we see it even with the mid-market clients
that are a growing portion here as well because we're helping them expand internationally, and that
stickiness comes through and the LCR of 120% is a very high-quality LCR ratio.",68,20,70,0.6,general_discussion
