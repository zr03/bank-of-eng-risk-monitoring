The global economy continues to be remarkedly resilient, although the macro backdrop differs across key
markets. While the bulk of the tightening is behind us, central banks are responding vigorously to inflation
In the U.S., the tight labor market keeps pushing the timing of this elusive recession later into this year or
2024, with the robust demand for services providing a backstop for the economy.
The Eurozone has also exceeded expectations; however, most countries are facing pressure from labor and

term ROTCE target.
Today we reported net income of $2.9 billion and an EPS of $1.33. Our revenues ex-divestitures are

relatively flat to last year and we remain on track to meet our revenue guidance of $78-79 billion for the
year. We are also on track to meet the expense guidance for the year. And, consistent with the plan we
shared with you at our Investor Day, we are pursuing cost saving opportunities to help offset the significant
investments in our Transformation.
In Services, TTS continues to deliver, with revenues up a healthy 15%. This was driven by both net interest
income and non-interest revenue as we win fee-generating mandates with new clients and deepen our
relationships with existing large corporate and commercial clients. We are proud of our number one ranking
for large institutional clients1. And this week, we announced our latest innovation, Citi Direct Commercial
Banking, a digital platform to help our growing commercial clients tap into our global network.
Securities Services revenues were also up 15%, driven by higher interest rates across currencies. We are
really pleased with execution in this business as we continue to bring in new assets under custody and
administration, which are up by approximately $2.4 trillion in the last year. And we have gained 100 basis
points in share year-over-year as a result of the investments we have been making2.
Markets revenues were down 13%, compared to an exceptionally strong second quarter last year. From
early April, clients stood on the sidelines as the debt ceiling played out and we continued to experience very
low levels of volatility throughout the quarter. Despite this, our corporate client flows remained strong, and
we achieved our medium-term revenue-to-RWA target again this quarter.
In Banking, the momentum in investment grade debt has spread into other DCM products. But the long-
awaited rebound in Investment Banking has yet to materialize, and it was a disappointing quarter in terms
of both the wallet and our own performance with Investment Banking revenues down 24%. We continue
to right-size the business to the environment whilst making investments in selected areas such as
Technology and Healthcare.
In the U.S., taken together our cards businesses had double-digit revenue growth aided by customer
engagement and the continued normalization in payment rates. In Branded Cards, spend is still strong in
travel and entertainment, and acquisitions remain pretty healthy. This is a great franchise, and we have
launched a raft of new innovations from transforming our ThankYou rewards platform to our enhanced
value proposition for the premium card with our longtime partner, American Airlines.
Credit normalization is happening faster in Retail Services, given the p
say we are seeing a more cautious consumer but not necessarily a recessionary one.
Wealth revenues were down 5% as the business continues to be negatively impacted by the deposit mix
shift, particularly in the Private Bank, and by lower investment revenues. However, we have seen activity
pick up a bit in Asia for two quarters with growing net new assets. Referrals from the U.S. retail bank are
increasing, and globally, new client acquisition in the Private Bank and Wealth at Work has grown
significantly on the back of our investments in our network of client advisors and bankers.
Turning to expenses, they were elevated this quarter, as we expected. This includes the additional
repositioning actions we took to right size certain businesses and functions in light of the current
environment. Year-to-date, severance is about $450 million, including $200 million in the quarter.
Separate to repositioning, we remain committed to bending our expense curve by the end of 2024 through
three significant efforts.
First, we continue to make investments in our Transformation and other risk and control initiatives which
are necessary to modernize our infrastructure, automate our controls, as well as improve the client
experience. As we said before, we will start to see the more material benefits of these investments over the

Citi Second Quarter 2023 Earnings Review
July 14, 2023
On slide 4, we show financial results for the full firm. In the second quarter, we reported net income of
approximately $2.9 billion and an EPS of $1.33 and an RoTCE of 6.4% on $19.4 billion of revenues.
Embedded in these results are after-tax divestiture-related impacts of approximately $(92) million.
Excluding these items, EPS was $1.37 with an RoTCE of 6.6%. In the quarter, total revenues decreased by
1% both on a reported basis and excluding divestiture-related impacts, as strength across Services, U.S.
Personal Banking and revenue from the investment portfolio, was more than offset by declines in Markets,
Investment Banking and Wealth, as well as the revenue reduction from the closed exits and wind-downs.
Our results include expenses of $13.6 billion, up 9% both on a reported basis and excluding divesture-related
costs.
Cost of credit was approximately $1.8 billion, primarily driven by the continued normalization in Cards net
credit losses and ACL builds, largely related to growth in card balances.
Our effective tax rate this quarter was 27%, primarily driven by the geographic mix of our pre-tax earnings in
the quarter. Excluding current quarter divestiture-related impacts, our effective tax rate was 26%.
At the end of the quarter, we had over $20 billion in total reserves with a reserve-to-funded loans ratio of
approximately 2.7%. And through the first half of 2023, we reported an RoTCE of 8.7%.
On Slide 5, we show the quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year expense variance for the second quarter.
Expenses were up 9%, driven by a number of factors, including investments in risk and controls, business-
led and enterprise-led investments, volume growth and macro factors, including inflation, as well as
severance, and all of this was partially offset by productivity savings and expense reductions from the exits
and wind-downs
Severance in the quarter was approximately $200 million, and $450 million year-to-date, as we took further
actions across Investment Banking, Markets and the Functions.
We are investing in the execution of our Transformation and continue to see a shift in our investments from
third-party consulting to technology and full-time employees. And as we said last quarter, our
Transformation and technology investments span across the following themes: Platform and process
simplification, security and infrastructure modernization, client experience enhancements and data
improvements.
Despite the higher expense base sequentially, we remain in line with our full year guidance of roughly $54
billion, excluding divestiture-related impacts and the FDIC special assessment.
riances. In the
second quarter, net interest income increased by approximately $550 million, largely driven by dividends.
The increase in net interest income ex-Markets was largely driven by higher rates and cards growth, partially
offset by the mix shift that we have seen to higher rate deposit products within PBWM.
Average loans were flat as growth in PBWM was offset by the wind-down markets and a decline in ICG, as
we continue to optimize the loan portfolio including a further reduction in subscription credit facilities.
Average deposits were down 2%, largely driven by TTS as we saw some non-operational outflow as expected
in light of quantitative tightening. However, underlying this, we did see strong growth in operating accounts

as we continue to win new clients and deepen with existing ones. And our net interest margin increased 7
basis points.
On Slide 7, we show key consumer and corporate credit metrics. We are well reserved for the current
environment with over $20 billion of total reserves. Our reserves-to-funded loans ratio is approximately
2.7%. And within that, U.S. Cards is 7.9%.
In PBWM, 44% of our lending exposures are in US cards and of that exposure, 80% is to customers with
FICOs of 680 or higher. And NCL rates are still below pre-COVID levels and are normalizing in line with our
expectations. The remaining 56% of our PBWM lending exposure is largely in Wealth, predominantly in
mortgages and margin lending.
In our ICG portfolio, of our total exposure, approximately 85% is investment grade. Of the international
exposure, approximately 90% is investment grade or exposure to multinational clients or their subsidiaries.
And corporate non-accrual loans remain low at about 44 basis points of total loans.
As you can see on the page, we break out our Commercial Real Estate lending exposures across ICG and
PBWM which totals $66 billion, of which 90% is investment grade.
So, while the macro and geopolitical environment remains uncertain, we feel very good about our asset
quality, exposures and reserve levels and we continuously review and stress the portfolio under a range of
scenarios.
On Slide 8, we show our summary balance sheet and key capital and liquidity metrics. We maintain a very
strong $2.4 trillion balance sheet which is funded in part by a well-diversified $1.3 trillion deposit base across
regions, industries, customers and account types which is deployed into high-quality, diversified assets. Our
balance sheet reflects our strategy and well diversified business model. We leverage our unique assets and
capabilities to serve corporates, financial institutions, investors, and individuals with global needs.
The majority of our deposits, $818 billion, are institutional and operational in nature and span across 90
countries. These institutional deposits are complemented by $427 billion of US Retail consumer and global
wealth deposits as you can see on the bottom right side of the page.
We have approximately $584 billion of HQLA and approximately $661 billion of loans and we maintain total
liquidity resources of just under $1 trillion. Our LCR was relatively stable at 119% and our net stable funding
ratio was greater than 100%. We ended the quarter with a 13.3% CET1 ratio. And our tangible book value per
share was $85.34, up 6% from a year ago.
On Slide 9, we show a sequential CET1 walk to provide more detail on the drivers this quarter. Starting from
the end of the first quarter. First, we generated $2.6 billion of net income to common which added 22 basis
points. Second, we returned $2.0 billion in the form of common dividends and share repurchases, which
drove a reduction of about 18 basis points And finally, the remaining 14 basis point decrease was primarily
driven by RWA growth as we continued to grow card balances, partially offset by optimizing RWA in Markets
and Corporate Lending
We ended the quarter with a 13.3% CET1 capital ratio, which includes a 100 basis point internal management
buffer. We expect our regulatory capital requirement to be 12.3% in October of 2023, which incorporates the
increase in our Stress Capital Buffer from 4% to the preliminary SCB of 4.3% we announced a couple weeks
ago. And we will continue our dialogue with the Fed to better understand the differences between their
modeled results and ours, specifically in non-interest revenue.
That said, our strategy is designed to further diversify our business mix to have a more consistent,

predictable and repeatable revenue stream, as well as reduce risk and simplify our firm by exiting 14
international consumer markets. The strategy and the simplification coupled with the benefits of our
transformation investments will allow us to improve RWA and capital over time. The continued optimization
of our balance sheet should not only help SCB but reduce RWA. This will offset some of the anticipated
headwinds in capital requirements and RWA. And we will continue to reassess how and where we deploy
capital and evaluate the appropriate level of our management buffer over time.
On Slide 10, we show the results for our Institutional Clients Group for the second quarter.
Revenues were down 9% this quarter, as growth in Services was more than offset by Markets and Banking.
Expenses increased 13%, primarily driven by continued investments in TTS and risk and controls, as well as
approximately $120 million of severance in Investment Banking and Markets, partially offset by productivity
savings.
Cost of credit was $58 million, as net credit losses were partially offset by an ACL release. This resulted in
net income of approximately $2.2 billion, down 45%, primarily driven by lower revenues and higher
expenses. ICG delivered an RoTCE of 9.2% for the quarter and 11.4% through the first half of 2023.
Average loans were down 6% reflecting discipline around our strategy and returns. Average deposits were up
1% as we continued to acquire new clients and deepen relationships with existing ones.
On Slide 11, we show revenue performance by business and the key drivers we laid out at Investor Day. In
Treasury and Trade Solutions, revenues were up 15%, driven by 18% growth in net interest income and 8% in
non- -FX basis. We continue
to see healthy underlying drivers in TTS that indicate consistently strong client activity with, U.S. Dollar
Clearing Volumes up 6%, both in the quarter and through the first half of 2023, Cross-border flows up 11%,
outpacing global GDP growth, both in the quarter and through the first half of 2023, and commercial card
volumes up roughly 15%, led by spend in travel In fact, similar to the last few quarters, client wins are up
approximately 41% across all client segments. These include marquee transactions where we are serving as
In Securities Services, revenues were also up 15%, driven by higher net interest income across currencies. We
are pleased with the progress in Securities Services as we continue to onboard assets under custody and
administration, which are up approximately 11% or $2.4 trillion dollars And we feel very good about the
pipeline of new deals in Securities Services As a reminder, the Services businesses are central to our strategy
and are two of our higher-returning businesses with strong synergies across the firm.
Markets revenues were down 13%, driven by both Fixed Income and Equities, relative to an exceptional
quarter last year coupled with low volatility this quarter. Fixed Income revenues were down 13%, as strength
in our Rates franchise was more than offset by a decline in Currencies and Commodities. Equities revenues
were down 10%, primarily reflecting a decline in Equity Derivatives. But consistent with our strategy, we
continued to grow Prime balances, driven by client wins. Corporate client flows remained strong and stable
and we continued to make solid progress on our revenue-to-RWA target And finally, Banking revenues,
excluding gains and losses on loan hedges, were down 22%, driven by Investment Banking, as heightened
macro uncertainty continued to impact client activity, as well as lower revenues in Corporate Lending. While
we continue to have a strong pipeline and are seeing green shoots of activity, we recognize there is more work
to do in ECM and M&A. That said, we believe the investments we have made in Healthcare and Technology
coverage will benefit us over time.
So overall, while the market environment remains challenging and there is more work to be done, we are
making progress against our strategy in ICG.
Now turning to Slide 12, we show the results for our Personal Banking & Wealth Management business.

Revenues were up 6%, driven by net interest income growth of 7%, partially offset by a 6% decline in non-
interest revenue, driven by lower investment product revenues in Wealth. Expenses were up 5%,
predominantly driven by risk and control investments.
Cost of credit was $1.6 billion, driven by higher net credit losses as we continue to see normalization in our
card portfolios and a reserve build of $335 million, primarily driven by card balance growth.
Average loans increased 7% driven by cards, mortgages and installment lending. Average deposits
decreased 1%, largely reflecting our Wealth clients putting cash to work in fixed income investments on our
platform. And PBWM delivered an RoTCE of 5.5%, both for this quarter and through the first half of 2023,
largely reflecting the challenging environment for Wealth and higher credit costs.
On Slide 13, we show PBWM revenues by product as well as key business drivers and metrics. Branded Cards
revenues were up 8%, primarily driven by higher net interest income. We continue to see strong underlying
drivers with new account acquisitions up 6%, card spend volumes up 4% and average loans up 14%. Retail
Services revenues were up 27%, driven by higher net interest income and lower partner payments. For both
Card portfolios, we continue to see payment rates decline, and that combined with the investments we have
been making contributed to growth in interest-earning balances of 17% in Branded Cards and 12% in Retail
Services.
Retail Banking revenues decreased 9%, reflecting the transfer of relationships and the associated deposits
to our Wealth business. In fact, consistent with our strategy, we continued to leverage our retail network to
drive 25,000 Wealth referrals year-to-date through May, up 18% YoY.
Wealth revenues were down 5%, driven by continued investment fee headwinds and higher deposit costs,
particularly in the Private Bank. However, Wealth at Work revenues were up over 30%, driven by strong
lending results, primarily in mortgages. Client advisors were down 1%, reflecting the re-pacing of strategic
hiring. And new client acquisitions were up nearly 40% in the Private Bank and approximately 60% in

driven by closed consumer exits and wind-downs. Excluding divestiture-related impacts, expenses

maintaining our full-year
revenue guidance of $78 - $79 billion, excluding 2023 divestiture-related impacts, although the mix has
shifted somewhat. We are increasing our net interest income guidance from $45 billion to slightly above $46
billion for the full year excluding Markets, offset by lower non-interest revenue, largely driven by Investment
Banking and Wealth.
We are also maintaining our expense guidance of roughly $54 billion, excluding 2023 divestiture-related
impacts and the FDIC special assessment. Net credit losses in Cards should continue to normalize in the
remainder of the year, with both portfolios reaching normalized levels by year-end. And we now expect the
full-year tax rate to be approximately 25%, excluding discrete items and divestiture-related impacts.
As it relates to the third quarter, we expect continued momentum with clients, including fees, and benefits

Citigroup,Second,"QUESTION AND ANSWER
OPERATOR",MODERATOR,Our first question will come from Glenn Schorr with Evercore.,10,8,10,0.6,qa_session
Citigroup,Second,GLENN SCHORR,OTHER,"So, I'm very curious on the whole revenue to RWA topic, especially with some of the
changes coming in. So maybe you could give a little more color on -- let's take, for instance, the further
reduction in subscription credit facilities. I think I read somewhere that was like an $80 billion book down to
$20 billion. You can correct that if that's wrong. But just usually, those things are big important clients that
have relationship lending, things attached to them. So, I'm curious on how you balance the capital benefit,
the clear capital benefit, versus client impact and how you think about that? Are there other blocks of
business that are in motion right now?",116,8,11,0.6,financial_results
Citigroup,Second,MARK MASON,OTHER,"Thanks Glenn and good morning, and thanks for the question. Look, a couple of points on
that. One is we've been very focused on the revenue to RWA metric in our Markets business in the ICG more
broadly as well. And we've made considerable progress on that. And that's important because how we use
the balance sheet and ensuring that we're optimizing the use of the balance sheet contributes to how we
improve returns over time.
You're right to point out the subscription facility, credit facility, lending that we do. We brought that down
pretty significantly. The numbers you highlight are a lot higher than the portfolio. But what's important here
is that as we look at that, we look at a couple of things. So, one, the nature of relationship and whether clients
are taking advantage of the breadth of what we have to offer. Two, the profitability and returns associated
with the product to the extent that it is in a broader relationship, and where those returns are low, subpar,
and the prospect for doing more has proven to be fruitless, we take it down. And that's what we've done with
a large part of that book, just as we juxtapose it against other opportunities to use balance sheet where
clients are taking advantage of the broader franchise and therefore, are generating higher returns.
And we're going to continue to do that. We've done that to drive the revenue to RWA metric. We've done it
selectively on pieces of the portfolio like SCF. We've also looked at our broader corporate lending portfolio
and where those promises for higher relationship returns aren't manifesting themselves, we've not renewed
those loans. And as we think about pending regulatory changes, proactively making these efforts becomes
critically important. When I look back on the activity that we've done over the past couple of years, we've
reduced RWA by approximately $120 billion over the last 2 years, and about 75% of that is predominantly
driven by balance sheet optimization and looking at client activity that has low margin business. And so, this
is important for us to do and to keep doing.",358,8,12,0.6,opening_remarks
Citigroup,Second,GLENN SCHORR,OTHER,"I appreciate that, Mark. Maybe just a quick follow-up. On NII, I asked this last quarter too.
And your first half annualized ex-Markets is running about $1.5 billion ahead of the guide. Is that just
Copyright © 2023 Citigroup Inc. 8",41,8,13,0.6,qa_session
Citigroup,Second,MARK MASON,OTHER,"Thanks, Glenn. We did take guidance up to slightly above $46 billion from the $45 billion. I
guess there are a couple of things ex-Markets, of course. There are a couple of things to think
about in terms of headwinds and tailwinds that play through there. One is you've heard me mention before
that we've reached terminal betas in the U.S. Two, deposit volumes and the shift mix as we see consumers
kind of move into higher-returning type, higher-yielding type products. And three, really the wind-downs
and the exits and the reduction that they will play out in terms of NII. So those are kind of 3 headwinds as we
think about the forecast and the balance of year. There are obviously some potential tailwinds that play to
the other side, including rate movements in non-U.S. dollar as well as Card volume growth. And as we look
at those headwinds and tailwinds, our current read is to take it up, but $46 billion or slightly above that feels
like the right level in the context of total revenues at $78 billion to $79 billion.",184,9,14,0.6,opening_remarks
Citigroup,Second,OPERATOR,MODERATOR,And our next question comes from Jim Mitchell with Seaport Global Securities.,12,9,15,0.6,qa_session
Citigroup,Second,JIM MITCHELL,OTHER,"Maybe just getting on the expense side. You're keeping Mexico until 2025 now at the earliest.
So that will be on the books longer. How do we think about that bend the curve discussion? And maybe
specifically, you can help us think about bending the curve for the non-legacy businesses. Do we start to see
is the fourth quarter just a slowing or quarterly decline? Is it a year-over-year kind of a discussion? I just want
to make sure I understand the whole bend the curve notion and how to think about that.",93,9,16,0.6,general_discussion
Citigroup,Second,MARK MASON,OTHER,"Thank you. Let me take that. I'd say a couple of things. So, one, I'd reiterate the expense
guidance that we've given for the full year. So that's the roughly $54 billion ex-divestitures, or the impact of
divestitures, ex-any impact from FDIC special assessment. Two, as we think about bending the curve, I look
into 2024 and we're looking to bring the absolute expense dollars down from Q3 to Q4. So that bending of
the curve will occur. It will occur despite having Mexico still part of the franchise. And obviously still having
Mexico impacts the magnitude of the bend, but it will bend Q3 to Q4.
And then beyond that and through the medium term, we will see the curve continue to bend. Again, Mexico
impacts the magnitude of the bend, but we're very, very focused on bringing our costs down and bending
that curve. And you've heard us reference the aspects or the elements of our business that help contribute
to that, not the least of which are the exits, one of which is Mexico, and you referenced the timing there, but
also the benefits from investments that we've been making in transformation and risk controls and shifting
from manual processes to technology-enabled ones.
And then the final one is around simplifying our organization. And you heard in Jane's prepared remarks, as
we continue to make progress on these exits, it opens up the opportunity for us to lean more heavily into that
simplification. So, we are focused on not only the guidance, but the bending of the curve as you point out
and looking forward to delivering that and taking actions to ensure we do.",278,9,17,0.6,opening_remarks
Citigroup,Second,JIM MITCHELL,OTHER,"So just as a follow-up, is the way to think about sort of 2025 and beyond as you get through
a lot the automation on the sort of the non-legacy businesses and start to get much more efficient there. Is
there an absolute expense decline story in the core business? Or is that more that you need the top line
growth to get the improved returns?",66,9,18,0.6,general_discussion
Citigroup,Second,MARK MASON,OTHER,"Again, it's going to be a combination of continuing to bend the curve and bring our expenses
down. Obviously, we've given you guidance on operating efficiency of less than 60%, which will be some of
that top line growth, but it's the combination of the two.",46,9,19,0.6,guidance
Citigroup,Second,OPERATOR,MODERATOR,"And our next question comes from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.
Copyright © 2023 Citigroup Inc. 9",17,9,20,0.6,qa_session
Citigroup,Second,BETSY GRASECK,OTHER,"I just wanted to confirm on the CET1. You know you have the 100-basis point buffer on
top of regulatory minimums. So that would suggest that the 13.3% that you got this quarter is in-line with
where you're planning on holding it going forward, is that fair?",47,10,21,0.6,general_discussion
Citigroup,Second,MARK MASON,OTHER,"So, you're right, we hit 13.3% this quarter, down a tad bit from the 13.4% last quarter.
Effective October 1, the 4.3% SCB comes into play. And so that would equate to, assuming the 100-basis
point management buffer, a 12.3% regulatory requirement and a 13.3% kind of target that we would manage
to.
I'd highlight a couple of things that I'm sure are obvious to you, Betsy. One is this is the stress capital buffer
for the 12-month period starting October 1. And two is the strategy that we've described and talked about
and have started to execute against is intentionally designed to help morph the business towards a more
steady, predictable, consistent stream of revenues, fee revenue growth as well bring our expenses down over
time, and exit these markets, and those things should contribute to reducing our stress capital buffer over
time and improving our returns. But the answer to your question very directly is, yes, the 13.3% would reflect
where we'd be targeting as of October 1 for now.",172,10,22,0.6,financial_results
Citigroup,Second,BETSY GRASECK,OTHER,"And since you mentioned you're evaluating buybacks quarter-by-quarter. I guess the
question here is, how should I think about that relative to, we get Basel endgame coming out soon because
clearly, when youre at 13.3% against the new reg cap SCB, you know it signals a bigger opportunity for
buybacks over the coming quarters. So how should I think about that?",61,10,23,0.6,qa_session
Citigroup,Second,JANE FRASER,OTHER,"I think that consistent with what we've been talking about, there's a lot of uncertainty out
there about the new capital requirements, both in terms of the nature of them and the timing of
implementation. I think the industry is expecting to get more clarity about that with the comment period that
will be coming up.
Plus, it's a fairly uncertain macroeconomic environment at the moment, so both Mark and I feel it's prudent
to continue making that assessment until some of this uncertainty is clarified as to what precisely do.
You should take confidence that we're at the levels, including the management buffer that we expect to be
for the rest of the year. We've proven a good case of being able to build capital that's for sure over the last 2
years. And you take comfort as well we increased the dividend, we had $2 billion of capital returned last
quarter, so our intentions are clear to return capital where we can, but also to be prudent in how we do so,
given environment and current regulatory uncertainty.",180,10,24,0.6,guidance
Citigroup,Second,OPERATOR,MODERATOR,Our next question comes from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo.,10,10,25,0.6,qa_session
Citigroup,Second,MIKE MAYO,OTHER,"One negative question, one positive question. So, on the negative side, you talked about
bending the cost curve, but I think second quarter year-over-year, it's bending the wrong way, and 6 quarters
from now, you're saying it should bend the other way. So, what are we not seeing in the financials that gives
you such confidence? Because it seems, based on this quarter's results, a little bit more of a trust me story.
And on the positive side, TTS, continued double-digit growth, you continue to invest more in that business,
how are you monetizing greater money in motion among your multinational and other clients?",104,10,26,0.6,qa_session
Citigroup,Second,JANE FRASER,OTHER,"Thanks Mike, I'll kick it off and then send it back to Mark. In terms of the expense side, I think
we've been very transparent about the arc of our investment spend related both to the transformation and
beyond. We'll continue to give you that transparency, Mike. Note last year, we hit our expense guidance. This
year, we're on track for the guidance of roughly the $54 billion, ex-FDIC and divestitures and looking forward,
we continue to guide what are the 3 levers that will drive the reduction in the expense curve starting at the
end of '24. It's from exits and I think you've got a clear sense around the progress that we have been making
on the divestitures.

Citigroup,Second,MARK MASON,OTHER,"n the expense side, and then you may want to touch on the TTS, but
the only add on the expense side is, we are taking repositioning charges, Mike. I mean we're not sitting still
as we go through this uncertain period of time where wallets across certain parts of the industry are under
significant pressure. And in taking those repositioning charges, there are going to be expense reductions that
ultimately play out over the next 12-month period. So that's the other factor in addition to what Jane
mentioned in the way of exits and benefits from the transformation that will play into the cost base over the
next 12 months.",111,11,28,0.6,general_discussion
Citigroup,Second,JANE FRASER,OTHER,"And then on TTS, I think we all share your enthusiasm for this business in terms of the growth
potential that we've been realizing and expect to continue, albeit converging now to the medium-term
guidance over the next few quarters where we see it's a high to medium single-digit growth going forward.
It's a very high-returning business and some of the indicators of how we're monetizing those relationships.
We're seeing it both in terms of new client wins, they were up 41% this quarter. We have a sustained win-loss
ratio of 80% on the new deals across different client segments. We're also seeing growth that's starting to
really kick in from our commercial bank and the expansion of clients in the middle market around the world
as we grow out that franchise.
And we've got some very good fee-growth, which as Mark points out, and I point out all the time, we're very
focused around, so cross-border up 11% U.S. dollar clearing up 6%, commercial cards up 15%, etc.. And we
continue to invest in the business as well, so to make sure that 80%-win ratio continues. So, first bank to
launch 24/7, 365 dollar clearing, U.S. dollar clearing. We've got the instant payments platform we just
launched for e-commerce clients. We have Payments Express that is now live in the U.S., on track for 5
markets by the year-end. So, it's a story of innovation investment, it's got great returns. It's a
good growth story, and it just, it keeps on going.
And I don't want to diminish Securities Services in there either. It's another business that's, similarly,
continuing to see significant client wins, up 65% versus last year as well. And a lot of our strategy there has
been focused on gaining share with the asset managers in North America. Couple of years ago, we're down
at 2.6% share. We're up about 4.3%. Our target is about 5.5% there in 2025 in that key growth area. I know
there's a lot to like here too.",337,11,29,0.6,guidance
Citigroup,Second,OPERATOR,MODERATOR,And our next question comes from Erika Najarian with UBS.,10,11,30,0.6,qa_session
Citigroup,Second,ERIKA NAJARIAN,OTHER,"So, I apologize having to ask the expense question again, but I think it's just very
important because there's really two potential long-only investment thesis on Citi, right? One is the buyback
given your tangible book values at $85 and the and the stock at $46 other is the spending the curve on
expenses. So let me just ask Jim's question another way. In looking back to 2017, and I'm just looking at 2017
because I can break out legacy and core that way. And fast forward to 2022, you produced revenues ex
Legacy Franchises about $61 billion in 2017 and about $67 billion in 2022. The associated expenses, again,
without Legacy Franchises was about $34.5 billion in billion in 2017 versus $43.5 billion 2022, so you're
surpassing the revenue uplift during that period by $3 billion.
I guess the question is, you have so much certainty about the timing of this expense and I'm wondering how
much of this $9 billion can go away? We understand that there's a lot of opportunity for reinvestment in the
Copyright © 2023 Citigroup Inc. 11",183,11,31,0.6,financial_results
Citigroup,Second,MARK MASON,OTHER,"Yes, sure. Look, no need to apologize for asking the question again, it's an important topic.
I'd say a couple of things. So, one is that we can certainly look back in time, but I would highlight that we're
here because we needed to have invested more in our franchise. And so undoubtedly, there's going to be an
increase in our expense base that reflects the underinvestment from the past and in shoring up safety and
soundness and actually moving towards a more automated operational, more modernized operations and
infrastructure. So, there's certainly going to be that.
With that said, with those investments come efficiencies. So, with the move from manual to automation over
time, those types of investments will yield benefits in our cost structure. And that's part of what is going to
bend the curve over that medium-term period. The other thing that I'd highlight is, obviously, with the Legacy
Franchises, there's $7 billion of expense associated with those, and that will come down. But because of the
Mexico transaction, we're going to be stuck with that a little bit longer given the IPO process. It doesn't put a
big dent in our ability to bring stranded costs down and by the way, it does come with top line revenues and
historically has been accretive to our profitability and returns.
And so, I'm not going to give you kind of new guidance on where our expenses will end up. But what I will
point you to is not only the $54 billion this year, roughly $54 billion this year, not only the bending of the
curve in the third and fourth quarter or the third to the fourth quarter next year. But we've given guidance on
top line growth, revenue of 5% call it CAGR through that medium-term period, and we've given you kind of
operating efficiency targets that we've said as well, and we intend to deliver on those things that reflect the
bending of that curve through all of those drivers that we've mentioned.
So, I hope that helps, Erika. I appreciate the focus on both capital and expenses. We are equally focused on
it and know just how important it is to achieving those targets. We're not only kind of doing the things that
we've highlighted in that strategy articulation, but we're also being responsive to the current environment
that we're in. We think that aids in our ability to deliver the targets and the bending of the curve, and we know
there's an additional opportunity that Jane has referenced to the simplification of the organization as we
make -- what I would argue is considerable progress on the exits towards the end of this year. And all of
those things will be important to ensuring we get to that lower cost base, which we will do.",472,12,32,0.6,financial_results
Citigroup,Second,JANE FRASER,OTHER,"And it's a laser micro focus from us to make sure that we have the plans in place and the
execution to be able to achieve it. This is something we're extremely hands-on around and making sure that,
going to get done on each of the different drivers that Mark talked about.",52,12,33,0.6,general_discussion
Citigroup,Second,ERIKA NAJARIAN,OTHER,"And just a follow-up on that. I guess, you guys have been you guys have been pretty clear
on the timing, and pretty clear on why the curve will bend. I guess I'm wondering, is it just a timing issue that
you're not giving us the sort of the dollar numbers that could go away from the transformation? Is it just a
timing issue? Or are you still at a point where you don't know how much of that you would need to reinvest
to arrive at that 5% revenue CAGR?",91,12,34,0.6,financial_results
Citigroup,Second,MARK MASON,OTHER,"Sorry, your question was around expenses or the revenue?",9,12,35,0.6,financial_results
Citigroup,Second,ERIKA NAJARIAN,OTHER,"Expenses. So, we get loud and clear why the curve will bend. We get loud and clear when
the curve will bend, right? And there's clearly just expenses there that are catch-up expenses that are
transformational expenses to everything that Jane talked about. And that message has been loud and clear.
And I'm wondering if you haven't told us what could come out of those expenses because it's just a timing
issue, it's July 14th versus 4Q'24? Or have you not yet made decisions in terms of how you may allocate those
expenses in terms of do you need some of those expenses that could come out to grow your revenue base to
Copyright © 2023 Citigroup Inc. 12",119,12,36,0.6,financial_results
Citigroup,Second,MARK MASON,OTHER,"Yes. So, I'd say a couple of things. So, one, Erika, is obviously, with that revenue CAGR will
be volume-related expenses that play out. But we're also focused, obviously, on the non-volume-related
expenses and not giving you a precise number because the magnitude of that bend, right, is a factor, right?
So obviously, Mexico, for example, as I mentioned earlier, impacts the magnitude of the bend, right? And
we're going to, and have, in fact, when you look at our expense base even for the quarter, we've spent money
in Mexico to drive that top line 22% revenue growth, 10% ex-FX.
And so, there are going to be nuances in the running of the business in a way that ensures we're maximizing
shareholder value that impacts the magnitude of the bending of that that expense curve. Investments that
I got to continue to make in in TTS order to maintain that #1 position and that that competitive advantage
we have. And so those things will impact that magnitude of the bend. We've been, I think, very transparent
as we get into each year, giving you concrete numbers. What I'm telling you is the curve will bend. And as we
get closer to 2024, we'll give you more direction on the magnitude for that year and beyond.",216,13,37,0.6,financial_results
Citigroup,Second,OPERATOR,MODERATOR,Our next question comes from Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research.,10,13,38,0.6,qa_session
Citigroup,Second,STEVEN CHUBAK,OTHER,"Wanted to ask a question on capital. Just given the recent increase in your SCB, I was
hoping to better understand why the 11.5% to 12% remains the appropriate long-term objective in your
mind? And as we prepare for Basel III endgame, think through the capital benefit from future asset sales, can
you speak to whether that will translate into operational risk capital relief specifically as it's less clear
whether those benefits will accrete even as those asset sales are consummated?",81,13,39,0.6,qa_session
Citigroup,Second,JANE FRASER,OTHER,"I'll kick it off, Mark, and then pass it to you. So we're confident we're going to meet 11% to 12%
RoTCE target over the medium term. The core drivers of how we get there remains unchanged.
One, it's the revenues that we expect to grow by 4% to 5% CAGR as we continue to execute on the strategy.
On expenses, it's the clear path to bend the curve by the end 2024, bringing those expenses down over the
medium term. And third and importantly, it's continuing to optimize our balance sheet, including improving
RWA and capital efficiency. And as we referenced earlier in the prepared remarks, different drivers in that,
that are helpful, exiting 14 international consumer markets, changing our business mix. And I'd also note that
the transformation has benefits not only for our efficiency, but it will also support RWA and capital
optimization.
That said, there's uncertainty around the future capital requirements in the industry and importantly, the
timing of their implementation. We like everyone again to have to work through those implications once we
know what they are. But as we said, keep in mind, we've got some other levers to pull over time, capital
allocation, DTA allocation and utilization, our G-SIB score and our management buffer of 100 basis points.
So that's where you hear the confidence from us around the path to executing and that remaining consistent.
But Mark, why don't I hand over to you just around consumer market sales and operational RWA relief.",251,13,40,0.6,financial_results
Citigroup,Second,MARK MASON,OTHER,"Sure. And again, I think that if you look at the transactions that we've closed to date, they've
generated or freed up about $4.6 billion of capital the two that remain to be closed and the balance of year
will generate another $1.2 billion or so. That will be important to our capital base. I think that we obviously
have to see the proposal as it comes out and the NPR. And we'll have a window to respond to that. We're
hopeful that the regulators hear our response and views on it as it comes out. There's clearly going to be
reference to increases in RWA and operational risk implications potentially as part of that. I do think that
exiting, without having seen the proposal, and without obviously knowing how those rules might evolve. I do
believe that the exiting of these 14 markets does play towards not only reducing our SCB in stress scenarios
or as it comes out of stress analysis and tests, but also should play through helping to reduce risk-weighted
assets and potentially operational risk as well. But we have to see what the proposal looks like and go

Citigroup,Second,JANE FRASER,OTHER,"And I feel compelled to jump in here as well because as the spring and the recent test results
showed the large U.S. banks are not only in a strong capital position, but we've been able to play an important
stabilizing role for the system as a whole. It's a role that we take very seriously. And we certainly hope that as
the details of the capital frameworks get unveiled, this is fully taken into consideration, including the impact
on U.S. competitiveness, and we need a level playing field with Europe, not a gold-plated one, and we share
the concern that higher capital levels will undoubtedly increase the cost of capital for medium- and smaller-
sized enterprises and consumers in particular and will drive more activity to non-regulated and lesser
capitalized players that isn't in the system's interest. And we hope that that's fully taken into consideration
here because we will take actions on businesses, and we will take pricing actions as will the entire industry.",166,14,42,0.6,risk_discussion

fee income trends, given the lower partner payments, I mean clearly the Wealth fee trends would suggest
that they were quite subdued in the quarter. And I just wanted to understand your outlook over the near
medium term what drove some of the weakness this quarter? Is it something that you expect will likely
persist, especially given some of the market tailwinds that we've been seeing, would have expected to see a
little bit more resiliency in Wealth fee income in particular.",97,14,43,0.6,opening_remarks
Citigroup,Second,MARK MASON,OTHER,"Yes. Look, I think as we mentioned, Wealth was down about 5%. It's really hard to talk the
rebound in Wealth in the midst of such an uncertain environment and the one that we're in, it's hard to
disconnect those macro factors like rates, inflation, the prospect of a recession from what we're seeing in
Wealth. And I think there are two dynamics that have played out. One has been the shift from our customers,
from customers more broadly into higher-yielding products from out of deposits. And the other has been the
fee revenue from an investment management fee point of view, and as you might think about it, it is a higher
rate environment. There are opportunities for clients to earn more. And not until there's greater certainty in
the broader macro factors will I think we start to see some real momentum tick up there.
Now with that said, and a couple of things worth reiterating, which is we're seeing very strong referral
momentum from the Retail Banking business up through wealth continuum, if you will. So, we've had about
25,000 referrals May year-to-date from our retail branches into our broader Wealth business, that's a good
thing. We've seen the number of clients that we've onboarded tick up pretty meaningfully, both in the Private
Bank and more broadly across Wealth. That's a good thing. Those are things that that position us well for
when greater certainty does play out and these clients start to put monies back to work in the broader
investment platform and offering that we have.",261,14,44,0.6,financial_results

some metrics. One, remind us of what you reserved for in terms of unemployment rate, macro, and if we do
see a worsening in the markets, does that necessarily mean that we'll see big ratcheting up of credit reserves
from where you already are? Just some color around that would be helpful.",66,14,46,0.6,qa_session

Citigroup,Second,EBRAHIM POONAWALA,OTHER,"Yes. So, one, like where are you in terms of your unemployment rate assumption?
And if the unemployment outlook worsens, let's say, over the next 6 to 12 months, does that mean that you
Copyright © 2023 Citigroup Inc. 14",40,14,48,0.6,guidance
Citigroup,Second,MARK MASON,OTHER,"Got it. Thank you. Look, our current reserves, as you know, as we think about CECL, we've
got 3 different scenarios, we've got a base case in upside, a downside. Our current reserves are based on the
mix of those 3 macroeconomic scenarios. It reflects about a 5.1% unemployment rate on a weighted basis
over the 8 quarters, and it's roughly flat to what it was last quarter. What that means is, obviously, our
downside scenario has unemployment that's much higher than that, closer to 7% or call it 6.8% or so. But
that's kind of how we've thought about unemployment.
As we think about the reserves each quarter, obviously, we take a look at the macroeconomic factors and
how they're evolving. Our base case today assumes a mild recession and reserves in the future will consider
how are weighting towards downside, upside and baseline may morph subject to our outlook and volumes.
Those are the 2 factors that influence whether we're increasing reserves or not.
I would point out though that in addition to unemployment and because has been as stubborn as it has been,
if you will, we also look at debt service coverage ratio as an important factor as we think about our
consumers, as we think about their balance sheet, as we think about the risk that they may or may not be
facing. So unemployment is an important factor, but we've flexed our thinking in light of the environment
and in light of how behaviors have been shifting, and that's an important factor in how we think about our
reserves as well. I feel very good about the level of our reserves. You heard us mention earlier, we've got $20
billion of reserves, we're well reserved across the portfolio, but those are all important elements to it.",302,15,49,0.6,opening_remarks
Citigroup,Second,EBRAHIM POONAWALA,OTHER,"That's helpful. And just one very simplistic question. When you talk to some of your
largest shareholders, those who are optimistic think you can hit your RoTCE target medium term by 2025. Is
that a realistic expectation given I appreciate Basel changes, you answered like 10 questions on expenses.
But should we expect the groundwork through '24 that we hit that medium-term target in w25 or just your
degree of confidence.",71,15,50,0.6,guidance
Citigroup,Second,MARK MASON,OTHER,"Yes. Again, the thing I'd point out and Jane, feel free to chime in here, is that what we talked
about was getting to our medium-term returns, 11% to 12% and the medium term is 25 to 26, right? So it's
not just 25, just to be clear. And we do continue to feel very confident around our ability to do that. You heard
us mention the levers that we think will contribute to that. Obviously, capital is important and how that
evolves, and we continue to kind of work to optimize the balance sheet while serving our clients effectively
and importantly, growing the strong businesses that we have that are high returning as well.",115,15,51,0.6,general_discussion
Citigroup,Second,OPERATOR,MODERATOR,"And our next question comes from Matt O'Connor from Deutsche Bank.
You have mentioned continued normalization of credit card in the back half of the year.
And just wondering, you've got the normalized loss rates on Slide 22. Are you still thinking you'll hit those, I
think, exiting this year or early next year. And then I think at one point, you said they might go a little bit above
that before they kind of come back to a normal level? And is that still the case?",87,15,52,0.6,qa_session
Citigroup,Second,MARK MASON,OTHER,"Thanks for the question. The answer is yes. We still expect for both portfolios to hit those
normal levels sometime at the end of the year, the normal level, as you pointed out, on the page for both
Branded as well as for Retail Services. We would expect, again, subject to how and when this mild recession
kind of plays out, we would expect that they would tick higher than that before getting back inside of that
range.
But again, all of this is tied into how we've calculated our reserves, the delinquencies that we're seeing, the
mix of the portfolio, which again skews towards your higher FICO scores and the customer behaviors that
we're seeing, which play through not only that cost of credit line, but also plays through the growth that we
referenced earlier in the top line. But short answer is yes, that's still our thinking.

Citigroup,Second,JANE FRASER,OTHER,"And as Mark said, I think we feel good about our positioning as a prime, but also a strong
credit proposition that we have. We're seeing stronger demand for the credit-led products such as value
cards, bulk on installment loans as well the service-led engagement for the more prime customers. And so
that's also going to be a valuable factor driving growth and profitability as well.
And then the follow-up, and this is not really Citi-specific, but for the card industry, a lot
of the banks that are in card. Everyone is talking about kind of getting to normalized levels, just call it in the
near term here next couple of quarters. And I guess, just thoughts on getting this normalized level of losses
when unemployment is all-time low, wages are growing. Obviously, there's inflationary pressures, but it's
just a little surprising, again, not to Citi-specific, but it's a little surprising that we're getting to this normalized
state when things seem like they're pretty good.",165,16,54,0.6,financial_results
Citigroup,Second,JANE FRASER,OTHER,"Yes, I think well, also normalized state back in 2019 was also pretty good. So, you're not
hearing any alarm bells ringing from Mark or myself at all here on the U.S. consumer, I think we see the U.S.
consumer as resilient, we've talked about them being cautious but they're not recessionary. And we are
seeing more pressure on the lower FICOs. We don't have a large number of that in our portfolio, but that is
where we're seeing more of the normalization happening on the payment rates, for example, and other
behaviors in there. So, it's quite localized, but I don't think we should be overly concerned here about the
health of the U.S. consumer.
And as Mark said, we're in a very unusual environment. Higher inflation, these rate levels and a strong labor
market. And under those conditions, it's the debt service ratio, as he said, that is, we think, is a more useful
leading indicator that we keep a close eye on.",165,16,55,0.6,risk_discussion

Citigroup,Second,GERARD CASSIDY,OTHER,"Mark, can you share with us, in your financial supplement, obviously, you give us good
details on your credit picture and we're talking about credit right now. The nonaccrual loans have been flat
as a pancake for the last 12 months for you folks and the industry as well. And this is in light of the Fed funds
rates, as we all know, have been up over 500 basis points. Can you guys share with us why we haven't seen
more, this is mostly corporate of course, but everybody has been hanging in there very well in view of the fact
that rates have gone up so much. What are your customers telling you or are you seeing that has enabled
them to remain very healthy in light of a 500-basis point increase in interest rates?",136,16,58,0.6,general_discussion
Citigroup,Second,MARK MASON,OTHER,"I think I'd point to a couple of things, Gerard. One is, remember, we focus on the large
multinational, largely investment-grade quality names. And so that's one important factor when you think
about our ICG and corporate exposure there. The second thing I'd point out is we have to remember that
many of these companies had and still have very strong balance sheets and that they've managed that
through the COVID and pandemic situation and that has positioned them well.
I think the third thing is that and you've heard us mention how we're proactively managing the prospect of a
recession. And I think when I talk to other CFOs, I know that when Jane talks to other CEOs, they too are
looking at their expense line. They too are looking at the efficiency of their organizations and opportunity to
increase that efficiency in light of a potential slowdown or recessionary environment. And then the final point
is, I think a lot of firms have been that were proactive in the low-rate environment, in shoring up that balance
sheet strength.
Now with that said, you've heard us also mention the prospect of a rebound in capital market activities, and
that has to happen at some point. But sticking to your point around credit, I really think it's those factors that
you see play through in not only our very low NAL, but also our very low credit losses, credit cost that you've

over the last 12 months, banks like your own have positioned the balance sheet accordingly and I know the
Bank Analysts Association of Boston, Michael [Verdeschi] did a good job explaining how you guys manage
the balance sheet. And when you look at it going forward, do you think changes are coming because the Fed
if they end in Fed funds rate increase as we get to a terminal rate, how are you guys positioned the balance
sheet, do you think going forward?",99,17,60,0.6,general_discussion

needs, but also how we see the broader macro environment evolving and changing. And as you know, and I
know you've seen and we've talked about before, we share in our Qs, our view on our estimate for interest
rate exposure and what happens with 100 basis points swing in rates in one direction or another across the
curve across currencies. You've seen that shift over the last number of quarters to last quarter where that
estimate for IRE was about $1.7 billion or so, but heavily skewed towards non-U.S. dollar rates and
currencies.
And I think as we think about the view on how rates will evolve, you'll see a continued shift there. I think that
that when we look to print this quarter, number will probably come down a bit in terms of interest rate
exposure and skew even more towards non-U.S. dollar currencies in light of where rates are in those markets
and the U.S. dollar will likely be somewhat neutral in light of that curve currently looks like. But again,
something we actively manage, first with an eye towards what client demand and needs are likely to be for

we clearly have work that we're doing as it relates to the exits, but making very good progress on that, not
just on the closing of the exits but also on putting a dent in the stranded costs associated with those exits
that we have closed.
And so, as Jane mentioned in her prepared remarks, by the time we get to end of the year, ex-Mexico, we
would have made a considerable amount of progress on there, and that creates an opportunity to do more
around the simplification of the organization and so that simplification is obviously in an earlier inning, call
it, the exits in a later inning.
I think that the transformation spend investments and those things, look we are squarely into execution, as
you've heard us mention before. And as I've mentioned, the expense base around that is going to continue to
morph from spend that we've made around third-party consultants and that helped in the crafting of the
plan towards technology, towards people that are critically involved in the execution of it and then a
downward trajectory towards the benefits we get from that technology and reduced operational expense.
And so, it's a multi-year journey, we've talked about that. We've got a number of years to continue to execute
against it. But what's important is we know what we have to do, both in how we're investing that money and
as it relates to being disciplined about our cost structure and bending the curve. And again, that's what we're
going to do.

Citigroup,Second,MIKE MAYO,OTHER,"And one more attempt, can you remind us how many people are working on the transformation
remediation and how much that's costing you?",23,18,65,0.6,general_discussion
Citigroup,Second,MARK MASON,OTHER,"Yes think the number I shared was somewhere around 13,000 people or
so that are broadly working on the efforts here. We haven't gotten into specific costs; you know it's in the
total number. But what I would say again is that we're clear on what we've got to deliver and execute against
and we're managing that cost very tightly. We're constantly looking at opportunities to deliver on those
transformation deliverables, more efficiently, leveraging technology, leveraging AI in some instances. And so
we're not just taking those execution plans as they were crafted and delivering against them. But we're
looking for efficiencies and even the execution plans as they're constructed today. And that's important for
us to keep doing.",119,18,66,0.6,general_discussion
Citigroup,Second,OPERATOR,MODERATOR,And our next question comes from Ken Usdin with Jefferies.,10,18,67,0.6,qa_session
Citigroup,Second,KEN USDIN,OTHER,"I know this is going long here. Just a quick one, just, Mark, just wanted to get your sense on the
sentiment around client activity in both the Markets group and what the pipelines are looking like in
Investment Banking and the feel for that? Thanks.",46,18,68,0.6,opening_remarks
Citigroup,Second,JANE FRASER,OTHER,"Look, I'll jump in here. Corporates are pretty cautious. They've got another Fed hike in the
offing, tensions in China and the West, OPEC and all, and a general sense of more limited growth. But I think
clients have been trying to understand and get their arms around both the macro and the market outlook for
a while. I think they now seem to accept the current environment is new normal and are beginning to position
themselves globally.
So globally, we're seeing less anxiety around funding as most large corps are biting the bullet and paying
higher rates to take advantage of issuance windows, balance sheet is getting reinforced, we certainly don't
see a large cap credit prices on the horizon. And on the IB side, it remains, the pipeline is robust. There's a lot
of pent-up demand for M&A but it's hard to predict when that pipeline will unlock. ECM had tangible
momentum over Q1, and we're also seeing sponsor lev fin showing signs of improvement, but both of those
are from a very, very low base.
And on the investor side, most of the investors stayed on the sidelines in Q2. The debt ceiling was a bigger
topic than economic news was, and then it was a very low vol environment. We saw a bit of a pickup at the
beginning with the light bump in volatility in the last few days, but I wouldn't call that a trend yet.",242,18,69,0.6,guidance
Citigroup,Second,OPERATOR,MODERATOR,And our next question comes from Charles Peabody with Portales.,10,18,70,0.6,qa_session
Citigroup,Second,CHARLES PEABODY,OTHER,"A question about your Markets related net interest income. And before I ask the
question, I do appreciate that you run those businesses on a holistic basis and that NII is probably more of a
residual outcome. But a couple of questions related to Markets-related NII. First is, you had a pretty nice
jump up in the second quarter versus the first quarter. And I just wanted to understand, is that largely related
to seasonal dividend issues?
And then secondly, you have a positive NII outcome, where a lot of your money center in brethren will have a
negative NII outcome for Markets and I was just wondering what the difference is? Is it the outsized FICC
business relative to Equities? Or is it the international? Or is it how you hedge? What's the difference on that?
So those are the 2 questions.",143,18,71,0.6,financial_results
Citigroup,Second,MARK MASON,OTHER,"Thanks for the question, and thanks for the acknowledgment that we do manage our
Markets revenues in total, so I appreciate that. What I would say in terms of the Markets NII is, you've
captured it right, which is the dynamic that's playing out between first quarter and second quarter is, in fact,
dividend season. And again, given the globality of our franchise, the dividend is not just a dividend in any one
Copyright © 2023 Citigroup Inc. 18",79,18,72,0.6,opening_remarks
Citigroup,Second,CHARLES PEABODY,OTHER,"Okay. And just as a follow-up, is there any sort of directional guidance you can give on
Markets related to NII? I mean does it mean to the extent second quarter was bolstered by dividend, it comes
down in the third quarter, but then does it go back up in the fourth quarter? So would the second half be kind
of equivalent to the first half?",66,19,73,0.6,guidance
Citigroup,Second,MARK MASON,OTHER,"Charles, I really appreciate the attempt there. But I'm not going to give any further guidance
on the breakout of the NII, I will reiterate the ex-Markets NII increase, by the way, to plus $46 billion but
thanks for question. I appreciate that.",43,19,74,0.6,opening_remarks
Citigroup,Second,OPERATOR,MODERATOR,And our next question comes from Vivek Juneja with JP Morgan.,11,19,75,0.6,qa_session
Citigroup,Second,VIVEK JUNEJA,OTHER,"Couple of questions. Number one, so capital, Jane and Mark, going back to that, should we
expect that given what you've mentioned, given everything going on in the regulatory environment, ratio
you're at currently, it should grow in anticipation of what may come or likely to come with all the regulatory
stuff? Or are you going to try and keep that closer to the 13.3%?",65,19,76,0.6,guidance
Citigroup,Second,JANE FRASER,OTHER,"I think we're going to see exactly what the framework is that comes out and then the
implementation time frame for it and then look at making adjustments to plan, also hoping that the
comment period is taken seriously and the different considerations I talked about earlier are taken into
effect. Then we'll work through what are adjustments we make, pricing capital reallocation, etc., the
playbook that you would expect the same one that we've done with",77,19,77,0.6,guidance
Citigroup,Second,SA,OTHER,"The only thing I'd add is again, the CET1 ratio of the 13.3% as of October 1, would be a 12.3%
reg
of October 1. As Jane mentioned, the NPR as it comes out, we'll take a look at that and see if there are
implications on the CET1 stack, but more likely implications on the risk-weighted assets, right? And what's
really important there aside from the very important points Jane made in terms of considering broader
factors is the timing of the implementation of whatever that final rule includes and obviously, the more
timing for implementation, the more of an ability it gets for the industry to think about how to absorb the
implications there.",116,19,78,0.8,risk_discussion
Citigroup,Second,VIVEK JUNEJA,OTHER,"But I'm presuming you want to go sooner rather than later because the market is going to
expect that rather than take a full 3 years or whatever the Fed might give you.",33,19,79,0.6,guidance
Citigroup,Second,MARK MASON,OTHER,"You know what, I'm really interested at this point in seeing the proposal, and then we'll have
a chance to kind of, to really react as an industry and as a firm.",32,19,80,0.6,general_discussion
Citigroup,Second,VIVEK JUNEJA,OTHER,"Completely unrelated, if I may. Noninterest-bearing deposits, what are you seeing given
you're very heavily corporate driven. When I look at your point-to-point because you don't give a full average
balance sheet, it's only interest-bearing related. But the noninterest-bearing is only available on a period
end. If I look at that, there was a big drop in the U.S. this quarter. Anything unusual? Is that accelerating?
What are you seeing amongst your clients, people still waking up? And what have you factored into your NII
Copyright © 2023 Citigroup Inc. 19",91,19,81,0.6,general_discussion
Citigroup,Second,MARK MASON,OTHER,"Well, again, I think the point I'd make here is that we continue to see clients shift from kind
of noninterest-bearing deposits and into both interest-bearing and CDs and other higher-yielding products
in light of the rate environment that we're in. And I would expect us to continue to see those types of shifts
subject to how rates continue to evolve. And again, on the corporate side, we've seen in the U.S. clients have
reached kind of those terminal, that terminal level, terminal betas, I should say, outside of the U.S. rate hikes,
I think, are still in the future, as Jane alluded to, and the terminal betas have not quite yet been reached. But
in terms of the noninterest-bearing, we are seeing that dynamic play out.",127,20,82,0.6,guidance
