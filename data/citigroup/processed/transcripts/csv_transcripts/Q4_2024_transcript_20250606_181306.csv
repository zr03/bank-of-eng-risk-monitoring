Citigroup,Fourth Quarter 2024,JENNIFER LANDIS,OTHER,"Thank you, operator. Good morning and thank you all for joining our fourth quarter
2024 earnings call. I am joined today by our Chief Executive Officer, Jane Fraser, and our Chief Financial
Officer, Mark Mason.
I'd like to remind you that today's presentation, which is available for download on our website,
citigroup.com, may contain forward-looking statements which are based on management's current
expectations and are subject to uncertainty and changes in circumstances. Actual results may differ
materially from these statements due to a variety of factors, including those described in our earnings
materials as well as in our SEC filings.
And with that, I'll turn it over to Jane.",109,1,2,0.6,opening_remarks
Citigroup,Fourth Quarter 2024,JANE FRASER,OTHER,"Thank you, Jenn, and a very good morning to everyone. I am going to start with the macro
backdrop, and then walk you through our results for the full year. I will share some thoughts on the progress
we are making executing our strategy and then conclude with why we have decided to adjust our 2026
return target.
We entered 2025 with strategic clarity and good momentum across all our businesses. From the global
macro perspective, economies have done a good job tolerating hikes from central banks, and inflation has
clearly been receding. While policies will certainly impact economic activity, whether in the form of tariffs or
taxes, 2025 doesn’t look that different from 2024.
The U.S. remains at the heart of the macro picture. Growth is not only being driven by the higher end
consumer, but also by a strong, innovative corporate sector. China’s growth has been slower than expected
but there is still the prospect of further stimulus. Europe continues to underachieve. And many emerging
markets have re-emerged as bright spots, a trend which certainly benefits us given our global network and
deep presence in countries such as India and throughout the Middle East and ASEAN. I told you 2024 was a
critical year and I am proud of what we accomplished and how our businesses performed. We finished with
a very strong fourth quarter, which Mark will detail shortly.
For the full year, our net income was up nearly 40% to $12.7 billion. We exceeded our full-year revenue target
with revenues up 5% ex-divestitures. Fee revenue was up 17% and we saw a smaller impact from Argentina’s
currency devaluation. We delivered expenses within our guidance and improved our efficiency ratio by 340
bps whilst increasing investment in our Transformation. Our RoTCE grew over 200 bps, albeit from a low
level. Our five core businesses each generated positive operating leverage for the full year, which we also
achieved at the firm level.

Citi Fourth Quarter 2024 Earnings Call
January 15, 2025
Services was up 9% and had another record year, despite the lower rate environment, as a result of new
mandates and our emphasis on fee growth. We grew share in both TTS and Securities Services.
Capped by our best fourth quarter in a decade, Markets was up 6%. The performance of this franchise in a
low-volatility year shows the benefits of our diversified product mix.
Equities was strong throughout and was up 26% in what was a record year for us.
Banking was up 32% as we gained share across all three investment banking products. And we announced
an innovative $25 billion private credit partnership with our longtime client Apollo. Under Vis’ leadership, we
expect to continue to gain on our competition in 2025 and beyond.
2024 was the turning point for Wealth, as we sharpened our focus on investments, right-sized the expense
base, and improved the client experience. Revenue was up 7% for the year, including fee growth of 18%.
Citigold and Asia were particularly strong and Net New Investment Asset flows grew a very pleasing 40%.
We attracted top talent throughout the year in Wealth, most recently bringing in Kate Moore as our CIO and
Anne McCosker as our Head of Lending. This business has tremendous potential with both new and existing
clients, and we are really leaning into it.
USPB revenues were up 6% driven by borrowing across both card portfolios and by fee growth. We
announced a 10-year extension of our co-branded partnership with American Airlines, ensuring that this
valuable relationship enters into its fifth decade. With the acquisition of the Barclays portfolio, we will
become American Airlines’ exclusive partner in 2026 and we expect to deliver more value for our cardholders
and higher returns for our shareholders as a result.
We grew our Tangible Book Value per share by 4% and ended 2024 with a CET1 Ratio of 13.6%, approximately
150 basis points above our regulatory capital requirement.
After repurchasing $1 billion in common shares during the fourth quarter, we returned almost $7 billion in
capital to our common shareholders in 2024. Given how committed we are to returning capital, I am
particularly pleased to announce that our Board authorized a $20 billion share repurchase program.
You can see the very tangible progress we are making in executing the strategy that we laid out at our Investor
Day three years ago. We have materially simplified our firm since then. We exited consumer businesses in
nine countries, and near completion of our wind-downs in three and are on track to exit the final two. This
includes Banamex, which we legally separated from our institutional business in December. We are now fully
focused on getting ready to IPO, with the timing heavily dependent on regulatory approvals and market
conditions of course.
To align our structure with our strategy, we went through a significant simplification of our organization,
removing management layers and the regional construct. This has accelerated decision making and made
us a better partner to our clients.
We have strengthened our culture by better aligning compensation with our shareholders’ interests,
enhancing our scorecards to ensure we are delivering for clients. We attracted top industry talent throughout
our organization and that includes new leaders around my table for Banking, Wealth and Technology. We
have raised the bar on what we demand from each other and what we expect to deliver to our clients.
We have continued to innovate to improve the client experience and our efficiency. We are now live with Citi
Payments Express in 18 countries, and have converted four million retail bank customers to our Simplified
Banking platform in the U.S. We accelerated our use of AI, arming 30,000 developers with tools to write
code and launched two AI platforms to make 143,000 colleagues more efficient.
The investments we’re making to modernize our infrastructure, streamline processes and automate controls
are changing how we run the bank. We consolidated our balance sheet reporting to one unified ledger. We
implemented a cloud-based solution for risk analytics to better value trading assets. We have closed out
three long-standing consent orders. Our capital, liquidity and reserves are robust. Our focused strategy,
simpler structure and targeted client selection have all reduced our risk profile significantly.

Citigroup,Fourth Quarter 2024,MARK MASON,OTHER,"Thanks, Jane and good morning, everyone. I am going to start with the fourth quarter and
full-year financial results, focusing on year-over-year comparisons unless I indicate otherwise. I’ll also focus
on our current expectations for 2025 and 2026.
On slide 7, we show financial results for the full firm, which reflect improved performance both in the quarter
and the year. As a reminder, in the fourth quarter of last year, revenues were significantly impacted by
Argentina currency devaluation. Adjusted revenues and non-interest revenues for the full firm and Services
are shown in the appendix of the earnings presentation on slide 36. This quarter we reported net income of
$2.9 billion, EPS of $1.34 and an RoTCE of 6.1% on $19.6 billion of revenues, generating positive operating
leverage for the firm and in each of our businesses. Total revenues were up 12%, driven by growth in each of
our businesses and a smaller impact of Argentina currency devaluation. Net interest income excluding
Markets was roughly flat, with growth in USPB and Wealth offset by declines in Corporate/Other and
Banking. Non-interest revenue excluding Markets was up 40%, driven by continued strong fee momentum
across Services, Banking and Wealth along with lower partner payments in USPB as well as a smaller impact
of Argentina currency devaluation. And total Markets revenues were up 36%. Expenses were $13.2 billion,
down 18%, largely driven by the absence of the FDIC special assessment and restructuring charge in the prior
year. Excluding the impact of the FDIC special assessment and divestiture-related impacts, expenses were
down 7%, driven by the absence of the restructuring charge in the prior year and savings associated with our
organizational simplification, partially offset by higher volume related expenses. Cost of credit was $2.6
billion, largely consisting of cards’ net credit losses and ACL build. At the end of the quarter, we had over $22
billion in total reserves with a reserve-to-funded loans ratio of 2.7%. And on a full-year basis, we delivered
$12.7 billion of net income with an RoTCE of 7.0%.
On slide 8, we show full year revenue trends by business from 2021 to 2024. This year, we delivered $81.1
billion of revenue, up 5% on an ex-divestiture basis, driven by growth in each of our businesses and a smaller
impact of Argentina currency devaluation. Services revenues increased 9% to $19.6 billion, benefiting from
a smaller impact of Argentina currency devaluation, fee growth and higher deposit volumes. Markets
revenues increased 6% to $19.8 billion, primarily driven by growth in Equities, which had its highest annual
revenue in a decade, and Spread Products. Banking revenues increased 32% to $6.2 billion, largely driven by
growth in Investment Banking, with fees up 42% as we gained approximately 50 basis points of share on an
increased wallet. Wealth revenues increased 7% to $7.5 billion, primarily driven by a 15% increase in non-
interest revenue as we continue to grow client investment assets. USPB revenues increased 6% to $20.4

Citi Fourth Quarter 2024 Earnings Call
January 15, 2025
billion, driven by growth in cards, as we continue to see strong customer engagement and an increase in
interest-earning balances, as well as lower partner payments. Overall, this year demonstrates another year
of performance consistent with our medium-term target of 4 to 5% annual growth and the value of our
diversified business model.
On slide 9, we show the full year expense trend from 2021 to 2024. Excluding the impact of the FDIC special
assessment, our full-year expenses were $53.8 billion, in line with our target. Expense reduction was driven
by savings related to our organizational simplification and stranded cost reduction, as well as lower
restructuring and repositioning charges. Organizational simplification, stranded cost reduction as well as
efforts to drive efficiencies across the businesses contributed to a net decline of roughly 10 thousand direct
staff. These savings were mostly offset by higher volume-related expenses as well as investments in the
Transformation and other risk and controls and the Civil Money Penalties. As you can see at the bottom of
the page, we spent $2.9 billion on Transformation this year, which includes investments in our
infrastructure, platforms, applications, and data. Transformation investments were up 1%, driven by an
increase in certain programs, including data, largely offset by a reduction in the Transformation Bonus
Award. And we spent $11.8 billion on technology, focused on digital innovation, new product development,
client experience and other areas such as cyber security.
Turning to slide 10, we provide details on our $2.4 trillion balance sheet, which decreased 3% sequentially,
largely driven by the impact of foreign exchange translation. In the fourth quarter, we deployed some of our
excess liquidity into loans, while maintaining a 116% LCR and $933 billion of available liquidity resources.
Our $1.3 trillion deposit base remains well-diversified across regions, industries, customers and account
types. We maintained strong capital, ending the year with a preliminary 13.6% CET1 Capital ratio,
approximately 150 basis points above our regulatory capital requirement of 12.1%. And for the year we
returned nearly $7 billion in the form of common dividends and repurchases to our shareholders. Turning to
the businesses on slide 11, we show the results for Services for the fourth quarter and full year. Services
revenues were up 15%, driven by a smaller impact of Argentina currency devaluation and reflecting continued
momentum across Securities Services and TTS, both of which gained share this year. NIR increased 61%,
driven by a smaller impact of Argentina currency devaluation, as well as continued strength in underlying fee
drivers such as USD Clearing, Commercial Card spend, Cross Border transactions, and assets under custody
and administration. NII was roughly flat, as the benefit of higher deposit volumes was offset by the impact
of lower interest rates in Argentina. Expenses increased 1%, driven by continued investment in technology
and platform modernization, partially offset by productivity savings. Cost of credit was $112 million with a
net ACL build of $84 million and net credit losses of $28 million. Average loans increased 5% primarily driven
by continued demand for export and agency finance as well as working capital loans. Average deposits
increased 4% as we continue to see growth in operating deposits. Services generated positive operating
leverage and delivered net income of $1.9 billion and $6.5 billion for the year. And continues to deliver a high
RoTCE, coming in at 29.9% and 26.0% for the year.
On slide 12, we show the results for Markets for the fourth quarter and full year. Markets saw its highest
fourth quarter revenue in a decade and increased 36% with broad based gains across all products. Fixed
Income revenues increased 37%, driven by Rates and Currencies, which were up 39%, and Spread Products
and Other Fixed Income, up 30%, both reflecting increased client activity. Rates and Currencies also
benefitted from a conducive trading environment, compared to a challenging prior year quarter. Spread
Products and Other Fixed Income was driven by Credit and Mortgage Trading as well as higher securitization
volumes. Equities revenues increased 34%, driven in part by strong execution of strategic client transactions
in Cash Equities. And momentum also continued in Prime, with balances up approximately 23%. Expenses
decreased 8%, primarily driven by lower legal expenses and productivity savings. Cost of credit was $134
million, driven by a net ACL build, primarily related to Spread Products. Average loans increased 6%, primarily
driven by asset-backed lending in Spread Products as well as margin loans in Equities. Average trading
account assets increased 15%, largely driven by client demand for US Treasuries and foreign government
securities. Markets generated another quarter of positive operating leverage and delivered net income of
$1.0 billion and $4.9 billion for the year. And delivered an RoTCE of 7.4% and 9.1% for the year.

Citigroup,Fourth Quarter 2024,JIM MITCHELL,OTHER,"Hey, good morning everyone. Just I think as Jane noted, it seems like a material driver of the
reduction in the RoTCE target in 2026 is expenses. I think you kind of backed off the lower end of that, given
higher investments in the Transformation but also talked about it being somewhat temporary. We
appreciate the below $53 billion for 2026, but how much more is there to go beyond that in terms of
Copyright © 2025 Citigroup Inc. 6",80,6,9,0.6,opening_remarks
Citigroup,Fourth Quarter 2024,JANE FRASER,OTHER,"Happy New Year, Jim. I know you want to talk about the guidance, so let me put it into context
here. Last year, you've heard me be very clear about our two priorities. First one is driving the business
performance and the second is executing the Transformation. You've seen this quarter, you've seen last
quarter, you've seen the full year our businesses are delivering the progress we wanted them to. The strategy
is working. We've changed the business mix. We're generating more fee-based revenues. You see that in
Services with NIR up 37% this year, Wealth NIR up 15%, IB fees up 35%, an important part of the mix around
the quality of our earnings.
We said Services as a crown jewel. It's delivered growth, high returns, it's taken share. It's a crown jewel. We
made a strategic play in Wealth, and you've seen us very steadily prove out why we can be a force globally
with a clear path to delivering the financial performance that we said we would do. We've consistently
delivered on our revenue and expense targets. And I see a lot more opportunity and more upside to
strengthen our business performance. We're very tangibly getting after it. We're pretty excited by it.
The second priority, Transformation. I've got to tell you, I'm broadly pleased with the progress we've made in
risk and compliance and accountability. Kind of excited by the work we've got going on in controls for the
business as well at the moment. We've been very transparent. Data is an area we have more work to do in.
We increased our investments last year, as you know. And then as part of the annual planning process, we
took a big step back to reassess our plan. And I decided, along with Mark and the management team, we
needed to expand the scope and accelerate some of the work to satisfy our regulators' expectations.
I'm confident that the decision to do that, it was the right one. It's the right one for our Transformation efforts,
it’s certainly the right one for the firm overall. I could have taken a short-term decision to cut other
investments that are important for our long-term competitiveness, I'm just not going to do that. You
shouldn't want me to do that. And as I said in the opening comments, this 2026 target is a waypoint, not the
final destination.",399,7,10,0.6,financial_results
Citigroup,Fourth Quarter 2024,MARK MASON,OTHER,"I just want to address the second part of your question, Jim, in terms of the path to the less
than 60%. I think Jane framed it out quite nicely in that we're building a franchise that will have continued
and sustainable top line revenue momentum. We are focused on driving out the inefficiencies and stranded
costs and Legacy Franchise expenses from the organization and the benefits from these investments we've
made in the Transformation will yield a lower cost structure over time as well. And so the combination of
those things will get us to that targeted operating efficiency as we come out of 2026 at less than 60%. So
yes, there is still a path, and we are focused on that path.",124,7,11,0.6,financial_results
Citigroup,Fourth Quarter 2024,JIM MITCHELL,OTHER,"Okay. Great. That's very helpful. And then just maybe pivoting to the buyback, great to see
the $20 billion authorization. Obviously, I can't help but ask about beyond 1Q. If we do sort of get this more
certainty maybe no increase in capital requirements, does that start to help you maybe at least temporarily
lower the buffer to take advantage of, you’re trading below tangible book and getting the accretion and
accelerating the buyback? Or how do you think about the rest of the year on the buybacks?",88,7,12,0.6,qa_session
Citigroup,Fourth Quarter 2024,MARK MASON,OTHER,"Look, I'll make a couple of comments. So one, we're very pleased to have announced the
buyback program at $20 billion. I think, in many ways, that is a demonstration, if you will, of continued
confidence in the earnings generation and momentum that we have around that as well as the recognition
that we are trading below book and not where we want to be. And you've heard both Jane and I speak to the
importance of increasing and doing more in the way of buybacks. We've increased that to $1.5 billion. I think
that supports that same degree of confidence that we have in the momentum. We are constantly looking at
every year on an annual basis as we go through our planning process at the management buffer that we have
of 100 basis points.
And despite the last couple of quarters at running above the 13.1%, our target is the 13.1%. And so as we go
through the balance of the year, as we get clarity on reg rules and what have you, you'll see us continue to
manage down to that 13.1% and obviously, the two important characteristics that we keep in mind is the

open, please go ahead.",21,8,14,0.6,qa_session
Citigroup,Fourth Quarter 2024,JOHN MCDONALD,OTHER,"Thank you. Mark, just wanted to follow up on your answer to Jim right there. So when
you look at the 10% to 11% RoTCE target for 2026. Is that kind of assuming you'll be around the target or like
using the 13.1% as the target? And then longer term, you hope to bring that target down as rules get clarified
and the franchise gets simplified?",66,8,15,0.6,opening_remarks
Citigroup,Fourth Quarter 2024,MARK MASON,OTHER,"Hey John, good to hear from you. In fact, yes, the 10% to 11% RoTCE target we've set for 2026
does assume that we are running and using a 13.1% CET1 ratio obviously, there'll be an SCB that comes out
sometime later this year. The rules are continuing to evolve and what have you, and we'll factor those in as
we know more about them. But yes, it does assume the 13.1% which is our management target, if you will, for
CET1.",82,8,16,0.6,general_discussion
Citigroup,Fourth Quarter 2024,JOHN MCDONALD,OTHER,"Okay. Great. And then my next question is, could you clarify what you're expecting this
year for card net charge-offs? Understand the quarterly cadence has seasonality. But for the full year, it
sounds like you're expecting the charge-offs to be in the range of last year's guidance. Can you just kind of
clarify that? And then maybe just talk about provision build, which you had a lot of in 2024 and whether that
could slow down as the maturation of balances slows down? Thank you.",85,8,17,0.6,opening_remarks
Citigroup,Fourth Quarter 2024,MARK MASON,OTHER,"Sure. So in terms of the net credit losses and the forecast that we have, we are expecting
that the net credit losses will be at the high end of the range that we've given. So in the case of Branded Cards,
that 3.5% to 4% is the full year range that we've given. In the case of Retail Services, it's 5.75% to 6.25%,
excuse me, and so right now, Retail Services is at that high end at 6.28% for 2024. We'd expect it to stay at
that high end, and then on Branded Cards, we're at 3.64%, we'd expect it to creep up to about the 4% level
over the course of the year. But remember, that is a full year NCL rate, and we know that there's seasonality
through the quarters. And so you'll see movement through the quarters based on that dynamic.
And then just in terms of the provision build, there are a couple of drivers there. One is obviously volume, and
we do expect to see volume growth in USPB. So that will be an important factor in how the CECL calculations
are done. And then the second driver is obviously, as you know, we run models and the models they have a
base scenario, they have a downside, an upside scenario depending on the broader macro factors,
unemployment, GDP, et cetera, et cetera, and our weighting towards the likelihood of high or upside or
downside scenario, those factors become important considerations in the provisioning. And so that's kind
of how we think about that going into 2025. I hope that helps.",267,8,18,0.6,guidance

Citigroup,Fourth Quarter 2024,MIKE MAYO,OTHER,"Hi, just a clarification. So you are guiding for three consecutive years of lower expenses
including that $600 million repositioning this year. So they were down in 2024, you're guiding them lower in
2025 and you guide them lower in 2026 again, and you're also guiding for three consecutive years of higher
revenues based on what you said. I didn't see that in the written materials, but I think I heard you say that,
Mark. So three years of lower expenses, three years of higher revenues to at least 2026. Is that correct?",93,8,20,0.6,financial_results
Citigroup,Fourth Quarter 2024,MARK MASON,OTHER,"Yes, that is correct. I think you described it correctly. We're seeing continued momentum on
the top line. and we're focused on continuing to bring our expenses down just as we did in 2024, a tad bit in
2025 and then more in 2026.",44,8,21,0.6,general_discussion
Citigroup,Fourth Quarter 2024,MIKE MAYO,OTHER,"All right. And then I guess this is for Jane. Well, that beats haggis on toast, if you achieve that.
But I'm wondering why that efficiency might not improve even more. I mean if you have $5 billion of stranded
costs and Transformation costs in 2024 and some of that goes down. I heard you're investing in tech and
Copyright © 2025 Citigroup Inc. 8",65,8,22,0.6,general_discussion
Citigroup,Fourth Quarter 2024,JANE FRASER,OTHER,"First of all, I'm a little disturbed by your comment about haggis on toast. It's haggis with
mashed potatoes and whiskey, just to be clear for everyone. It's Robert Burns night coming up soon. On
expenses, Mike and everyone, expenses are a focus not just for Mark and I, but for the entire management
team. We're making sure that focus and discipline is really getting installed and instilled into the DNA of Citi.
And you've seen that, as you referenced, we've been meeting our expense guidance over the last couple of
years, we've been driving positive operating efficiency.
We're all very focused on improving our operating expense base. Consolidating technology, the
simplification work, automation, getting different utilities put in place rather than fragmented around the
firm, using AI tools now our, location strategy, right? So that core operating expense base is something that
we're really looking at how do we drive to be more efficient, more modern and getting it to the level it should
be for the revenues that we generate. We all want Transformation to get done quickly, and we want it to get
done right. So that is why our expenses are temporarily elevated to make the investments that needed there.
This is not all run rate.
And as you say, as CEO, I will not sacrifice the right long-term investments in our growth and
competitiveness for short-term expediency. This is a way point. It's not a destination. And we know what we
need to do. We've got our arms around all of this, we're just getting on with execution.",263,9,23,0.6,financial_results

Citigroup,Fourth Quarter 2024,BETSY GRASECK,OTHER,"Hi good morning. Jane, just to follow up on what you mentioned, as you do execute, we all
expect, or at least I do, that the market will be giving you credit for that execution, and meaning multiples
should increase. I have a few questions here on the buyback, because right now, today, as we all know, you're
trading below book, it has got to be, buying back stock has got to be the most accretive use of capital today.
And why wait on the buyback when you can lean into it today and keep your 2026 guide, I mean, the old
guide was 11% to 12% RoTCE, new guide, 10% to 11%.
I'm kind of confused why you don't pull that lever more aggressively because buying back the stock, the
accretion to tangible book, it’s got to be the easiest thing to do to help that RoTCE go up. When you compare
and contrast against all the hard work you've been doing, which will obviously be very important to getting
the RoTCE up. But why not lean more into that buyback? And can you give us a sense of the timing of that
$20 billion? Thank you.",198,9,25,0.6,opening_remarks
Citigroup,Fourth Quarter 2024,JANE FRASER,OTHER,"Yes, Betsy, I love the passion. I've got to say I can hear the determination in your voice. I think
it's the same determination we feel. Look, we're very committed to returning capital shareholders period. Full
stop. We’ve got a $20 billion buyback program, as Mark said, that is reflective of the growing earnings power
that we have and our confidence in the path ahead. We've been increasing the amount of capital return over
the last few quarters. I'm also happy to see a more aggressive Basel III scenario firmly off the table.
We have, nonetheless, a 13.1% CET1 ratio that we put in the plan that can change over time as well. But there's
not, there's not complete certainty around where the capital requirements are going to go. We hope there
will be a holistic one that is reflective of the risk profile of the bank that's been improving significantly over
the last few years. So we have some great growth opportunities. I look at the different areas. I'm excited by
what we see in Wealth. We've got a great runway with our clients who want to do business with us in
Banking.
We've got some very important investments and an investment agenda that we're putting in to help us
continue growing the bank, gaining competitiveness in a responsible way. I'll just conclude with exactly your
point. The bar is high on those investments. We don't make them unless we see extremely attractive marginal
RoTCE. And there's a lot of things we say no to in order to put the $20 billion program in place. In terms of

2024 turning point for Wealth, and we've seen very steady progress on the RoTCE in Wealth. Just talk to us
in terms of, Andy Sieg’s being in the seat for a year now, you've seen progress. What needs to happen? Just
talk to us a little bit about the franchise positioning competitively both in the U.S. and abroad as you think
about going head-to-head with some of your global competitors and where are the most likely growth
opportunities over the next year or two?",102,10,28,0.6,general_discussion
Citigroup,Fourth Quarter 2024,JANE FRASER,OTHER,"Yes. So, our vision, my vision is that we become a global leader in wealth management. There
are not many firms that have the globality of Citi. We have all the assets, especially the client relationships
all around the world, which were just not tapped for investments in the past. It's a big opportunity. We have
$5.3 trillion “off us” from existing clients. And I think the fact that I would find interesting is 55% of it, it's
almost $3 trillion with affluent clients in our branch network in America, in the U.S.
We're also very well-positioned to capture new wealth, just think about what Citi does in terms of our
footprint, our capabilities really supports the wealth creation, from the Commercial Bank, our Investment
Banking side, Markets, obviously, Services supporting it, too. These are all great feeders for us to strengthen
wealth relationships with our clients.
So we brought in Andy. Andy greatly sharpened the focus on the investment business, this is where we see
the big upside. He's been building a differentiated value proposition around wealth creation. He’s been
leveraging a lot of the leading capital market capabilities, the different relationships we have with PE firms,
asset managers around the world. Get a great platform in place and importantly, improving our client
experience, again, particularly around investments, asset allocation, performance, et cetera. What I have
also got to love is the surgical approach that he's taking to the expense base and driving productivity,
something that we're doing across the firm. I'm also excited by the talent he's bringing, in the market leaders
like Kate Moore and Keith Glenfield in the investment space. And we've made a lot of investments in training
and building this investment culture that we didn't have before.
So to your point, the proof points are working. Q4 revenue up 20%, operating margin at 21% on its way to
25% to 30%, 10% RoTCE on its way to 15% to 20%. These last few quarters, you've just seen us on that march.
And the number I'm most excited by, net new investment asset inflow of $42 billion, up 40% year-over-year.
The strategy is working. We're going to be a leader in wealth, the growth opportunities, Asia U.S., Middle East,
all the places where we are with our existing clients and the new wealth generators of the future.",392,10,29,0.6,financial_results
Citigroup,Fourth Quarter 2024,EBRAHIM POONAWALA,OTHER,"And if I can draw a parallel to the Banking segment with the RoTCE is about 5% to
6% last few quarters. There you brought in Vis Raghavan from JPMorgan. Just give us a sense of could we see
a similar trajectory in that business over the next 12 months and where the opportunities are to improve that
ROE?",59,10,30,0.6,general_discussion
Citigroup,Fourth Quarter 2024,JANE FRASER,OTHER,"Yes. I think absolutely, a strong performance, the strategy we have in place is delivering nicely.
So if you look at the revenues, the investment banking fees, positive operating leverage all through the year
and gaining share. All three products gaining share in all three in all of the geographies we're in, I'm really
excited and happy to see the health care and technology, two areas that we've been investing heavily behind.
And you're also seeing us playing a leading role in some of the key transactions, the biggest transactions last
year. Mars Kellanova, single adviser, big role in Boeing, and then just this week, the J&J acquisition of
Intracellular. So the deals that matter, this is where you're seeing Citi playing a leading role in.
So when Vis joined, the mandate, a bit similar to Andy, becoming a top three investment bank, deliver the
full potential of One Citi to our clients. So we've got a lot of upside there, instilling some more discipline in
capital allocation, client coverage, some of the cross-firm linkages. We're getting a lot more from our people.
We've been bringing in some great new talent we've also been cutting some of the unproductive spend. So I

Citigroup,Fourth Quarter 2024,OPERATOR,MODERATOR,"Our next question comes from the line of Erika Najarian with UBS. Your line is now open, please
go ahead.",20,11,33,0.6,qa_session
Citigroup,Fourth Quarter 2024,ERIKA NAJARIAN,OTHER,"Thank you. Hate to ask the umpteenth question on the buyback, but clearly, the way the
stock is reacting today, the buyback is very important to your shareholders. I guess my first question, if I
could have the two questions, is it's very clear that you want to return capital to shareholders. It's very clear
that you have excess capital. It's very clear that your PPNR trajectory is positive. And so what are the specific
mile markers that that Citi needs to see in order to increase that pacing from that $1.5 billion a quarter to
something is more suggestive of a pace that that would be in line with that $20 billion authorization? And I
know that's been asked of you already, but is it the consent order? Is it the stress test? We had some news
over the holidays that were positive for the sector. Like what are those specific mile markers? I mean you're
doing it on the PPNR side, right? Like what do you need to see to have even more confidence, again, like
leaning into Betsy’s words, to go all in on the buyback?",189,11,34,0.6,opening_remarks
Citigroup,Fourth Quarter 2024,MARK MASON,OTHER,"Yes. So thank you for the question. Let me make clear a couple of things. So one, and I've
said this already, so I apologize for repeating myself, but one, our target for CET1 is 13.1%, and so what you're
going to see over the course of the year is us managing down to that target? That's kind of one point.
The second point I want to be clear is that it's not the consent order. That's not something that that is
impacting the capital actions and decisions that we take. We obviously forecast out the performance. As I've
said, Jane has said already, we see very strong continued earnings momentum, managing towards a 13.1%
CET1 ratio. And you'll see the buyback trajectory reflect getting down to that CET1.
The one thing I will mention, and you mentioned already is that we obviously have another CCAR process,
stress test that we will go through. And none of us can predict kind of what's on the other side of that from
an SCB point of view, but that will be an important factor as we get through the first half of the year and into
the second half of the year in terms of kind of the level of buybacks that we will be taking on a quarter-by-
quarter basis.
So I hope that helped. There are no artificial constraints, so to speak, that are in place. This is us planning
and forecasting the performance of the franchise ensuring they can fuel high-returning growth opportunities
so that we're building a sustainable franchise, looking at the capital requirements that we have and the
management buffer that we put in place and therefore, taking that excess capacity and putting it towards
buybacks, but with an eye towards the regulatory environment that we're in, and what I mean by that are the
capital requirements that come out of the annual stress testing process that's run. So that's the basics of it
as we sit here today.",332,11,35,0.6,opening_remarks
Citigroup,Fourth Quarter 2024,ERIKA NAJARIAN,OTHER,"Got it. And just my second question, as we think about 2026. And again, I don't want to
put words in your mouth because clearly, it's very critical in terms of your targets and hitting them. So you
targeted less than $53 billion. Is it fair to assume like Jim was asking that $51 billion to $53 billion is not the
target, but it's less than $53 billion? But to that end, I mean just taking a step back, I think, Jane, you said
something very important in that want to get to the returns in a sustainable way. And clearly, your
shareholders are scarred by previous management when the returns went up to double digits and went back
tumbling down and wasn't sustainable. And should we just really think of this as, look, like it takes a while to
turn around a money center bank and 2026 may have been the target in 2022, but we're going to get there
in 2027, 2028 anyway, and just doing this in a sustainable way, and we're not robbing the bank of
investments.
Copyright © 2025 Citigroup Inc. 11",187,11,36,0.6,qa_session
Citigroup,Fourth Quarter 2024,JANE FRASER,OTHER,"Erika, we chose the words very carefully to say that 2026 is a way point, it's not the
destination. And when I'm looking at it, I'm looking out to 2027, 2028, what is the bank we want to be in
terms of our strategy, our performance, our culture, all those different dimensions. And we just relentlessly
keep going down that path, but we're going to take the right and responsible decisions as we go down it. So
our potential is for more than our medium-term target RoTCE, the potential of the bank and the journey that
we're on is to improve our returns beyond there, for sure.
And then you asked a question about Banamex. So, on that front, look, we had a singular focus on the
separation of two banks, that was an enormous body of work because we had to put up Mexico's eighth
largest Bank de Novo in a very short period of time. It got done December 1, that was over 100 regulatory
approvals to get that done. Now we have turned our full attention to the IPO. We're getting ready to be able
to IPO as soon we can. But given market conditions and given regulatory approvals, it's possible this could
go into 2026, but we're doing everything in our control to be ready as soon as possible. We are not the right
owner of the bank. We are committed to the simplification of Citi. We will follow a responsible process here.",247,12,37,0.6,qa_session
Citigroup,Fourth Quarter 2024,MARK MASON,OTHER,"And just in terms of the impact and the timing that Jane referenced, just keep in in mind that
the financial impact of exiting Banamex comes two forms. One is the gain or loss on sale and two is the risk-
weighted asset release. The gain or loss on sale will run through the P&L at deconsolidation, so that's the
point where we've gotten, or we've",66,12,38,0.6,risk_discussion

Citigroup,Fourth Quarter 2024,GERARD CASSIDY,OTHER,"Okay, I got it. Our expense report on this end. Anyway, just following up, Mark, on your
comments about the IPO with Banamex. Can you guys remind us, or refresh our memories, on when the IPO
process starts, once it goes public, what percentage ownership do you guys expect to have? And second,
have you given us any color on whether you expect to report a gain on this transaction or a loss as you just
referenced, that will go through the P&L?",83,12,42,0.6,guidance
Citigroup,Fourth Quarter 2024,MARK MASON,OTHER,"We haven't given any sense for the exact timing of that. As you know, this is a process. And
so Jane just spoke to the timing of that process, the first step, having been completed on December 1 with
the separation, we are now obviously gearing up and readying ourselves for the IPO. There'll obviously be
important filings associated with that given our intent to dual list, there will be regulatory approvals that are
required kind of as we make headway with potential investors as part of the IPO process.
And so there are a series of IPO steps that we will need to take over the course of the year in order to continue
to ready ourselves and there are things that we don't control. Like as Jane mentioned, the regulatory approval
process and timing for that as well as the market conditions. And so all of those factors are important. And
then how the IPO occurs in terms of percentage that is taken on at that first tranche versus follow-on
tranches are important factors on when we get to deconsolidation. And so I haven't given you an exact timing
on that but you can envision kind of 15% tranches that happen over kind of a 12-, 18-month, 24-month
period. And then obviously reaching a point of deconsolidation at which point that currency translation
adjustment starts to flow through the P&L. There's no material impact on capital, but it does flow through
the P&L. And then ultimately, we exit 100% over the course of time.

Citigroup,Fourth Quarter 2024,GERARD CASSIDY,OTHER,"Well, I appreciate the insights. And then as a follow-up question, and I really don't mean
this as a ‘what have you done for me lately?’ type of question because you guys have made so much progress
in what you're doing in your strategic changes here. But can you talk about the U.S. Personal Banking, many
of your questions today is about the RoTCE consolidated and how you can improve that, and this business
has a very low RoTCE as you guys know, below your cost of capital. And structurally, when you look at it, if
you look at the loans at the end of period just over $220 billion, your deposits about $90 billion, which is
quite a bit different than your peers who have much higher ROEs. So how do you approach this business?
And again, I know you've been very busy divesting a lot of the businesses that are not important, but it seems
to me that this is a giant hurdle that you guys have to approach at some point in the near future.",178,13,44,0.6,qa_session
Citigroup,Fourth Quarter 2024,JANE FRASER,OTHER,"Let me just chat a bit through this. So what’s the path to the higher returns in U.S. Personal
Banking, it’s coming from top line revenue growth, improved expense base and also a lot more normalized
credit environment, and that gets us to the mid- to high-teen returns in the medium term. I think we feel very
confident and comfortable in that. You're seeing the proof points I talked about Banking, Wealth earlier,
we’ve had another good quarter of revenue growth, had the ninth consecutive quarter of positive operating
leverage. So I think you should be getting some comfort around that.
What's going to drive that growth? Co-brands, we just extended with American to be their sole issuer. It's
going to give exciting benefits to the American Airlines and the Citi cardholders. And it will be beneficial for
both our growth and our returns. In the proprietary front, we're investing. There's a lot of investment in
innovation to drive growth. The refreshed Strata Premier Card, we've been enhancing the reward offerings
and you're seeing us often now #1 in recognitions and awards around that area. Retail Services being
forensically focused on improving the partnership economics and driving top line growth. And then Retail
Banking, there we're driving primary checking growth, we’ve put in simplified banking, so we get a much more
streamlined customer proposition that's driving more of a relationship-based banking approach as opposed
to a transactional one.
Importantly as well, the Retail Bank has been feeding our Wealth business. I think you heard me earlier
talking about that almost $3 trillion “off us” investment opportunity that we have from the retail banking
customer base. We transferred $17 billion of deposits from USPB to Wealth, so you've got to take that, those
dynamics into account. So I hope you're taking from me, I feel confident in our ability to get to the medium-
term targets we set for the business of mid- to high-teens. I feel comfortable about the growth trajectory
that we've got based off the innovations we're putting through and the changes. And good expense discipline
and a better credit environment. So when you look at the mix of our business, I think you'll see us performing
nicely here.",371,13,45,0.6,financial_results

Transformation investment spend. And sorry if I missed this, but did you talk about the pace of those two
levels in your 2025 and 2026 expense guidance? I know directionally, you said it's going up. But did you give
a magnitude?",58,13,47,0.6,guidance
Citigroup,Fourth Quarter 2024,MARK MASON,OTHER,"I did not. Obviously, for both technology and Transformation those are areas that we are
going to continue to invest in for all the reasons that we've mentioned. They obviously contribute to the
number in 2025 being slightly down from the $53.8 billion, but they also represent, as I mentioned, what we
believe is required to kind of get the work done that we need to get done. And so those numbers will increase.
There are lots of puts and takes, as you know, through an annual expense forecast, right, including, as you
would expect, we've got volume, we’ve got revenue growth here that's going to come with volume growth.

we need to be spending on. Through the annual planning process that that concluded last month, it was
clear we did need to invest more. We increased the scope of some of the work on the data front. We brought
some other work forward. We looked at what we needed to do on the technology front and some of the
critical investments. So this is pretty forensic and when we're looking at Transformation, we're looking at
technology, we know what our target states need to be, and we know what we need to do to get there and
the outcomes we need to be delivering.
So we've got our arms around this, and I think you're hearing that confidence from us around what we need
to do. We know the investments we need to make. You know what the outcomes and the benefits for
shareholders and the regulatory side need to be.",173,14,50,0.6,general_discussion

Citigroup,Fourth Quarter 2024,SAUL MARTINEZ,OTHER,"Mark, the NII ex-Markets outlook, if I just take the fourth quarter and annualize that, I get
to something in the neighborhood of, I think, around $47.4 billion, $47.5 billion which is above the full year
2024 level. I'm not sure exactly what “up modestly” means, if that's 1%, 3%, 4%, but, and correct me if you
think I’m wrong, but it seems like maybe there's a little bit of conservatism built in? If you can just comment
on how you think, and how we should think about the quarterly trajectory of NI ex-Markets? Obviously,
there's a day count issue in 1Q, but maybe how do you think through like, how we should expect that NII to
evolve over the course of the year?",124,14,52,0.6,guidance
Citigroup,Fourth Quarter 2024,MARK MASON,OTHER,"I mean, why don't I just kind of cut to the chase on it a little bit, Saul, in the sense that, “up
modestly”, call it a couple of percentage points, 2 to 3 percentage points or so, right, in terms of how I think
about it. And I think I've taken, I’ve gone through kind of the tailwinds and headwinds, so I won't kind of take
you through that again. But I think the important takeaway should be that we're going to see continued
momentum across the franchise driven by loan growth in the Branded Card side of the business and
continued deposit momentum, particularly operating deposits in Services. And we're going to do everything
that we always do around the management of pricing, and we'll get a benefit from how we've been managing
our investment portfolio as those things mature. The combination of those efforts will offset, more than
offset some of the headwinds that you'd expect in a declining rate environment, and modestly is, call it, 2%
to 3%.",172,14,53,0.6,guidance
Citigroup,Fourth Quarter 2024,SAUL MARTINEZ,OTHER,"Okay. Fair enough. And then on the expense outlook getting to below $53 billion in 2026,
I know that's consistent with what you've said in the past, does imply a pretty sharp reduction in 2026,
especially in light of continued revenue growth, it's pretty material operating leverage. Just I mean, how much
benefit do you get from a more normalized severance? In other words, how much are we thinking about
severance coming down? What's sort of the impact or how to think about the Legacy, stranded costs coming
down? Just maybe a little bit more meat on the bone in terms of how much these items will benefit 2026
versus 2025?",111,14,54,0.6,financial_results

running high, it was $700 million, we're forecasting $600 million in 2025. I think kind of normal through the
cycle is probably, call it, $300 million or so. And so that gives you some sense for that. I think the other thing

degree of hell to organize this way, get rid of your two intercompany holding companies, eliminate five layers
of management, expand span of control and you guys went through a lot last year. And I'm just wondering,

you see that continuing? But first, the concrete question about the targets, please.",112,15,57,0.6,qa_session
Citigroup,Fourth Quarter 2024,MARK MASON,OTHER,"So I guess I'll start first. So in terms of the targets, look, we set the targets across each of the
lines of business for the medium term. We've obviously brought down the 2026 to 10% to 11%. And so you'd
imagine there's some movement, at least for the 2026 in terms of those targets, Banking will likely be a little
bit lower than the mid-15%, if I think about 2026 as being that medium-term target date. But over time, I
expect that the targets that I've set are the targets that we will achieve and even more because, as Jane
mentioned, 10% to 11%, while that's our 2026 target, it is not our longer-term target as we think about RoTCE
and the strength of these businesses in the aggregate franchise. So hopefully, that answers your question.",137,15,58,0.6,guidance

lines of business are driving the business performance forward. The bank is simpler. There is tremendous
transparency for our investors as well as for me. There's much greater proximity to the businesses now. And
you can see that the benefits that we're starting to realize from the strategy as we get closer and closer to the
