Citigroup,First,JANE FRASER,OTHER,"Thank you, Jenn, and good morning to everyone. Today I am going to touch on the
macroeco
quarter.
While global economic performance was surprisingly desynchronized last year, the overall story has been
consistent of late: one of economic resiliency supported by tight labor markets and the consumer. Growth
this year looks poised to slow in many markets. And conditions are generally disinflationary - you are
already seeing some central banks in the emerging markets starting to cut rates.
In the U.S., a soft landing is viewed as increasingly likely. But we continue to see a tale of two Europes with
Germany hurt by the weak demand for goods while southern European countries such as Spain and Greece
benefit from stronger demand in services.
In Asia,
although its property market remains a concern.
Amidst all these dynamics, we continue to focus on executing against our strategy and delivering the best
of Citi to all our stakeholders. I said 2024 will be a pivotal year for us as we put our business and
organizational simplification largely behind us and we focus on two main priorities: the Transformation and
the performance of our businesses and the firm.

Citi First Quarter 2024 Earnings Call
April 12, 2024
Last month marked the end to the organizational simplification we announced in September. The result is
a cleaner, simpler management structure that fully aligns to and facilitates our strategy. We are now more
client-centric
clear lines of accountability, starting with my management team, fewer layers, increased spans of control,
and frankly much less bureaucracy and needless complexity.
This will all help us run the company more efficiently, it will enhance our client experience, and improve
more roles were ultimately impacted than the 5,000 we discussed in January.
We also took a number of other steps to sharpen our business focus and improve returns by right placing
strategy; and right sizing the workforce in Wealth.
As a result of all these combined steps, which include the simplification, we are eliminating approximately
7,000 positions which will generate $1.5 billion of annualized run-rate expense saves. The combination of
these actions and the measures we are taking to eliminate our remaining stranded costs will drive $2 to
$2.5 billion in cumulative annualized run-rate saves in the medium term.
We are keeping a close eye on the execution of these efforts and overall resourcing to ensure we safeguard
our commitment to the Transformation. As you know, given its magnitude and scale, the Transformation
is a multi-year effort to address issues that have spanned over two decades.
We have made steady progress as we retire multiple legacy platforms, streamline end-to-end processes,
and strengthen our risk and control environment. All of which are necessary, not only to meet the
expectations of our regulators, but also to serve our clients more effectively.
A transformation of this magnitude is never linear. So while we have made good progress in many areas,
there are a few where we are intensifying our efforts, such as automating certain regulatory processes and
the data related to regulatory reporting. We are committed to getting these right and will look to self-fund
the necessary investments to do so.
Turning to the quarter, we had a good start to a pivotal year. We reported net income of approximately $3.4
billion, EPS of $1.58 and an RoTCE of 7.6% on over $21 billion of revenues. Our revenues were up over 3%
year-over-year, excluding divestitures, which was primarily the billion-dollar gain from the India consumer
sale last year. Our expenses were slightly down quarter-over-quarter, excluding the FDIC special
assessments.
Services continues to perform well and generate very attractive returns. Revenue was up 8% for the quarter
as both businesses won new mandates and deepened relationships with existing clients.
Fees were up a pleasing 10% for Services year over year, driven by the investments we have made across
our product offering, platforms and client experience. In Securities Services, we took share again this
quarter. And in TTS, cross-border activity continued to outpace global GDP growth, and commercial card
spend remained robust. We look forward to diving deeper into these two businesses at our Investor
Presentation on Services in June.
impacted Rates and Currencies, that was off a very strong first quarter last year. We saw good client activity
in Equities and in Spread Products, where both new issuance and securitization activity were particularly
robust. We fully integrated our Financing and Securitization capabilities within our Markets business and
we started to see the benefits of having a unified spread product offering for our clients.

Citi First Quarter 2024 Earnings Call
April 12, 2024
On slide 6, we show financial results for the full firm. In the first quarter, we reported net income of
approximately $3.4 billion, EPS of $1.58 and an RoTCE of 7.6% on $21.1 billion of revenues. Total revenues
were down 2% on a reported basis. Excluding divestiture-related impacts, largely consisting of the $1 billion
gain from the sale of the India consumer business in the prior year, revenues were up more than 3%, driven
by growth across Banking, USPB and Services, partially offset by declines in Markets and Wealth. Expenses
were $14.2 billion, up 7%, on a reported basis. Excluding divestiture-related impacts and the incremental
FDIC special assessment, expenses were up 5%. Cost of credit was approximately $2.4 billion, primarily
driven by higher Card net credit losses, which were partially offset by ACL releases in Wealth, Banking and
Legacy Franchises. At the end of the quarter, we had nearly $22 billion in total reserves with a reserve-to-
funded loans ratio of approximately 2.8%.
On slide 7, we show the expense trend over the past five quarters. We reported expenses of $14.2 billion,
which included the incremental FDIC special assessment of roughly $250 million. Also included in this
number are $225 million of restructuring charges largely related to the organizational simplification. In total,
actions, we expect approximately $1.5 billion of annualized run-rate saves over the medium term related to
a headcount reduction of approximately 7,000. In addition to the restructuring, we took approximately $260
million of repositioning costs largely related to our efficiency efforts across the firm, including the reduction
of stranded costs associated with the consumer divestitures. The expected savings from these actions will
allow us to continue to fund additional investments in the Transformation this year. And relative to the prior
year, the remainder of the expense growth was largely driven by inflation and volume-related expenses,
partially offset by productivity savings. In the remainder of the year, we expect a more normalized level of
repositioning, which is already embedded in our guidance. Therefore, you can expect our quarterly expense
trend to go down from here in line with our $53.5-$53.8 billion ex-FDIC expense guidance.
On slide 8, we show net interest income, deposits, and loans, sequential variances. In the
first quarter, net interest income decreased by $317 million, largely driven by Markets, which resulted in a 4
basis point decrease in net interest margin. Excluding Markets, net interest income was relatively flat.
Average loans were up $4 billion, primarily driven by Loans in Spread Products in Markets, as well as Card
and Mortgage loans in US Personal Banking, partially offset by declines in Services. And average deposits
were up nearly $7 billion, primarily driven by Services, as we continue to grow high-quality operating
deposits.
On slide 9, we show key consumer and corporate credit metrics. This quarter, we adjusted our FICO
distribution to be more aligned with industry reporting practices and now show our FICO mix using a 660
threshold. Across Branded Cards and Retail Services, approximately 85% of our card loans are to consumers
with FICO scores of 660 or higher. And we remain well reserved with a reserve-to-funded loan ratio of 8.2%
for our total card portfolio. In our Corporate portfolio, the majority of our exposure is investment grade,
which is reflected in our low level of non-accrual loans at 0.5% of total corporate loans. As a reminder, our
loan loss reserves incorporate a scenario-weighted average unemployment rate of approximately 5%, which
includes a downside scenario unemployment rate of close to 7%. As such, we feel very comfortable with the
nearly $22 billion of reserves we have in the current environment.
highlight the strength of our balance sheet, capital and
liquidity. We maintain a very strong $2.4 trillion high-quality balance sheet, which increased 1% sequentially.
Despite this increase, we were able to decrease our risk-weighted assets reflecting our continued
optimization efforts and focus on capital efficiency. Our balance sheet is a reflection of our risk appetite,
strategy and diversified business model. The foundation of our funding is a $1.3 trillion deposit base, which
is well diversified across regions, industries, customers and account types. The majority of our deposits,
$812 billion, are corporate and span 90 countries. Most of our corporate deposits reside in operating
accounts that are crucial to how our clients fund their daily operations around the world. In most cases, we
integrated services payments & collections, liquidity management and working capital solutions. All of
which greatly increase the stickiness of these deposits. The majority of our remaining deposits, about $423

April 12, 2024
billion, are well diversified across the Private Bank, Citigold, Retail and Wealth at Work, as well as across
regions and products. Now turning to the asset side, over the last several years, we have maintained a strong
risk appetite framework and have been very deliberate about how we deploy our deposits and other liabilities
into high-quality assets. This starts with our $675 billion loan portfolio which is well diversified across
consumer and corporate loans. And the duration of the total portfolio is approximately 1.2 years. About one-
third of our balance sheet is held in cash and high-quality, short-duration investment securities that
contribute to our nearly $1 trillion of available liquidity resources. And for the quarter, we had an LCR of 117%.
So to wrap it up, we are active and deliberate in the management of our balance sheet, which is reflected in
our high-quality assets and strong capital and liquidity position.
On slide 11, we show the sequential CET1 walk to provide more detail on the drivers this quarter. First, we
generated $3.1 billion of net income to common shareholders, which added 27 basis points. Second, we
returned $1.5 billion in the form of common dividends and share repurchases, which drove a reduction of
about 13 basis points. Third, we saw an increase in our disallowed DTA, which resulted in a 10 basis point
decrease. And finally, the remaining 6 basis point benefit was largely driven by a reduction in RWA. We ended
the quarter with a preliminary 13.5% CET1 capital ratio, approximately 120 basis points, or over $13 billion,
above our regulatory capital requirement of 12.3%. That said, our capital requirement does not yet reflect our
simplification efforts, the benefits of our Transformation or the full execution of our strategy, all of which we
expect to bring down capital requirements over time.
So now turning to slide 12. Before I get into the businesses, let me remind you that in the fourth quarter, we
implemented a revenue sharing arrangement within Banking, and between Banking, Services and Markets
to reflect the benefit the businesses get from our relationship-based lending. The impact of revenue sharing
is in In Services, revenues were
up 8% this quarter, driven by continued momentum across both TTS and Securities Services. Net interest
income increased 6%, driven by higher deposit and trade loan spreads. Non-interest revenue increased 14%,
largely driven by continued strength across underlying fee drivers. In TTS, cross-border volumes increased
9%, USD clearing volumes increased 3% and commercial card spend volumes increased 5%, all of which was
driven by strong corporate client activity. In Securities Services, our preliminary assets under custody and
administration increased 11%, benefiting from higher market valuations, as well as new client onboarding.
The growth in both businesses is a direct result of our continued investments in product innovation, the
client experience and platform modernization to gain share across all client segments. TTS continues to
maintain its number one position with Large Corporate and FI clients and see good momentum in the
commercial client segment. And we continue to gain share in Securities Services. Expenses increased 11%,
largely driven by continued investments in technology and product innovation. Cost of credit was $64
million as net credit losses remain low. Net income was approximately $1.5 billion. Average loans were up
4%, primarily driven by strong demand for working capital loans in TTS. Average deposits were down 3% as
the impact of quantitative tightening more than offset new client acquisitions and deepening with existing
clients. However, it is worth noting that we continue to see good operating deposit inflow. And Services
continues to deliver a high RoTCE of 24.1% for the quarter.
On slide 13, we show the results for Markets for the first quarter. Markets revenues were down 7% as lower
Fixed Income revenues more than offset growth in Equities. Fixed Income revenues decreased 10%, driven
by Rates and Currencies, which were down 21%, on the back of lower volatility and a strong quarter in the
prior year. This was partially offset by strength in Spread Products and Other Fixed Income, which was up
26% driven by an increase in client activity, particularly in asset-backed lending. And we continued to see
good underlying momentum in Equities, with revenues up 5%, driven by growth across cash trading and
equity derivatives. And we continued to make progress in prime with balances up more than 10%. Expenses
increased 7%, largely driven by the absence of a legal reserve release last year. Cost of credit was $200
million, primarily driven by macroeconomic assumptions related to loans in Spread Products that impacted
reserves. Net income was approximately $1.4 billion. Average loans increased 8%, primarily driven by asset-
backed lending in Spread Products due to an improvement in market activity. Average trading assets
increased 4% sequentially, largely driven by seasonally stronger activity in the first quarter. Markets
delivered an RoTCE of 10.4% for the quarter.

April 12, 2024
On slide 14, we show the results for Banking for the first quarter. Banking revenues increased 49%, driven by
growth in Investment banking and Corporate Lending and lower losses on loan hedges. As I previously
mentioned, Corporate Lending results include the impact of revenue sharing from Investment Banking,
Services and Markets. Investment Banking revenues increased 35%, driven by DCM and ECM as improved
market sentiment led to an increase in issuance activity, particularly Investment Grade, which is running at
near-record levels. Advisory revenues declined given the low level of announced merger activity last year.
However, in the quarter we participated in the pickup in announced M&A across sectors, including those
Corporate Lending revenues, excluding
mark-to-market on loan hedges, increased 34%, largely driven by higher revenue share. We generated
positive operating leverage this quarter as expenses decreased 4%, driven by actions taken to right size the
expense base. Cost of credit was a benefit of $129 million, primarily driven by changes in portfolio
composition. The NCL rate was 0.3% of average loans, and we ended the quarter with a reserve-to-funded
loan ratio of 1.5%. Net income was approximately $536 million. Average loans decreased 6% as we
maintained strict discipline around capital efficiency, as we optimize Corporate loan balances. RoTCE was
9.9% for the quarter, reflecting a rebound in activity, reserve releases and continued expense discipline.
On slide 15, we show the results for Wealth for the first quarter. Wealth revenues decreased 4%, driven by a
13% decrease in NII from lower deposit spreads and higher mortgage funding costs, partially offset by higher
investment fee revenues. omentum in non-interest revenue, which was up 11%, as we
benefited from higher investment assets across regions, driven by increased client activity as well as market
valuations. Expenses were up 3%, driven by technology investments focused on risk and controls, as well as
platform enhancements, partially offset by the initial benefits of expense reductions as we continue to right
size the workforce. Cost of credit was a benefit of $170 million, driven by a reserve release of approximately
$200 million primarily related to a change in estimate as we enhanced our data related to margin lending
collateral. Net income was $150 million. End-of-period client balances increased 6%, driven by higher client
investment assets. Average loans were flat, as we continued to optimize capital usage. Average deposits
decreased 1%, largely reflecting lower deposits in the Private Bank and Wealth at Work and the continued
shift of deposits to higher-
relationships and the associated deposits from USPB. Client investment assets were up 12%, driven by net
new investment asset flows and the benefit of higher market valuations. RoTCE was 4.6% for the quarter.
foundational priorities. As Jane mentioned, this will take time but over the medium to longer-term, we view
this as a greater- than-20% return business.
On slide 16, we show the results for US Personal Banking for the first quarter. US Personal Banking revenues
increased 10%, driven by NII growth of 8% and lower partner payments. Branded Cards revenues increased
7%, driven by interest-earning balance growth of 10% as payment rates continue to moderate. And we
continue to see healthy growth in spend volumes up 4%, primarily driven by our more affluent customers.
Retail Services revenues increased 18%, primarily driven by lower partner payments due to higher net credit
losses, as well as interest-earning balance growth of 9%. Retail Banking revenues increased 1%, driven by
higher deposit spreads, loan growth and improved mortgage margins. Expenses were roughly flat due to
lower compensation costs, including repositioning, offset by higher volume-related expenses. Cost of credit
of approximately $2.2 billion increased 34%, largely driven by higher NCLs of $1.9 billion as card loan
vintages that were originated over the last few years were delayed in their maturation due to the
unprecedented levels of government stimulus during the pandemic and are now maturing. In Branded
Cards, the NCL rate came in at 3.65%, in line with our expectations. In Retail Services, the NCL rate of 6.32%
was slightly above the high end of our guidance range for the full year and will likely remain above the range
in the second quarter, reflecting historical seasonality patterns. However, given the persistent inflation,
higher interest rates and continued sales pressure at our partners, we now expect to be closer to the high
end of the full year NCL guidance range for Retail Services. This expectation, along with the continued mix
shift from transactors to revolvers across both portfolios, led to an ACL build of approximately $340 million.
Net income decreased to $347 million. Average deposits decreased 10%, as the transfer of relationships and
the associated deposits to our Wealth business more than offset the underlying growth. RoTCE for the

OPERATOR",MODERATOR,"Our first question will come from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Please go
ahead.",18,7,9,0.6,qa_session
Citigroup,First,MIKE MAYO,OTHER,"Hi. Well, you just finished your seventh month of your org simplification and you said 7,000
positions go away, with $1.5 billion of expense savings. So that's very concrete, but more generally, after 20,
30, 40 years of matrix structure down to five lines of business, you're reporting these differently, you're
talking about them differently, but the question that I think a lot of people have is, are you simply reporting
these lines of business differently, or are you actually running them differently? Thanks.",84,7,10,0.6,opening_remarks
Citigroup,First,JANE FRASER,OTHER,"Thank you, Mike, for the question. The simplification that we've just gone through, it is what
we said it is. It is the most consequential set of changes, not only to the organization model that we have but
how we run the bank. It's aligned the structure with the strategy. It's simplified the bank. It's eliminated
needless complexity. It's created greater transparency into the five businesses and their performance as you
can see. It's increased accountability. And very simply, it's just easier for our people to focus on our clients,
but also getting things done and the execution that we have ahead of us.
So maybe if I try and bring this a bit more alive, the first thing we did was we elevated the five businesses and
that eliminated the ICG and PBWM layer, and we brought all the elements that the businesses needed to run
end-to-end under the direct management of those five business heads, an example being operations. It's
enabled transparency, greater accountability, and this end-to-end and total P&L focus, so focus on the
bottom line and the returns driving growth, expense discipline, etcetera.
We also right-placed businesses to align with the strategy, so Banking all being under one umbrella, the
Investment Bank, the Corporate Bank, Commercial Bank, really helping us drive synergies there. Putting F&S
and Securitization into Markets, so that we have a unified spread product there, also beginning to see the
benefits of that this quarter.
So that's an example in the businesses, but I do want to highlight a couple of other areas around this change.

Citigroup,First,GLENN SCHORR,OTHER,"Thanks very much. So I think it shows how much you've helped us see the simpler
organization. I think people have totally bought into the expense story, so a lot of credit to you guys. I think
where I, personally, and others still have questions on is on the revenue side and getting to those 4% to 5%
medium-term targets.
So, could you take us just conceptually where we're going to where you think you'll drive that growth from,
from this baseline where we're at now? And if you want, you can totally use my second question in there and
tell us what good things you're doing inside the Investment Banking line.",112,8,13,0.6,opening_remarks
Citigroup,First,JANE FRASER,OTHER,"You snuck that one in, Glenn. So I'll kick off with some of this, pass it to Mark and then I'll
come back to Banking. So look, we are laser-focused on the growth and improving the returns of these
businesses to where they should and will be in the medium term, and it's not just the growth story, but let
me anchor it in those medium-term return targets.
In Services, we want to continue around the mid-20s in RoTCE. Banking should be getting to around 15%.
Markets 10% to 13%, so we'd like to see it at the higher end of that range. USPB getting that back to the mid-
teens and then moving on to the high-teens in the medium term. And then lastly, as Andy and Mark have
talked about, getting Wealth to a 15% to 20% return in the medium term, but the goal is to the mid-20s in
Copyright © 2024 Citigroup Inc. 8",158,8,14,0.6,general_discussion
Citigroup,First,MARK MASON,OTHER,"Sure. And good morning, Glenn, and we appreciate the acknowledgment around the
expenses. As you know, we've been quite focused on that and working hard to ensure that we deliver on what
we say we're going to do there.
I'd point on the revenue line, I'd first point to, if you look back, since Investor Day, we've in fact been able to
deliver on the guidance that we've given for the medium term, so that 4% to 5% top line growth. And, yes, it
was a different rate environment, but that growth that we delivered over the past couple of years has been a
mix of both revenue and underlying business strength.
As you think about the guidance we talked about for this year, we talked about the NII ex-Markets being
down modestly. And so what that means is that the momentum and the growth that we expect is going to
come from the non-interest revenue. And I think this quarter is a good example of where and how that's likely
to play through, so the revenue top line being up 3-plus percent, but when you look through each of the
businesses, and if you look on each of the pages where we disclose the revenue, you can see the underlying
NIR growth in the bottom left hand corner of each of those pages, that's coming through as well. So Services
up 14% with growth in both TTS, between cross-border, clearing, commercial cards, but also and Securities
Services, right, with the growth that we're seeing from continued momentum in assets under custody. We
expect that trend to continue with existing clients and new clients as well as how we do more with our
commercial market commercial middle market business, excuse me. So NIR growth there.
The Investment Banking piece is the other driver of fees. We're seeing that wallet start to rebound. We're part
of that rebound. The announced transactions, we're part of those in sectors that we've been investing in.
We're bringing in new talent to help us realize and experience that.
And even in Wealth, where we're not pleased with the top line performance this quarter of down 4%. When
you look through that, we do have good underlying NIR1 growth in the quarter in Wealth and that's up 11%
year-over-year and it's in the area that Andy and the team is leaning in on which is investments and not just
in one region, but across all the regions.
And then finally, the USPB piece which is showing good NIR1 growth as well, so the long and short of it is that
the 4% growth that's implied in $80 billion to $81 billion is going to be continued momentum, largely in fees,
helping us to deliver for our clients and make continued progress towards that medium-term target.",469,9,15,0.6,opening_remarks
Citigroup,First,JANE FRASER,OTHER,"So let me pick up, I'm sure Jenn Landis will give us the evil eye for sneaking in a second
question there, Glenn, but let me pick up on Banking and what's going on there. So we have a very clear
strategy that we've been executing over the last couple of years, really to lay the foundation for growth in
Banking.
North America is our key priority. It's the biggest contributor to the global IB wallet. Tech, healthcare and
industrials are likely to constitute over 50% of the fee wallet going forward. So we have better aligned our
resources to position the franchise for this. Defending areas of traditional strength in industrials and the like,
energy, whilst investing in high-growth sectors such as healthcare and technology with some strong talent.

Securities business already on moving that expense ratio a little bit. Could we dig in a little bit on the Wealth
side, because the expense ratio there is running a little higher, and so, it'd be useful just to understand the
pace or speed or timeframe when we should expect to see that start to inflect.",71,10,19,0.6,guidance
Citigroup,First,JANE FRASER,OTHER,"Yes, absolutely. And some of it, just as a reminder, the actions that we've been taking on org
simplification and that Andy has also been taking in the Wealth business. We will work through notice
periods in the coming weeks. And so, you'll start you'll see the impact coming through in our head count
numbers, and in Wealth, in the expense base next quarter. Look, as Mark said in his opening and Andy has
been talking about, this should be a sort of up to a 30% pre-tax margin business.
Andy is focused on rationalizing the expense base. He's also, as Mark said, turning on the growth engine. He's
enhancing our platforms and capabilities to elevate the client experience. The heart of the opportunity for us
lies with our existing clients. They are an extraordinary client base, but they're underpenetrated. So, a lot of
the operating efficiency is frankly going to be is going to come on the revenue side here. That said, Andy's
taken a number of pretty decisive moves this quarter on the expense side.

Citigroup,First,JIM MITCHELL,OTHER,"Okay. Good morning. Jane and Mark, I very much appreciate the comments on your growth
opportunities and driving growth. But revenues are often dictated by the macro that is a little bit out of your
control. So, can you talk a little bit about the flexibility on the expenses? You have a range in 2026 of $51
billion to $53 billion. So, if revenues are coming in below the targets, is it, I guess, A, fair to assume you'd be
at the very low-end of that range or is and I think there is some revenue growth built in there. So, is there
some flexibility to the downside to try to get to your targets in a tougher revenue environment? Thanks.",121,11,23,0.6,opening_remarks
Citigroup,First,MARK MASON,OTHER,"Yeah. Look, the top line growth, as you've heard us say, is a CAGR of 4% to 5%. We've put
that target out there of $51 billion to $53 billion as a range of what we're working towards. We've given you a
good sense of how we expect to get there with the $2 billion to $2.5 billion reduction by then. We've already
signaled $1.5 billion that's in front of us.
The reality is that if there's softness in revenues, that's why we have a range, obviously, the volume-related
expenses would come down with any softness in revenue. And depending on the drivers of why that revenue
is softening, we'd look at the investments that we're making across the business and make sure that those
are appropriately calibrated for where we are in the cycle and what we're seeing on the top line.
With that said, we've got to continue to invest in the Transformation. We're not going to compromise that.
That's going to be something that we have to spend on to ensure we continue to get right. But that's kind of
how the dynamic works. There's a top we've got a mix of businesses that I think we've demonstrated
resiliency around if you think about the past couple of years, and we expect for those to continue to drive
some top line momentum. But we've got levers in case they don't.",233,11,24,0.6,financial_results

Citigroup,First,OPERATOR,MODERATOR,Our next question is from Erika Najarian at UBS. Please unmute your line and ask your question.,17,12,28,0.6,qa_session
Citigroup,First,ERIKA NAJARIAN,OTHER,"Hi. Good afternoon. So, clearly, the theme of this that's emerging on the Q&A is a healthy
skepticism about the revenue targets in line with the in light of the expense declines, which is not really us
analysts, we're sort of a little bit parroting what we're hearing from long-only investors that haven't yet
jumped into the stock. So, to that end, I guess I'm going to ask Ebrahim's question differently, and then ask
a question about card late fees.
How are you balancing clearly, your valuation would demand that the buybacks be ramped up from $500
million. But growing revenues at a 4% to 5% CAGR would mean potentially some capital plowed back into
the business. I guess how are you balancing that, especially given that the demand for buyback is louder at
Citi than any other money center peer? And could you give us a sense of what card late fees are and how that
would impact the $80 billion to $81 billion for the year if we do get an earlier implementation than October?",177,12,29,0.6,opening_remarks
Citigroup,First,MARK MASON,OTHER,"Yeah. Thank you, Erika. On the first part of the question, I'd just remind you and everyone
else that we're playing for the long-term here, right. So, we have set some medium-term targets. Obviously,
Jane has recasted the vision and the strategy. I think we're making very good progress against that, but we're
playing for the long-term. And what that means is that we have to continue to invest in the franchise.
It's why I've given you a range around the expenses, at least in part. It's why I've continued to stress the
importance of protecting the Transformation and risk and control spend. And it's why I started the answer
to Ebrahim's question by saying that we want to be sure that we can match the client demand out there,
where the returns to do so makes sense. And so, we are having to balance kind of the use of capital and other
resources against that longer term strategic objective and utilize it where it makes sense and generates good
returns against the idea of returning that to shareholders.
And so, we'll continue to do that. It's an everyday assessment. It's an everyday discussion with the teams.
Frankly, it's why things like the revenue sharing has been put in place to intensify the discussion around the
clients that we're using balance sheet with and ensuring that we're driving broader revenues across the
platform. And so, that's kind of how we're operating in terms of making that trade-off on a regular basis, in
addition to obviously the broader regulatory environment that we're in.
In terms of the second part of your question around late fees, we haven't disclosed kind of the dollar amount
of the late fees. What I would say is that we did and have factored that into the $80 billion to $81 billion. And
the only thing I'd add to that is it did kind of it's being implemented a bit earlier than what we had assumed.
But again, it's inside of the range of the guidance that I've given you for top line revenue for the year.",350,12,30,0.6,opening_remarks

ahead.",17,13,32,0.6,qa_session
Citigroup,First,JOHN MCDONALD,OTHER,"Thanks. Mark, I was hoping you'd give a little more color on how you're feeling about the
credit card charge-offs. You maintained the outlook for the year. You mentioned the higher end on Retail
Services. Do you still feel like you'll see a peak this year? And what kind of metrics are you looking at in terms
of delinquency formation and seasoning to inform that view that you might see the peak in card charge-offs
this year?",77,13,33,0.6,opening_remarks
Citigroup,First,MARK MASON,OTHER,"Yeah. Thanks, John. We have obviously continued to manage this portfolio very actively.
We've seen continued top line growth. We've seen continued average interest-earning balance growth. We've
talked about how we expect for the cost of credit to normalize, and we've seen that continue to happen. The
range that we've given on Branded Cards, we're inside of that range. When you look at the spend across the
portfolios, the spend is really happening with the affluent customers more so than anything else. And so,
we're watching the lower income customer profile or customers that we have. But again, as Jane
mentioned, we tend to skew to the higher end to begin with.
Where we're really seeing the pressure is where I mentioned in terms of Retail Services. And so, there, the
current NCLs are higher than the high-end of the full year range that I've given. But if you look back, that is
not inconsistent with seasonality that we've seen in the past in that portfolio, where the first two quarters
are higher than the back half of the year, in part because of coming out of the holiday season and how losses
tend to mature or materialize through that process.
And so, I'd expect to not only see them be higher than the average range in Q1, but also in Q2 before coming
down. And then, I still expect that in 2025, you tend to see them further normalize and come down a bit off
of these ranges. But look, the reality is that we continue to watch it, and the factors that are out there that
are important include how unemployment evolves, what happens with inflation, what happens with interest
rates, and those will be important factors as to how the loss rates continue to evolve over time.
I think the final point I'd make and I mentioned it in the prepared remarks is that we have to remember that
the loss rates in both portfolios reflect kind of multiple vintages maturing at the same time. And you'll recall,
and this is an industry dynamic, through the COVID pandemic period, losses were at an all-time low,
payment rates at all-time highs, supported by government stimulus.
And now coming out of that, we're seeing the COVID vintages mature, albeit at a lagged pace from what
would be normal, and we're seeing the incremental acquisitions that we've done start to mature at their
normal pace. And so, these loss rates are exacerbated by that impact and that's an important factor we can't
lose sight of. But the bottom line is that we're watching it. The macro factors matter. We feel good about the
quality mix that we have, and we'll kind of see how things evolve from here.",458,13,34,0.6,opening_remarks

Citigroup,First,KEN USDIN,OTHER,"Great. Thanks. Can I follow up on the card line of thinking and just ask you, Mark, to talk a little
bit about just cost of credit? We did still see some card related build this quarter even with the comments
you just made and seasonal softer loan growth So, just from a bigger picture perspective, how do you think,
continue to think about reserve builds from here and how that informs your outlook for cost of credit?",78,14,38,0.6,opening_remarks
Citigroup,First,MARK MASON,OTHER,"Yeah, sure. Look, I think that when I think about the reserve builds, I think it's the same
factors that come into play. So, obviously, the view on the macro is important. And right now, if you think
about some of the key macro factors that impact the cards portfolio, the unemployment assumptions
weighted is about 5%, the downside is about 7% kind of weighted over the period. And so, how that evolves
will be an important factor. How HPI evolves would be an important consideration here for this portfolio, but
also what happens with volumes becomes a factor on reserve builds and how important or how much they
increase or decrease.
And then the final piece is mix, and it's kind of related to that revolver point. As we see the mix evolve from
transactors to revolvers, that's going to play into how much of a reserve from a lifetime point of view we have
to continue to build. And so, it's why I mentioned on John's question the importance of looking at the interest
rates, looking at what's happening with inflation, watching the lower income customer base, because all of
those things combined with how we think about the scenarios and the weighting will be a factor on the
reserves.

levels. The 8.2% for combined kind of",244,14,39,0.6,financial_results

what are your thoughts about that piece of the NII puzzle going forward? Thanks.",71,14,40,0.8,opening_remarks
Citigroup,First,MARK MASON,OTHER,"Sure, yeah. I mean, I think I'd say a couple things. We do have kind of some Argentina playing
through the NII line. I will say that the best way to think about it is kind of the underlying beta activity. And
we have seen, this is the corporate client, it is an institutional client. We have seen betas, particularly in the
US, at kind of normalized or terminal levels and playing a bit through that. We are seeing betas outside of the
US continue to increase as it relates to the TTS client base.
But all of that again is inside of the range that we've talked about. I don't expect to see kind of year-over-year
growth on the NII line anywhere close to kind of what we've seen in prior years, prior quarters, just in light of
kind of how the rate environments evolved, and in light of kind of quantitative tightening and the impact on
deposit levels. The last point I'd make on this is, we will continue to drive and see growth as it relates to the
operating deposits, and that will be an important tailwind that kind of plays through.",195,14,41,0.6,guidance

Citigroup,First,SCOTT SIEFERS,OTHER,"Hey, everyone. Thanks for taking the question. Mark, I think you touched on at least a
component of this a couple questions ago, but maybe just broadly an update on your rate positioning. I guess
I only ask, because it looks like we might be starting to diverge in terms of global rate trajectories, if we
potentially go lower in Europe, but higher here for a while. In the aggregate, do these kind of complicate your
management or make you feel better or worse about the overall NII momentum for the company?",92,15,46,0.6,opening_remarks
Citigroup,First,MARK MASON,OTHER,"Yeah, let me try and take it in, in two pieces, I guess. So one is, if I think about how the rate
implieds have evolved from the 3 to 6 to now something a little bit north of 1 in the context of what I expect
for our performance, it doesn't have a material impact on the guidance that I've given of $80 billion to $81
billion.
And in part, that's because as I think about the timing for the planned cuts, which was generally back-loaded,
as well as some of the other factors that play through. So, you know, Argentina just announced a policy rate
reduction yesterday or a couple of days ago. If rates are a bit higher for longer, we'll watch how the betas
continue to evolve. I mentioned earlier, the late fees for the cards business happened a bit sooner. Late fees
are actually booked in our NII line. And so, those factors put me in a place where I feel like there will certainly
be puts and takes around how that rate curve evolves, and therefore I'm very comfortable kind of leaving the
guidance where it is.
To answer your broader question, in terms of kind of how we are positioned, I'd point you to the 10-K that we
have that's out. And in that 10-K, we offer as we have before a number of IRE scenarios for plus or minus 100
basis points and what it means for our business. And if you look at it, you'll see that for the aggregate firm,
for Citi, US dollar and non-US dollar, that we're asset-sensitive. So, as rates increase, we should see an
increase in our NII performance.
But if you look at the breakdown and that's about I think it was about $1.4 billion or something in terms of
the impact of that move. But if you look at the breakdown, what the breakdown will show is that for US dollar,
at this point we're neutral. So, if rates were to go up, rates were to go down, no material impact as it relates
to our revenue.
For the non-US dollar, we're still quite asset-sensitive, right? And so, that should give you some sense for
and we recognize the limitations with IRE, it assumes 100 basis point parallel shift across the curve to a static
balance sheet, etcetera, but that should give you some sense for the implications of the rate curve moves as
it relates to our book of business.",417,15,47,0.6,financial_results

conversation around the credit card charge-offs and the credit quality there. If we could shift over to the
corporate side, which obviously is very strong, we have seen spreads narrow in the markets on high-yield
corporate debt, leverage debt, etcetera. It's very robust out there, but around the global geopolitical risk, do
you think the spreads would be widening? Can you guys share with us what you're seeing on the corporate
side in terms of competition? Are underwriting standards getting a little bit weaker now as people are trying
to grow their books, what are you seeing on that front?
Copyright © 2024 Citigroup Inc. 15",122,15,49,0.6,risk_discussion
Citigroup,First,MARK MASON,OTHER,"So, look, we're still seeing good demand for corporate credit. And what I'd say is that we've
been very disciplined about where we want to play on the risk profile here. We've been very disciplined in
terms of the investment-grade large multinationals that we serve. And that hasn't shifted from an
underwriting point of view. We have seen spaces like private credit pick up quite a bit, and that I think will
continue to evolve.
I think importantly, as we think about our Corporate Lending activity, you'll note that actually we've been
very disciplined about how we want to deploy balance sheet. And part of that again is a by-product of the
revenue sharing that we've implemented, where there's been healthy debate and discussion around the
names that we want to continue to serve, and whether they're positioned to take advantage of the broader
platform that we have.
And so, I think the space will continue to evolve. I think there's been good, healthy demand, despite
continued strong balance sheets and part of that demand has been because of where rates are likely to go
and continue to evolve. And I think we're well-positioned to be thoughtful about that, but Jane, you may
want to add a couple points to it.",211,16,50,0.6,financial_results
Citigroup,First,JANE FRASER,OTHER,"Yeah, look, around the world, the corporate client base and our Commercial Banking mid-
market client base have very healthy balance sheets and we're also seeing market access gradually opening
up as well, which is also helpful for to the quality issuers across all asset classes. We're seeing both the
issuers taking advantage as well as the investors. The deals are well over-subscribed. So, that's also been
beneficial as corporates think about their financing needs.
The other piece I just pop out there as well is the recent large M&A announcements in multiple industries
is a sign of rising confidence from CEOs and boards and active discussions are increasing, as supportive
capital markets create confidence, as people think about larger strategic transactions. This is going to feed
acquisition finance, bridge financing and some of the higher-margin capital markets and lending activity as
well.
So, as we look forward, I think it's recognizing the shift in some of the drivers from company just investing,
refinancing, looking at where they can diversify their capital raising in different quarters. But I'd just close by
saying I couldn't agree with you more about geopolitical risks and fragility. I think the market's too benign in

depressed earnings last year, want to get a sense as to whether there are any idio-factors that could result

you, right. I mean it's we obviously have an internal based scenario we've run. We have a severely adverse
scenario that we've run. We've provided a balance sheet as part of the submission, but ultimately, the
regulators have to run through their models, the information that we've provided and that informs what
happens with the stress capital buffer, and we don't have as much transparency to that as we'd like and so

predictable and repeatable revenue streams that would impact PPNR, the simplification which obviously

in the past you've talked about the fact that 1Q will be a little elevated with the restructuring. And you showed
that was the $225 million in the quarter, and then when we look to 2Q, we should should we still be
expecting a step-down in 2Q? And is that step-down just the elimination of the $225 million or is there some
restructuring that we're likely to see in 2Q as well? In other words, should I just fade sequentially 2Q, 3Q, 4Q
to hit your annual number or is there a bigger step-down in 2Q that I should still be expecting here? Thanks.",123,19,73,0.6,opening_remarks
Citigroup,First,MARK MASON,OTHER,"Sure. I think you should just fade it, to answer your question very directly, but I'd also point
out that in Q1, if you really look through to it, it has the $250 million of FDIC charge in it, and so when you
back that out, we effectively are coming in lower than what we had guided right. Despite that I'm telling you
the same I'm making the same point, which is you can expect a downward trend from here through to the
end of the year and while there won't be additional restructuring charge, there will be the normal BAU activity
around repositioning that plays through, so hopefully that answers your question, Betsy. The guidance still
holds, and the downward trend is what we are managing towards, as we kind of play out the balance of the
year.",139,19,74,0.6,guidance
Citigroup,First,OPERATOR,MODERATOR,There are no further questions. I will turn the call over to Jenn Landis for closing remarks.,17,19,75,0.6,qa_session
