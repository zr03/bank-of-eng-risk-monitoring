"OPERATOR: Hello and welcome to Citi's First Quarter 2025 Earnings Call. Today's call will be hosted by Jenn Landis, Head of Citi Investor Relations. We ask that you please hold all questions until the completion of the formal remarks at which time you will be given instructions for the question-and-answer session. Also, as a reminder, this conference is being recorded today. If you have any objections, please disconnect at this time. 

Ms. Landis, you may begin.

JENNIFER LANDIS: Thank you, operator. Good morning and thank you all for joining our first quarter 2025 earnings call. I am joined today by our Chief Executive Officer, Jane Fraser, and our Chief Financial Officer, Mark Mason.

I'd like to remind you that today's presentation, which is available for download on our website, citigroup.com, may contain forward-looking statements which are based on management's current expectations and are subject to uncertainty and changes in circumstances. Actual results may differ materially from these statements due to a variety of factors, including those described in our earnings materials as well as in our SEC filings.

And with that, I'll turn it over to Jane.",Jennifer Landis,Host,1,Introduction
"JANE FRASER: Thank you, Jenn, and a very good morning to everyone. First, I am going to discuss our first quarter results and then talk about the environment we are operating in and how we are positioning the bank for it. 
This morning, we reported net income of $4.1 billion and earnings per share of $1.96 with an RoTCE of 9.1%.  Overall, it was a strong quarter, marked by continued momentum in each of our five businesses.  We maintained a disciplined approach to our expenses, which declined by 5% year-over-year.  We delivered our third consecutive quarter of positive operating leverage for each of our five lines of business and the fourth consecutive quarter for the firm overall.   
We increased both our return on tangible common equity in each business and our return of capital to our shareholders.  This quarter is a further proof point of how the consistent execution of our strategy is improving our performance.",Jane Fraser,CEO,1,Prepared remarks
"Services recorded its highest first quarter revenue in a decade. TTS continues to demonstrate momentum in the key underlying drivers across U.S. dollar clearing and cross-border activity.  Securities Services gained share and grew its Assets Under Custody and Administration to $26 trillion.
Markets had a good quarter with revenue up 12%.  The three most significant Fixed Income businesses – Rates, Spread Products and FX – each contributed to an overall 8% increase over last year.  And in a good macro quarter for Equities, we were up 23% as we continued with our long-term strategy to augment our high derivatives share with a larger prime business.
Banking was up 12%, as we continue to gain share in Investment Banking across most industry sectors.  Most notably M&A revenue nearly doubled.  We are seeing the benefits of our talent investments – as you can see by the leading role we played in some of the year’s biggest transactions such as advising Altair on the Siemens acquisition and on the recently announced Intra-Cellular transaction by J&J.",Jane Fraser,CEO,1,Prepared remarks
"Turning to Wealth, all three businesses contributed to overall growth of 24% and fee revenue drove non-interest revenue growth of 16%. We remain focused on capturing assets our clients have “off” us as demonstrated by the roughly 11% organic growth in client investment assets.  Andy and his new team are making excellent progress executing our strategy, with the business delivering record revenue this quarter and improved efficiency and returns.
USPB was up 2%, driven mainly by increased loan balances and spending in Branded Cards.  The high credit quality of our cards portfolio reflects the focus we have put on prime consumers and our portfolio continued to perform in line with our expectations.  Overall, USPB’s return increased to nearly 13%.",Jane Fraser,CEO,2,Prepared remarks
"During the quarter, we returned $2.8 billion in capital to our shareholders including $1.75 billion of buybacks as part of our $20 billion plan, which is about $250 million more than we had originally guided.  That’s our highest quarterly amount since 2022 and demonstrates our commitment to returning capital.  We ended the quarter with a CET1 ratio of 13.4% and our tangible book value per share crossed $90.
Turning to our strategic priorities, our transformation investments continue to modernize our infrastructure, simplify our processes, and reduce manual touchpoints.  During the quarter, we retired legacy applications and automated reconciliations to name but a few accomplishments.
We are also integrating AI directly into our business operations to improve the client experience.  The latest example is “Agent Assist,” our first generative AI tool for customer service in U.S. Personal Banking.  It is designed to help our team resolve inquiries faster and it is now being piloted in credit cards.",Jane Fraser,CEO,2,Prepared remarks
"From quarter to quarter, we are building on our track record of progress, and I am confident in our ability to continue delivering despite the uncertainty of the moment.   
In terms of the macro environment, I am not going to try to predict the unpredictable.  While our corporate and consumer clients are resilient and in good financial health, the world is in a wait-and-see mode and is facing a more negative macro-outlook than anyone had anticipated at the beginning of the year. And we know that prolonged uncertainty generally hurts confidence.
The changes underway globally will go beyond trade and tariffs.  In the U.S. for example, regulation and tax policy are all likely to look different in a year’s time.  These changes will not only have economic impacts but geopolitical and cultural ones as well.   
We appreciate the Administration taking a fresh look at regulations across all industries to unlock growth.  We welcome the changes being discussed in our own industry to place more focus on material financial risks and to make it easier for banks to contribute to economic growth and to improve client service.",Jane Fraser,CEO,2,Prepared remarks
"When all is said and done, and these long-standing trade imbalances and other structural shifts are behind us, the U.S. will still be the world’s leading economy, and the dollar will remain the reserve currency.
The deep knowledge and breadth of capabilities that we have from decades on the ground in so many local markets are real points of distinction when serving our clients, from reconfiguring their supply chains, to addressing their hedging and funding approaches, to advising on their strategic agendas.   
I am very confident that we have built a strategy based on a diversified business mix that will perform in a wide variety of macro scenarios and is differentiating in times like these.
With capital strength, plentiful liquidity and strong reserves, we can navigate through any environment from a position of strength.  In periods of stress, we have shown that we are a port during the storm for our clients, the global markets, and the economy, and this time is no different.  We are ready to lean in.
As I look forward to the rest of the year, we shall remain disciplined about returning capital and managing our expenses whilst protecting necessary investments in our businesses as well as our transformation.  And we shall not allow the uncertainty to distract us from executing our strategy and improving our returns.",Jane Fraser,CEO,2,Prepared remarks
"Now, over to Mark and then we would be happy to take your questions.",Jane Fraser,CEO,3,Prepared remarks
"MARK MASON: Thanks, Jane and good morning, everyone. I am going to start with the firmwide financial results, focusing on year-over-year comparisons unless I indicate otherwise, and then review the performance of our businesses in greater detail.
On slide 6, we show financial results for the full firm. This quarter we reported net income of $4.1 billion, EPS of $1.96 and an RoTCE of 9.1% on $21.6 billion of revenues, generating positive operating leverage for the firm and in each of our five businesses. Total revenues were up 3%, driven by growth in each of our businesses largely offset by a decline in All Other. Net interest income excluding Markets was up 2%, driven by USPB, Wealth and Services, largely offset by declines in All Other and Banking. Non-interest revenues excluding Markets were down 6%, as better results in Banking and Wealth were more than offset by declines in All Other, USPB and Services. And total Markets revenues were up 12%. Expenses of $13.4 billion, were down 5%. Cost of credit was $2.7 billion, primarily consisting of net credit losses in Cards as well as a firmwide net ACL build, reflecting the uncertainty and deterioration in the macroeconomic outlook.",Mark Mason,CFO,3,Prepared remarks
"Before I move on, I would like to note that certain card transaction processing fees paid primarily to networks were previously presented in operating expenses and are now presented as a contra-revenue in non-interest revenue, primarily impacting USPB. This change does not impact net income, and prior periods have been aligned. We’ve provided additional detail in the appendix of the presentation on slide 22.",Mark Mason,CFO,3,Prepared remarks
"On slide 7, we show the expense trend over the past five quarters. As we’ve said in the past, we are very focused on bringing down our expense base. At the same time, the transformation remains our #1 priority, and we will continue to make the investments needed, specifically as it relates to data and regulatory reporting. Having said that, the drivers of our expense reduction going forward remain consistent with those that we have referenced in the past. Savings related to stranded cost reduction, productivity from our prior investments and our organizational simplification, all of which allow us to self-fund our investments in transformation. As we look at this quarter, expenses declined by 5%, which included a favorable FX impact. The decline was driven by a smaller FDIC special assessment, absence of a restructuring charge and lower compensation. Partially offset by increases in technology and communications, professional fees related to transformation, as well as advertising and marketing. And looking at the rest of the year, we remain on track to meet our full year expense target.",Mark Mason,CFO,3,Prepared remarks
"On slide 8, we show key consumer and corporate credit metrics. As I mentioned, the firm’s cost of credit was $2.7 billion, primarily consisting of net credit losses in cards as well as a firmwide net ACL build. The ACL build reflects uncertainty and deterioration in the macroeconomic outlook, including a further skew to the downside scenario in our CECL framework. Our reserves now incorporate an eight-quarter weighted average unemployment rate of 5.1%, which includes a downside scenario average unemployment rate of 6.7%. Largely offsetting this build was a release related to lower balances in our card portfolios. At the end of the quarter, we had $22.8 billion in total reserves with a reserve-to-funded loans ratio of 2.7%. Now turning to consumer credit on the left-hand side of the page, approximately 85% of our card portfolios are to consumers with FICO scores of 660 or higher. NCL rates increased sequentially in both card portfolios, consistent with historical seasonal patterns, and we continue to see stabilization in delinquency rates across both portfolios. And our reserve to funded loan ratio in our card portfolio is 8.2%. And corporate non-accrual loans remain low, reflecting the investment grade nature of our portfolio. Based on the quality and mix of our portfolio we believe we are well-reserved, but as always, we continue to monitor the evolving macroeconomic outlook.",Mark Mason,CFO,3,Prepared remarks
"Turning to slide 9, where I will speak to sequential variances. Citi’s $2.6 trillion balance sheet increased 9% driven by growth in trading-related assets, which is typical given the seasonal increase in Markets activity. We also built our cash position as we let investment securities roll off and opportunistically issued long-term debt. Loans increased 1%, driven by Services and Markets, largely offset by lower balances in cards. Our $1.3 trillion deposit base remains well-diversified across regions, industries, customers and account types, and increased 2%, primarily driven by Services. We reported 117% average LCR and maintained $960 billion of available liquidity resources. We ended the quarter with a preliminary 13.4% CET1 Capital ratio, down approximately 20 basis points, as net income was more than offset by capital distributions, RWA growth and higher DTA deductions. We continue to feel very good about the strength and quality of our balance sheet, and our robust capital and liquidity position us well to support our clients in a range of economic environments.",Mark Mason,CFO,3,Prepared remarks
"Turning to the businesses on slide 10, we show the results for Services in the first quarter. Services revenues were up 3%, driven by growth in TTS. NII increased 5%, driven by higher deposit spreads as well as an increase in deposit and loan balances. NIR declined 4%, driven by the absence of certain episodic fees in Securities Services as well as higher revenue share and the impact of FX across both TTS and Securities Services. That said, we continue to see strength in underlying fee drivers across the business, as you can see on the bottom right-hand side of the page. Expenses declined 3%, largely driven by lower deposit insurance costs, severance and legal expenses. Average loans increased 6%, driven by continued demand for export agency finance as well as working capital loans. Average deposits increased 2% as we continue to see growth in operating deposits. Services generated positive operating leverage for the third consecutive quarter and delivered net income of $1.6 billion, and continued to deliver a high RoTCE of 26.2%.",Mark Mason,CFO,4,Prepared remarks
"On slide 11, we show the results for Markets in the first quarter. Markets revenues were up 12%, driven by growth across both Fixed Income and Equities. Fixed Income revenues increased 8%, with Rates and Currencies up 9%, reflecting increased client activity and monetization. And Spread Products and Other Fixed Income, up 7%, driven by higher client activity and loan growth. Equities revenues increased 23%, primarily driven by Equity Derivatives, on increased market volatility and higher client activity, and momentum in Prime Services, with Prime balances up approximately 16%. Expenses increased 2%, driven by higher volume and other revenue-related expenses. Cost of credit was $201 million, primarily related to Spread Products, driven by net credit losses and a net ACL build. Average loans increased 7%, driven by financing activity in Spread Products. Markets generated positive operating leverage for the fourth consecutive quarter and delivered net income of $1.8 billion and an RoTCE of 14.3%.",Mark Mason,CFO,4,Prepared remarks
"On slide 12, we show the results for Banking in the first quarter. Banking revenues were up 12%, driven by growth in Investment Banking as well as the impact of mark-to-market on loan hedges, partially offset by a decline in Corporate Lending. Investment Banking fees increased 14%, with growth in M&A partially offset by declines in DCM and ECM. M&A was up 84%, as we gained share overall and across numerous sectors. DCM was down 3% compared to a near-record first quarter last year. And ECM was down 26%, amid a pullback in the wallet for follow-ons and convertibles. Corporate Lending revenues, excluding mark-to-market on loan hedges, declined 1%, as increases in revenue share were more than offset by the combined impact of lower loan balances and higher recoveries in the prior year. Expenses declined 12%, largely driven by lower compensation, as we see the benefits of our prior actions to right-size the workforce and expense base. Cost of credit was $214 million, consisting of an ACL build of $180 million, driven by changes in the macroeconomic outlook, and net credit losses. Banking generated positive operating leverage for the fifth consecutive quarter, and delivered net income of $543 million and an RoTCE of 10.7%.",Mark Mason,CFO,4,Prepared remarks
"On slide 13, we show the results for Wealth in the first quarter. Wealth revenues were up 24%, with growth across Citigold, the Private Bank and Wealth at Work. NII increased 30%, driven by higher deposit spreads partially offset by lower deposit balances. And NIR increased 16%, primarily driven by growth in investment fee revenues, as we grew client investment assets by 16%. This includes net new investment assets of $16.5 billion in the quarter and over $56 billion in the last 12 months, representing approximately 11% organic growth. Expenses were roughly flat, as the benefits of our prior actions to right-size the workforce and expense base as well as lower technology expenses were offset by higher revenue-related expenses and severance. End-of-period client balances increased 7%, driven by higher net new investment asset flows and market valuations. Average loans declined 2%, as we continue to be strategic in deploying the balance sheet to support growth in client investment assets. Average deposits also declined 2%, driven by a shift in deposits to higher-yielding investments on Citi’s platform and other operating outflows, largely offset by client transfers from USPB, reflecting our ability to support clients as their wealth and investment needs evolve. Wealth had a pre-tax margin of 17% and generated positive operating leverage for the fourth consecutive quarter, and delivered net income of $284 million and an RoTCE of 9.4%.",Mark Mason,CFO,4,Prepared remarks
"On slide 14, we show the results for U.S. Personal Banking in the first quarter. U.S. Personal Banking revenues were up 2%, driven by growth in Branded Cards and Retail Banking, largely offset by a decline in Retail Services. Branded Cards revenues increased 9%, with interest-earning balance growth of 8% and we continue to see spend growth, which was up 3%. Retail Banking revenues increased 17%, driven by the impact of higher deposit spreads. And in Retail Services revenues declined 11%, primarily driven by higher partner payment accruals. Expenses were roughly flat, due to continued productivity savings offset by higher advertising and marketing as well as legal expenses. Cost of credit was $1.8 billion, consisting of net credit losses, partially offset by a net ACL release of $172 million. This included a build related to changes in the portfolio composition and macroeconomic outlook, which was more than offset by a release due to lower card balances, largely in Retail Services. Notwithstanding this release, our cards reserve to funded loan ratio increased to 8.2% from 7.9% last quarter. Average deposits declined 11%, driven by client transfers to Wealth that I just mentioned. USPB generated positive operating leverage for the tenth consecutive quarter and delivered net income of $745 million and an RoTCE of 12.9%.",Mark Mason,CFO,5,Prepared remarks
"On slide 15, we show results for All Other on a managed basis, which includes Corporate/Other and Legacy Franchises and excludes divestiture-related items. Revenues declined 39%, with declines across both Corporate/Other and Legacy Franchises. Corporate/Other was largely driven by lower NII as well as the impact of mark-to-market valuation changes on certain investments on NIR. Legacy Franchises was driven by the impact of Mexican peso depreciation, expiration of TSAs in our closed exit markets and continued reduction from our wind-down markets. Expenses declined 17%, driven by a smaller FDIC special assessment, absence of a restructuring charge, reduction from exit markets and wind-downs and the impact of Mexican peso depreciation. And cost of credit was $359 million, largely driven by net credit losses of $256 million, driven by consumer loans in Mexico.",Mark Mason,CFO,5,Prepared remarks
"On slide 16, I’ll briefly touch on our full year 2025 outlook, which we’ve adjusted for the impact of the card transaction processing fee presentation change that I mentioned earlier, but is otherwise unchanged. As you know, in January, we provided guidance for full year revenue and expenses as well as card NCLs – and that guidance was informed by a number of scenarios and assumptions. Based on what we know today, and assuming markets remain open and constructive, we still expect to deliver full year revenues of approximately $83.1 to $84.1 billion, with net interest income excluding Markets up approximately 2% to 3%. And we expect full year expenses to be slightly lower than $53.4 billion. Clearly there remains a lot of uncertainty, but we are confident that our diversified business model and resilient strategy can withstand many environments, and we remain well-positioned to support our clients. So, while a lot is changing around us, we remain steadfast and focused on continuing to execute on our transformation and strategy while remaining disciplined with our expenses and capital with an eye towards improving returns over time.  And with that. Jane and I would be happy to take your questions.",Mark Mason,CFO,5,Prepared remarks
OPERATOR: Our first question will come from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.,OPERATOR,other,5,Q and A
"GLENN SCHORR: Hi, thanks very much. So, I know it's early, but I'm curious if you could help us with a refresher on Treasury and Trade Solutions and Services in general. In terms of what opportunities there's risk, but also opportunities in helping clients manage through this re-tariffing and redrawing of economic lines. I think about nationalization and vertical integration as bad things, but a lot of shifting, and maybe you can help clients deal with all that shifting. But anything any help there would be great.",GLENN SCHORR,analyst,5,Q and A
"JANE FRASER: Glenn, I would be delighted to do so. So, our diversified business mix is very well positioned for a variety of scenarios. We think we've got a very broad suite of products and services. And they are the ones that clients need if they're going to be repositioning for a new order in trade or broader impacts here. And think about what you've seen over the last few years where we played a very central role: the Ukraine-Russia war, China, the COVID-related supply chains. We saw a lot of growth from deepening with clients and acquiring new ones because they need us, because we have exactly the expertise and the products and services that multinational institutions need, and we have them in the places that they need it. Now, the mix of those different revenues, different products and services we have could be different depending on which scenario prevails. And what I have to say at the moment, the level of engagement that we have with our clients all around the world, is just off the charts, given the unique depth of our presence and the insights we have in all the markets.",Jane Fraser,CEO,6,Q and A
"So, if I dig down a bit more, what would the persistence of high tariffs, what would it mean? Well, it would dampen economic activity here in the in the U.S. and abroad. Cross-border trade flows will change, we'll be in the middle of facilitating that. So, we expect to be very busy there along with the hedging and associated financing activity that goes with it because it's not just about TTS. This is about the bundle of different capabilities we bring to bear. And take some comfort, look at what happened with the Ukraine war. We grew a lot in that time period. Equally, most of our business is very local. Think of what Services is, it's payroll, it's supplier management, it's liquidity, it's payables, it's receivables. And we're very deeply embedded into our clients' day-to-day operations in every market they work in as well as across market flows. And that's not going to change. It's not nearly as sensitive to tariffs. And I would say, I think all of us recognize the environment is very fluid right now. So let me also just say for clarity sake, at the firmwide level, our RoTCE targets for 2026 are still 10% to 11%. The drivers behind them are the same, but the revenue mix might be different. We'll certainly know more as things get clearer as to how that plays out.",Jane Fraser,CEO,6,Q and A
"I think actually the other thing you mentioned about nationalization. Most of our clients have been clients for decades. I mean, a number of them have been clients for over a century. And it would not be British understatement to say that we are deeply embedded into them. I mean, it is extraordinary how deep we are. We've been on the ground for over a century, and we are viewed as quasi-local in most of these markets. Citi is not a bunch of suitcase bankers that fly in. We're not transactional. We're very unique in the footprint. And these factors do make us less vulnerable to the different geopolitical dynamics that are going on.",Jane Fraser,CEO,6,Q and A
OPERATOR: Our next question comes from the line of come from Jim Mitchell with Seaport Global. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.,OPERATOR,other,6,Q and A
"JIM MITCHELL: Hey good morning. Maybe Jane, just following up on that conversation, and you talked about leaning into, as being a port in the storm and leaning into it. So, I guess in the near term, are you seeing sort of demand already in terms of your balance sheet, whether it's raising liquidity and deposit flow like sort of flight to safety deposit flows and sort of the trading aspect of it from this volatility in April, have you sort of already seen greater demand from clients?",JIM MITCHELL,analyst,6,Q and A
"JANE FRASER: What I'd say about the clients at the moment, you're seeing deals still happening. We've done a number of them, as we've talked about, even over this last weekend, we were pretty busy, but I would say that most clients are pausing their plans. Now no one is taking bets in the market right now. We're seeing them prep for more headwinds. So, we're seeing some bolstering of already strong balance sheets. Remember, our client base aren't the smaller companies in the mid-market that are going to get more pummeled in this type of environment. So that our clients are getting ready. We're seeing some accelerating of imports to stockpile inventories. We are seeing a pausing on significant CapEx, while everyone waits to get clarity on the full agenda. And in that full agenda, remember, there's tax bill, there's deregulation actions. These are some positives that will be coming. It's a very big agenda. Clients appreciate it's going to take time. In terms of the trading side, what we're seeing is it is pretty orderly out there. There's a lot of complicated dynamics happening, but it's not being catalyzed by liquidity crisis or other things going on. Let's not fight the war, the last war. The issue we're tackling at the moment is something different. And we're seeing clients taking the opportunity to de-risk. We are, others are, so that if we have more turbulence ahead, everyone is in a stronger position for it, and that is a good thing. But it's early days, Jim. We've got to see how this unfolds.",Jane Fraser,CEO,6,Q and A
"JIM MITCHELL: Sure. No, I appreciate that color. And then maybe for Mark, I mean, you highlighted at least on a period-end basis, deposit growth and commercial loan growth looked pretty good on a period-end basis quarter-over-quarter. So, I guess when we think about the NII assumptions, deposit and loan growth looks good, but anything different given the strong start to the NII ex-Markets story and seemingly some good momentum in deposit and loan growth. Do you feel good, better, worse on sort of your NII outlook for this year?",JIM MITCHELL,analyst,6,Q and A
"MARK MASON: Yes. Thanks, Jim. Look, I continue to feel good about the NII outlook. There's obviously uncertainty that Jane has referenced, but that 2% to 3% ex-Markets. We've talked in the past about what the tailwinds and headwinds are. And you referenced, we saw some of that play through in the quarter in terms of deposit volumes. We saw a good operating momentum in our Services business in TTS in particular. The loan growth saw not just in average interest-earning balances on the Branded Cards side, but also saw trade loan growth as well. And so those are going to be important tailwinds as I think about the balance of the quarter. You've heard me reference as well, reinvestment from maturing securities in our investment portfolio into higher-yielding assets, including cash, and you can see that on the balance sheet that some of that started to take place as well in helping deposit spreads. And then the team has been very, very engaged as it relates to deposit repricing and managing beta through the current environment. So, the combination of those things, along with the removal of the reduction of late fees are really tailwinds that contribute to that 2% to 3% growth, and then there's some headwinds. So lower rates on floating rate assets would be a [headwind]. The potential of FX translation, primarily in Mexico would be a [headwind], but net-net, I feel good about the 2% to 3% growth in NII ex-Markets.",Mark Mason,CFO,7,Q and A
