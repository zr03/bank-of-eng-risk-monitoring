      "paragraph": "Thank you, Jenn, and good morning to everyone. Before I discuss the results of the quarter,\nlet me first address the regulatory actions by the Federal Reserve and the Office of the Comptroller of the\nCurrency which were announced on Wednesday. These actions pertain to the consent orders we entered\ninto with both agencies in 2020 and those orders covered four primary areas: risk management, data\ngovernance, controls and compliance. Addressing these areas is the primary goal of our Transformation,\nour number one priority. It is a multi-year effort to modernize our infrastructure, unify disparate tech\nmanagement. We have been public this year about the fact that we were behind in this particular area and\nthat we had increased our investment as a result. The regulatory actions consisted of two civil money\npenalties and, under the amended consent order with the OCC, a new process designed to ensure we are\nallocating sufficient resources to meet our remediation milestones, called the Resource Review Plan. We\nare currently developing the Plan for submission to the OCC.\nBy way of background, while the Federal Reserve is the primary regulator for Citigroup, our bank holding\ncompany, the OCC is the primary regulator for Citibank, N.A. or CBNA, which is our largest banking vehicle\nwith approximately 70% of our assets. The amended consent order with the OCC allows CBNA, to continue\npaying to Citigroup, at a minimum, the dividends necessary for debt service, preferred dividends, and other\nnon-discretionary obligations. While we are developing and seeking OCC consent for our Resource Review\n-objection. These dividends are\nintercompany payments that are made from CBNA ultimately to the parent, Citigroup. They should not be\nconfused with the common dividends Citigroup pays to its shareholders. Indeed, there is no restriction on\nk\nCopyright Â© 2024 Citigroup Inc. 1",

And let me be very clear, even with the investments needed for our Transformation, Citigroup has\nmore than sufficient resources to also invest in our businesses, and make the planned return of capital to\nour shareholders. We will increase our dividend from 53 to 56 cents a share, as we announced in late June,\nand will resume modest buybacks this quarter.\nWhile these actions were not entirely unexpected to us, it is no doubt disappointing for our investors and\nour people. We completely understand that. At the same time, we are confident in our ability to get these\nspecific areas where they need to be, as we have been able to do in other areas of the Transformation. And\nwe are pleased that it was acknowledged on Wednesday that we have made meaningful progress in\nexecuting our Transformation, and simplifying our firm. A multi-year undertaking such as this was never\ngoing to be linear. The investments we have been making are starting to come together to reduce risk,\nimprove controls and deliver tangible outcomes. The tech investments we have made are making a\ndifference. We have reduced the time it takes to book loans; automated controls for our traders to reduce\nerrors; moved risk analytics to a cloud-based infrastructure; and increased the resiliency of our platforms\nto reduce downtime. The changes to our organization and our culture are making a difference. We have\neliminated managerial constructs and layers whilst empowering our leaders. We introduced new tools to\nbetter manage human capital needs. Our focus on culture has increased accountability and attracted great\ncommitment that we will address any area of the consent order where we are behind by putting the\nnecessary resources and focus behind it. We will get this work where it needs to be, as we have with the\nexecution of our strategy and the simplification of our organization.\nNow, turning to what was another good quarter, our results show the relentless focus we have in executing\nour strategy as we continue to drive towards our medium-term return targets. We reported net income of\n$3.2 billion with an earnings per share of $1.52 and an ROTCE of 7.2%. Revenues were up 4% overall, as well\nas up in each of our five core businesses, where all but one had positive operating leverage. Expenses were\ndown 2% year-over-year. The steps we are taking to simplify our organization, right-size businesses such\nas Markets and Wealth, and reduce stranded costs are beginning to take hold, even as we increase\ninvestment in our Transformation. Over the medium term, we expect these simplification and stranded cost\nactions to drive the $2 to $2.5 billion in annual run-rate saves. Services grew 3% driven by solid fee growth,\nwhich we have prioritized. TTS saw increased activity in cross border payments and in commercial cards.\nSecurities Services was up 10%, with new client onboardings, deepening with existing clients, and market\nvaluations helping increase our assets under custody by a preliminary 9%. At our recent Services Investor\nDay, we very much enjoyed the opportunity to talk to you in-depth about how we are going to continue to\ngrow this high-returning business. And we are very pleased that people are starting to recognize why we\ndescribe it as our crown jewel.\nOverall, Markets had a strong finish to the quarter leading to better performance than we had anticipated.\nFixed Income was slightly down year-on-year due to lower FX and Rates, but we had good issuance and\nloan growth in Financing & Securitization, an area which generates attractive returns. Equities was up 37%,\ndriven by strong performance in derivatives which includes a gain on the Visa B exchange offer.\nBanking was up 38% as the wallet rebound gained some momentum and we again grew share. Our clients\ncontinued to access the debt capital markets with investment grade issuance near record levels. Equity\nissuance increased, particularly in convertibles, as companies wait for a fuller opening of the IPO window.\nInvestment Banking fees were up 63% versus the prior year. We have seen some healthy volumes\nassociated with announced deals year to date, particularly in Natural Resources and Technology.\nCombined with a strong pipeline, advisory activity looks promising as we think about the rest of the year\nand into next year.\nWealth is starting to improve. Growth in client investment assets drove stronger Investment revenue,\nespecially in Citigold, and was up a preliminary 15%. Our focus on rationalizing the expense base is starting\nCopyright Â© 2024 Citigroup Inc. 2",

      "paragraph": "Thanks, Jane and good morning, everyone. I am going to start with the firmwide financial\nresults, focusing on year-over-year comparisons for the second quarter unless I indicate otherwise, and then\nspend a little more time on the businesses.\nOn slide 6, we show financial results for the full firm. For the quarter, we reported net income of\napproximately $3.2 billion, EPS of $1.52 and an RoTCE of 7.2% on $20.1 billion of revenues. Total revenues\nwere up 4%, driven by growth across all businesses as well as an approximate $400 million gain related to\nthe Visa B exchange offer. A significant portion of this gain is reflected in Equity Markets, with the remainder\nreflected in All Other. Expenses were $13.4 billion, down 2%, and 6% on a sequential basis. The combination\nof revenue growth and expense decline drove positive operating leverage for the firm and the majority of our\nbusinesses. Cost of credit was $2.5 billion, primarily driven by higher Card net credit losses, which were\npartially offset by ACL releases in all businesses except USPB, where we built for loan growth. At the end of\nthe quarter, we had nearly $22 billion in total reserves with a reserve-to-funded loans ratio of approximately\n2.7%.\nOn slide 7, we show the expense trend over the past five quarters.

The decrease in expenses was primarily driven by savings associated\nwith our organizational simplification, stranded cost reductions, and lower repositioning costs, partially\noffset by continued investment in Transformation and the Fed and the OCC penalties. As we said over the\npast few months, we will continue to invest in the Transformation and technology to modernize our\noperations and risk and control infrastructure. We expect these investments to offset some of our saves and\nheadcount reduction going forward. However, based on what we now know today, we will likely be at the\nhigher end of the expense guidance range, excluding the FDIC special assessment and the civil money\npenalties. With that said, we will, of course, look for opportunities to absorb the CMP.\non the Transformation and address what the Fed and OCC announced Wednesday. We have made good\nprogress on our Transformation in certain areas over the last few years, and I want to highlight some of those\nareas before discussing the announcement. First, Wholesale Credit and Loan operations, where we\nimplemented a consistent end to end operating model and consolidated multiple systems with enhanced\ntechnology. This has not only reduced risk but enhanced operating efficiency and the client experience. We\nhave also made improvements in risk and compliance as we enhanced our risk assessments and technology\ncapabilities to increase automation for monitoring. And in Data, while there is a lot more to do, we have\nstood up a data governance process and streamlined our data architecture to ultimately facilitate straight\nthrough processing. Overall, we have improved risk management, and consolidated and upgraded systems\nand platforms to improve our resiliency. These efforts represent meaningful examples of how we are making\nprogress against our Transformation milestones. That said, we have fallen short in data quality management\nparticularly related to regulatory reporting, which we have acknowledged publicly since the beginning of the\nyear. As such, we have begun to put additional investments and resources in place to not only address data\nquality management related to regulatory reporting and data governance, but also related to stress testing\ncapabilities, including DFAST and Resolution Recovery. We also re-prioritized our efforts to ensure we are\nfocused on data that impacts these reports first. We take this feedback from our regulators very seriously\nand we are committed to allocating all the resources necessary to meet their expectations.\nNow turning back to the quarterly results. On slide 9, we show net interest income, deposits, and loans where\nIn the second quarter, net interest income was roughly flat. Excluding\nMarkets, net interest income was down 3%, largely driven by the impact of foreign exchange translation,\nseasonally lower revolving card balances and lower interest rates in Argentina, partially offset by higher\ndeposit spreads in Wealth. Average loans were roughly flat, as growth in Cards and Mexico Consumer was\nlargely offset by slight declines across businesses. And average deposits decreased by 1%, largely driven by\nseasonal outflows and transfers to investments in Wealth as well as non-operational outflows in TTS.\nOn slide 10, we show key consumer and corporate credit metrics, which reflect our disciplined risk appetite\nframework. Across our card portfolios, approximately 86% of our card loans are to consumers with FICO\nscores of 660 or higher. And while we continue to see an overall resilient US consumer, we also continue to\nsee a divergence in performance and behavior across FICO and income bands. When we look across our\nconsumer clients, only the highest income quartile has more savings than they did at the beginning of 2019.\nAnd it is the over 740 FICO customers that are driving the spend growth and maintaining high payment rates.\nLower FICO band customers are seeing sharper drops in payment rates and borrowing more as they are more\nacutely impacted by high inflation and interest rates. That said, as we will discuss later, we are seeing signs\nof stabilization in delinquency performance across our cards portfolios. And we have taken this all into\naccount in our reserving and we remain well reserved with a reserve-to-funded loan ratio of 8.1% for our total\ncard portfolio. Our Corporate portfolio is largely investment grade, at approximately 82% as of the second\nquarter. And we saw a nearly $500 million sequential decrease in corporate non-accrual loans, largely driven\nby upgrades and repayments. Additionally, this quarter we saw an improvement in our macro assumptions\ndriven by HPI, oil prices and equity market valuations. And our credit loss reserves continue to incorporate a\nscenario-weighted average unemployment rate of nearly 5%, and a downside scenario unemployment rate\nof nearly 7%. As such, we feel very comfortable with the nearly $22 billion of reserves that we have in the\ncurrent environment.\nCopyright Â© 2024 Citigroup Inc. 4",

It is this strength that allows us to support clients through periods of uncertainty and volatility. Our\nbalance sheet is a reflection of our risk appetite, strategy and diversified business model. Our $1.3 trillion\ndeposit base is well diversified across regions, industries, customers and account types. The majority of our\ndeposits are corporate, at $807 billion, and span 90 countries. And as you heard at the Services ID, most of\nthese deposits are held in operating accounts that are crucial to how our clients fund their daily operations\naround the world, making them operational in nature and therefore very stable. The majority of our\nremaining deposits, about $404 billion, are well diversified across the Private Bank, Citigold, Retail and\nWealth at Work offerings, as well as across regions and products. Of our total deposits, 68% are US dollar\ndenominated with the remainder spanning over 60 currencies. Our asset mix also reflects our strong risk\nappetite framework. Our $688 billion loan portfolio is well diversified across consumer and corporate loans.\nAnd about one-third of our balance sheet is held in cash and high-quality, short duration investment\nsecurities that contribute to our approximately $900 billion of available liquidity resources. We continue to\nfeel very good about the strength of our balance sheet and the quality of our assets and liabilities, which\nposition us to be a source of strength for the industry and, importantly, for our clients.\nOn slide 12, we show a sequential walk to provide more detail on the drivers of our CET1 ratio this quarter.\nWe ended the quarter with a preliminary 13.6% CET1 capital ratio, approximately 130 basis points, or\napproximately $15 billion, above our current regulatory capital requirement of 12.3%. We expect our\nregulatory capital requirement to decrease to 12.1% as of October 1st, which incorporates the reduction in\nour Stress Capital Buffer from 4.3% to the indicative SCB of 4.1% we announced a couple weeks ago. We\nwere pleased to see the improvement in our DFAST results, and the corresponding reduction in our SCB. That\nsaid, even with the reduction, our capital requirement does not yet fully reflect our simplification efforts, the\nbenefits of our transformation or the full execution of our strategy, all of which we expect to reduce our\ncapital requirements over time. And as a reminder, we announced an increase to our common dividend from\n$0.53 per share to $0.56 per share following the SCB results. And as Jane mentioned earlier, we plan on\ndoing $1 billion of buybacks this quarter.\nSo now turning to slide 13. Before I get into the businesses, as a reminder, in the fourth quarter of last year,\nwe implemented a revenue sharing arrangement within Banking, and between Banking, Services and\nMarkets to reflect the benefit the businesses get from our relationship-based lending. The impact of revenue\nrvices, revenues\nwere up 3% this quarter, reflecting continued underlying momentum across both TTS and Securities\nServices. Net interest income was down 1%, largely driven by lower earnings on our net investment in\nArgentina, partially offset by the benefit of higher U.S. and Non-US interest rates relative to the prior-year\nperiod. Non-interest revenue increased 11%, driven by continued strength across underlying fee drivers, as\nwell as a smaller impact from currency devaluation in Argentina. The underlying growth in both businesses\nis a result of our continued investments in product innovation, client experience and platform modernization\nthat we highlighted during our Services Investor Day last month. Expenses increased 9%, largely driven by\nan Argentina-related transaction tax expense, a legal settlement expense and continued investments in\nproduct innovation and technology. Cost of credit was a benefit of $27 million, driven by an ACL release in\nthe quarter. Average loans were up 3%, primarily driven by continued demand for export and agency finance,\nparticularly in Asia, as well as working capital loans to corporate and commercial clients in Latin America and\nAsia. Average deposits were down 1%, driven by non-operating deposit outflows. At the same time, we\ncontinue to see good operating deposit inflows. Net income was approximately $1.5 billion. And Services\ncontinues to deliver a high RoTCE, coming in at 23.8% for the quarter.\nOn slide 14, we show the results for Markets for the second quarter. Markets revenues were up 6%. Fixed\nIncome revenues decreased 3%, driven by Rates and Currencies, which were down 11% on the back of lower\nvolatility and tighter spreads. This was partially offset by strength in Spread Products and Other Fixed\nIncome, which was up 20% primarily driven by continued loan growth and higher securitization and\nunderwriting fees. In addition to a benefit from the Visa B exchange offer, we continued to see good\nunderlying momentum in Equities, primarily driven by Equity Derivatives. And we continued to make\nprogress in prime with balances up approximately 18%. Expenses decreased 1%, driven by productivity\nCopyright Â© 2024 Citigroup Inc. 5",

Cost of credit was a benefit of $11 million, as an\nACL release more than offset net credit losses. Average loans increased 11%, largely driven by asset-backed\nlending in Spread Products. Average trading assets increased 12%, largely driven by client demand for\nTreasuries and mortgage-backed securities. Markets generated positive operating leverage and delivered\nnet income of approximately $1.4 billion with an RoTCE of 10.7% for the quarter.\nOn slide 15, we show the results for Banking for the second quarter. Banking revenues increased 38%, driven\nby growth in Investment banking and Corporate Lending. Investment Banking revenues increased 60%,\ndriven by strength across Capital Markets and Advisory, given favorable market conditions. DCM continued\nto benefit from strong issuance activity, mainly in Investment Grade, as issuers continued to de-risk funding\nplans in advance of what could be a more volatile second half in the context of a number of important global\nelections as well as the macro environment. In ECM, excluding China A-\nactivity, led by the US, as well as continued convertible issuance, as issuers take advantage of strong equity\nmarket performance and expectations for rates to be higher for longer. And in Advisory, we are seeing\nrevenues from the relatively low announced activity in 2023 coming to fruition as those transactions close.\nBoth year-to-date and in the quarter, we gained share across DCM, ECM and Advisory, particularly in\nCorporate Lending revenues, excluding mark-to-market on loan\nhedges, increased 7%, largely driven by higher revenue share. We generated positive operating leverage again\nthis quarter as expenses decreased 10%, primarily driven by actions taken to right size the expense base.\nCost of credit was a benefit of $32 million, driven by an ACL release reflecting an improvement in the\nmacroeconomic outlook, partially offset by net credit losses. Average loans decreased 4% as we maintained\nstrict discipline around returns combined with lower overall demand for credit. Net income was $406 million\nand RoTCE was 7.5% for the quarter.\nOn slide 16, we show the results for Wealth for the second quarter. Wealth revenues increased 2%, driven by\na 13% increase in NIR from higher investment fee revenues, partially offset by a 4% decrease in NII from\nhigher mortgage funding costs. We continue to see good momentum in non-interest revenue as we\nbenefited from double-digit client investment asset growth, both in North America and internationally,\ndriven by net new client investment assets as well as market valuations. Expenses were down 4%, driven by\nthe initial benefits of expense reductions as we right size the workforce and expense base. Cost of credit was\na benefit of $9 million, as an ACL release more than offset net credit losses. Preliminary end-of-period client\nbalances increased 9%, driven by higher client investment assets as well as higher deposits. Average loans\nwere flat, as we continued to optimize capital usage. Average deposits increased 2%, largely reflecting the\ntransfer of relationships and the associated deposits from USPB, partially offset by a shift in deposits to\nhigher- Client investment assets were up 15%, driven by net new\ninvestment asset flows and the benefit of higher market valuations. Wealth generated positive operating\nleverage this quarter and delivered Net income of $210 million with an RoTCE of 6.4% for the quarter.\nOn slide 17, we show the results for US Personal Banking for the second quarter. US Personal Banking\nrevenues increased 6%, driven by NII growth of 5% and lower partner payments. Branded Cards revenues\nincreased 8%, driven by interest-earning balance growth of 9% as payment rates continue to moderate. And\nwe continue to see growth in spend volumes up 3%, primarily driven by customers with FICO scores of 740\nor higher. Retail Services revenues increased 6%, primarily driven by lower payments from Citi to our partners\ndue to higher net credit losses. And interest-earning balances grew 8%. Retail Banking revenues increased\n3%, driven by higher deposit spreads, as well as mortgage and installment loan growth. USPB also generated\npositive operating leverage this quarter, with expenses down 2%, driven by lower technology and\ncompensation costs, partially offset by higher volume-related expenses. Cost of credit increased to $2.3\nbillion, largely driven by higher NCLs of $1.9 billion and an ACL build of approximately $400 million reflecting\nvolume growth in the quarter. But let me remind you of the three things driving our NCLs this quarter. First,\ncard loan vintages that were originated over the last few years are all maturing at the same time. These\nvintages were delayed in their maturation due to the unprecedented levels of government stimulus during\nthe pandemic. Second, we continue to see seasonally higher NCLs in the second quarter. Third, certain\npockets of customers continue to be impacted by persistent inflation and high interest rates resulting in\nhigher losses. However, across both portfolios we are seeing signs of stabilization in delinquency\nCopyright Â© 2024 Citigroup Inc. 6",

We've been very focused on ensuring\nthat acquisitions that we've made have been appropriately kind of analyzed in the underwriting of that to get\ncomfortable with the quality of new customers that we've been bringing on. In light of the environment, we\nhave looked at moving towards higher FICO scores for new account acquisitions. But as I think about what\nwe're seeing now, there is that dichotomy that I mentioned where we have the higher FICO score customers\nthat are driving the spend growth and that frankly have still continued strong balances and savings and it's\nreally the lower FICO band customers, where we're seeing the sharper drop in payment rates and more\nborrowing. And so, the FICO inflation has effectively kind of fizzled out when we look at the mix and dynamic\nof the customer portfolio that we have at this point.\nAnd in terms of the CFPB late fees, well, I don't have an update on that. Like I said, we've built in an\nassumption in our forecast. But in terms of the timing, I don't have a formal update on the certainty of it.",

And so we still think there's some upside from a reinvestment point of view.\nThe point you make around kind of non-US dollar or US rates kind of coming off, that'll play through a little\nbit as we think about the beta increases that we're expecting outside of the US. And so, we've assumed that\nwe have higher betas pick up outside of the US. If rates kind of come off in a more substantive way, then we\ncould see kind of a little less NII pressure than we're forecasting there. But net-net, as I think about the\ncombination of volume growth that we're expecting between loans and deposits over that medium term, the\nhigher yield we can earn on our assets, combined with the pricing capabilities that we have across the\nportfolio, offsetting some of that beta, we believe we'll have continued NII growth.\nCopyright Â© 2024 Citigroup Inc. 11",

As\nwe've said, we'll have about $1.5 billion in savings related to the restructuring that we've done and another\n$500 million to $1 billion related to net expense reductions from eliminating the stranded costs as well as\nadditional productivity over that medium-term period.

We've had a number of quarters of good revenue growth. And as\nMark said, we're at the low point of the credit cycle and we knew this year, we would see the pressure on\nreturns from the elevated NCLs and some of the industry headwinds we've talked about. But as the NCL rates\napproach steady state levels and the mitigating actions that all of us have been putting in place against the\nindustry headwinds, as those take hold, we expect the returns will improve and support the firm-wide\nmedium-term targets.\nIn the Retail Bank, we're continuing to focus on growing share in our six core markets and we're doing that,\nleveraging our physical and digital assets. It plays an important role in enabling the wealth continuum and\nthe growth that we're looking at in our Wealth franchise. We're continuing to improve our operating\nefficiency, being very disciplined in expense management and managing carefully the branch and digital\nproductivity of the Retail Bank network. But we're at the high point of the credit cycle. It's driving the low\npoint for USPB, and as I said in my remarks, we're expecting to see those returns improve from here.",

It roughly equates to about 10% of\nyour market cap. And the good news here, I suppose, is that it should come back into capital over time, but\nwe've seen very little utilization over the past two years despite the firm being profitable.

Our\ncorporate clients, as you heard about at our Services Investor Day, access account data real-time across\nmultiple countries on CitiDirect. And we're moving $5 trillion roughly per day for those clients around the\nworld. We trade billions of dollars in a millisecond on our trading platforms.

What it is doing is simplifying how data moves through the firm\nand it's about upgrading the management and governance over those flows. And as I've said, we're doing a\nstrategic overhaul of large parts of our infrastructure, so what are we doing?\nWe're making sure we're capturing data accurately using smart tools and automation. We'll often talk about\nthis smart system, makes sure there's no errors when we book a trade. We've seen our error rate down 85%\nas a result of it. We're housing our upstream data in two standardized repositories, they're the golden\nsources, an in-person data hub which you've heard me talk about a few times and they're a golden source\nnow for all of the downstream data use, populating the thousands of regulatory reports Mark talked about\nand other areas. And what a single repository means is that the data models, the data quality rules, the\ncontrols you put in place that govern and manage that data, they all sit in one place rather than being\ndistributed all over the firm as they have been historically.\nMark's been investing in building a standardized reporting infrastructure. You've heard us talk about a single\nfull suite reporting ledger versus the six or so reporting ledgers that we had in the past.
