Today I am going to touch on the\nmacroeco\nquarter.\nWhile global economic performance was surprisingly desynchronized last year, the overall story has been\nconsistent of late: one of economic resiliency supported by tight labor markets and the consumer. Growth\nthis year looks poised to slow in many markets. And conditions are generally disinflationary - you are\nalready seeing some central banks in the emerging markets starting to cut rates.\nIn the U.S., a soft landing is viewed as increasingly likely. But we continue to see a tale of two Europes with\nGermany hurt by the weak demand for goods while southern European countries such as Spain and Greece\nbenefit from stronger demand in services.\nIn Asia,\nalthough its property market remains a concern.\nAmidst all these dynamics, we continue to focus on executing against our strategy and delivering the best\nof Citi to all our stakeholders. I said 2024 will be a pivotal year for us as we put our business and\norganizational simplification largely behind us and we focus on two main priorities: the Transformation and\nthe performance of our businesses and the firm.\nCopyright Â© 2024 Citigroup Inc. 1",

      "paragraph": "T R A N S C R I P T\nCiti First Quarter 2024 Earnings Call\nApril 12, 2024\nLast month marked the end to the organizational simplification we announced in September. The result is\na cleaner, simpler management structure that fully aligns to and facilitates our strategy. We are now more\nclient-centric\nclear lines of accountability, starting with my management team, fewer layers, increased spans of control,\nand frankly much less bureaucracy and needless complexity.\nThis will all help us run the company more efficiently, it will enhance our client experience, and improve\nmore roles were ultimately impacted than the 5,000 we discussed in January.\nWe also took a number of other steps to sharpen our business focus and improve returns by right placing\nstrategy; and right sizing the workforce in Wealth.\nAs a result of all these combined steps, which include the simplification, we are eliminating approximately\n7,000 positions which will generate $1.5 billion of annualized run-rate expense saves. The combination of\nthese actions and the measures we are taking to eliminate our remaining stranded costs will drive $2 to\n$2.5 billion in cumulative annualized run-rate saves in the medium term.\nWe are keeping a close eye on the execution of these efforts and overall resourcing to ensure we safeguard\nour commitment to the Transformation. As you know, given its magnitude and scale, the Transformation\nis a multi-year effort to address issues that have spanned over two decades.\nWe have made steady progress as we retire multiple legacy platforms, streamline end-to-end processes,\nand strengthen our risk and control environment. All of which are necessary, not only to meet the\nexpectations of our regulators, but also to serve our clients more effectively.\nA transformation of this magnitude is never linear. So while we have made good progress in many areas,\nthere are a few where we are intensifying our efforts, such as automating certain regulatory processes and\nthe data related to regulatory reporting. We are committed to getting these right and will look to self-fund\nthe necessary investments to do so.\nTurning to the quarter, we had a good start to a pivotal year. We reported net income of approximately $3.4\nbillion, EPS of $1.58 and an RoTCE of 7.6% on over $21 billion of revenues. Our revenues were up over 3%\nyear-over-year, excluding divestitures, which was primarily the billion-dollar gain from the India consumer\nsale last year. Our expenses were slightly down quarter-over-quarter, excluding the FDIC special\nassessments.\nServices continues to perform well and generate very attractive returns. Revenue was up 8% for the quarter\nas both businesses won new mandates and deepened relationships with existing clients.\nFees were up a pleasing 10% for Services year over year, driven by the investments we have made across\nour product offering, platforms and client experience. In Securities Services, we took share again this\nquarter. And in TTS, cross-border activity continued to outpace global GDP growth, and commercial card\nspend remained robust. We look forward to diving deeper into these two businesses at our Investor\nPresentation on Services in June.\nimpacted Rates and Currencies, that was off a very strong first quarter last year. We saw good client activity\nin Equities and in Spread Products, where both new issuance and securitization activity were particularly\nrobust. We fully integrated our Financing and Securitization capabilities within our Markets business and\nwe started to see the benefits of having a unified spread product offering for our clients.\nCopyright Â© 2024 Citigroup Inc. 2",

      "paragraph": "T R A N S C R I P T\nCiti First Quarter 2024 Earnings Call\nApril 12, 2024\nOn slide 6, we show financial results for the full firm. In the first quarter, we reported net income of\napproximately $3.4 billion, EPS of $1.58 and an RoTCE of 7.6% on $21.1 billion of revenues. Total revenues\nwere down 2% on a reported basis. Excluding divestiture-related impacts, largely consisting of the $1 billion\ngain from the sale of the India consumer business in the prior year, revenues were up more than 3%, driven\nby growth across Banking, USPB and Services, partially offset by declines in Markets and Wealth. Expenses\nwere $14.2 billion, up 7%, on a reported basis. Excluding divestiture-related impacts and the incremental\nFDIC special assessment, expenses were up 5%. Cost of credit was approximately $2.4 billion, primarily\ndriven by higher Card net credit losses, which were partially offset by ACL releases in Wealth, Banking and\nLegacy Franchises. At the end of the quarter, we had nearly $22 billion in total reserves with a reserve-to-\nfunded loans ratio of approximately 2.8%.\nOn slide 7, we show the expense trend over the past five quarters. We reported expenses of $14.2 billion,\nwhich included the incremental FDIC special assessment of roughly $250 million. Also included in this\nnumber are $225 million of restructuring charges largely related to the organizational simplification. In total,\nactions, we expect approximately $1.5 billion of annualized run-rate saves over the medium term related to\na headcount reduction of approximately 7,000. In addition to the restructuring, we took approximately $260\nmillion of repositioning costs largely related to our efficiency efforts across the firm, including the reduction\nof stranded costs associated with the consumer divestitures. The expected savings from these actions will\nallow us to continue to fund additional investments in the Transformation this year. And relative to the prior\nyear, the remainder of the expense growth was largely driven by inflation and volume-related expenses,\npartially offset by productivity savings. In the remainder of the year, we expect a more normalized level of\nrepositioning, which is already embedded in our guidance. Therefore, you can expect our quarterly expense\ntrend to go down from here in line with our $53.5-$53.8 billion ex-FDIC expense guidance.\nOn slide 8, we show net interest income, deposits, and loans, sequential variances. In the\nfirst quarter, net interest income decreased by $317 million, largely driven by Markets, which resulted in a 4\nbasis point decrease in net interest margin. Excluding Markets, net interest income was relatively flat.\nAverage loans were up $4 billion, primarily driven by Loans in Spread Products in Markets, as well as Card\nand Mortgage loans in US Personal Banking, partially offset by declines in Services. And average deposits\nwere up nearly $7 billion, primarily driven by Services, as we continue to grow high-quality operating\ndeposits.\nOn slide 9, we show key consumer and corporate credit metrics. This quarter, we adjusted our FICO\ndistribution to be more aligned with industry reporting practices and now show our FICO mix using a 660\nthreshold. Across Branded Cards and Retail Services, approximately 85% of our card loans are to consumers\nwith FICO scores of 660 or higher. And we remain well reserved with a reserve-to-funded loan ratio of 8.2%\nfor our total card portfolio. In our Corporate portfolio, the majority of our exposure is investment grade,\nwhich is reflected in our low level of non-accrual loans at 0.5% of total corporate loans. As a reminder, our\nloan loss reserves incorporate a scenario-weighted average unemployment rate of approximately 5%, which\nincludes a downside scenario unemployment rate of close to 7%. As such, we feel very comfortable with the\nnearly $22 billion of reserves we have in the current environment.\nhighlight the strength of our balance sheet, capital and\nliquidity. We maintain a very strong $2.4 trillion high-quality balance sheet, which increased 1% sequentially.\nDespite this increase, we were able to decrease our risk-weighted assets reflecting our continued\noptimization efforts and focus on capital efficiency. Our balance sheet is a reflection of our risk appetite,\nstrategy and diversified business model. The foundation of our funding is a $1.3 trillion deposit base, which\nis well diversified across regions, industries, customers and account types. The majority of our deposits,\n$812 billion, are corporate and span 90 countries. Most of our corporate deposits reside in operating\naccounts that are crucial to how our clients fund their daily operations around the world. In most cases, we\nintegrated services payments & collections, liquidity management and working capital solutions. All of\nwhich greatly increase the stickiness of these deposits. The majority of our remaining deposits, about $423\nCopyright Â© 2024 Citigroup Inc. 4",

Now turning to the asset side, over the last several years, we have maintained a strong\nrisk appetite framework and have been very deliberate about how we deploy our deposits and other liabilities\ninto high-quality assets. This starts with our $675 billion loan portfolio which is well diversified across\nconsumer and corporate loans. And the duration of the total portfolio is approximately 1.2 years. About one-\nthird of our balance sheet is held in cash and high-quality, short-duration investment securities that\ncontribute to our nearly $1 trillion of available liquidity resources. And for the quarter, we had an LCR of 117%.\nSo to wrap it up, we are active and deliberate in the management of our balance sheet, which is reflected in\nour high-quality assets and strong capital and liquidity position.\nOn slide 11, we show the sequential CET1 walk to provide more detail on the drivers this quarter. First, we\ngenerated $3.1 billion of net income to common shareholders, which added 27 basis points. Second, we\nreturned $1.5 billion in the form of common dividends and share repurchases, which drove a reduction of\nabout 13 basis points. Third, we saw an increase in our disallowed DTA, which resulted in a 10 basis point\ndecrease. And finally, the remaining 6 basis point benefit was largely driven by a reduction in RWA. We ended\nthe quarter with a preliminary 13.5% CET1 capital ratio, approximately 120 basis points, or over $13 billion,\nabove our regulatory capital requirement of 12.3%. That said, our capital requirement does not yet reflect our\nsimplification efforts, the benefits of our Transformation or the full execution of our strategy, all of which we\nexpect to bring down capital requirements over time.\nSo now turning to slide 12. Before I get into the businesses, let me remind you that in the fourth quarter, we\nimplemented a revenue sharing arrangement within Banking, and between Banking, Services and Markets\nto reflect the benefit the businesses get from our relationship-based lending. The impact of revenue sharing\nis in In Services, revenues were\nup 8% this quarter, driven by continued momentum across both TTS and Securities Services. Net interest\nincome increased 6%, driven by higher deposit and trade loan spreads. Non-interest revenue increased 14%,\nlargely driven by continued strength across underlying fee drivers. In TTS, cross-border volumes increased\n9%, USD clearing volumes increased 3% and commercial card spend volumes increased 5%, all of which was\ndriven by strong corporate client activity. In Securities Services, our preliminary assets under custody and\nadministration increased 11%, benefiting from higher market valuations, as well as new client onboarding.\nThe growth in both businesses is a direct result of our continued investments in product innovation, the\nclient experience and platform modernization to gain share across all client segments. TTS continues to\nmaintain its number one position with Large Corporate and FI clients and see good momentum in the\ncommercial client segment. And we continue to gain share in Securities Services. Expenses increased 11%,\nlargely driven by continued investments in technology and product innovation. Cost of credit was $64\nmillion as net credit losses remain low. Net income was approximately $1.5 billion. Average loans were up\n4%, primarily driven by strong demand for working capital loans in TTS. Average deposits were down 3% as\nthe impact of quantitative tightening more than offset new client acquisitions and deepening with existing\nclients. However, it is worth noting that we continue to see good operating deposit inflow. And Services\ncontinues to deliver a high RoTCE of 24.1% for the quarter.\nOn slide 13, we show the results for Markets for the first quarter. Markets revenues were down 7% as lower\nFixed Income revenues more than offset growth in Equities. Fixed Income revenues decreased 10%, driven\nby Rates and Currencies, which were down 21%, on the back of lower volatility and a strong quarter in the\nprior year. This was partially offset by strength in Spread Products and Other Fixed Income, which was up\n26% driven by an increase in client activity, particularly in asset-backed lending. And we continued to see\ngood underlying momentum in Equities, with revenues up 5%, driven by growth across cash trading and\nequity derivatives. And we continued to make progress in prime with balances up more than 10%. Expenses\nincreased 7%, largely driven by the absence of a legal reserve release last year. Cost of credit was $200\nmillion, primarily driven by macroeconomic assumptions related to loans in Spread Products that impacted\nreserves. Net income was approximately $1.4 billion. Average loans increased 8%, primarily driven by asset-\nbacked lending in Spread Products due to an improvement in market activity. Average trading assets\nincreased 4% sequentially, largely driven by seasonally stronger activity in the first quarter. Markets\ndelivered an RoTCE of 10.4% for the quarter.\nCopyright Â© 2024 Citigroup Inc. 5",

Banking revenues increased 49%, driven by\ngrowth in Investment banking and Corporate Lending and lower losses on loan hedges. As I previously\nmentioned, Corporate Lending results include the impact of revenue sharing from Investment Banking,\nServices and Markets. Investment Banking revenues increased 35%, driven by DCM and ECM as improved\nmarket sentiment led to an increase in issuance activity, particularly Investment Grade, which is running at\nnear-record levels.

The NCL rate was 0.3% of average loans, and we ended the quarter with a reserve-to-funded\nloan ratio of 1.5%. Net income was approximately $536 million. Average loans decreased 6% as we\nmaintained strict discipline around capital efficiency, as we optimize Corporate loan balances.

As Jane mentioned, this will take time but over the medium to longer-term, we view\nthis as a greater- than-20% return business.\nOn slide 16, we show the results for US Personal Banking for the first quarter. US Personal Banking revenues\nincreased 10%, driven by NII growth of 8% and lower partner payments. Branded Cards revenues increased\n7%, driven by interest-earning balance growth of 10% as payment rates continue to moderate. And we\ncontinue to see healthy growth in spend volumes up 4%, primarily driven by our more affluent customers.\nRetail Services revenues increased 18%, primarily driven by lower partner payments due to higher net credit\nlosses, as well as interest-earning balance growth of 9%. Retail Banking revenues increased 1%, driven by\nhigher deposit spreads, loan growth and improved mortgage margins.

Cost of credit\nof approximately $2.2 billion increased 34%, largely driven by higher NCLs of $1.9 billion as card loan\nvintages that were originated over the last few years were delayed in their maturation due to the\nunprecedented levels of government stimulus during the pandemic and are now maturing. In Branded\nCards, the NCL rate came in at 3.65%, in line with our expectations. In Retail Services, the NCL rate of 6.32%\nwas slightly above the high end of our guidance range for the full year and will likely remain above the range\nin the second quarter, reflecting historical seasonality patterns. However, given the persistent inflation,\nhigher interest rates and continued sales pressure at our partners, we now expect to be closer to the high\nend of the full year NCL guidance range for Retail Services. This expectation, along with the continued mix\nshift from transactors to revolvers across both portfolios, led to an ACL build of approximately $340 million.\nNet income decreased to $347 million. Average deposits decreased 10%, as the transfer of relationships and\nthe associated deposits to our Wealth business more than offset the underlying growth.

      "paragraph": "Thank you, Mike, for the question. The simplification that we've just gone through, it is what\nwe said it is. It is the most consequential set of changes, not only to the organization model that we have but\nhow we run the bank. It's aligned the structure with the strategy. It's simplified the bank. It's eliminated\nneedless complexity. It's created greater transparency into the five businesses and their performance as you\ncan see. It's increased accountability. And very simply, it's just easier for our people to focus on our clients,\nbut also getting things done and the execution that we have ahead of us.\nSo maybe if I try and bring this a bit more alive, the first thing we did was we elevated the five businesses and\nthat eliminated the ICG and PBWM layer, and we brought all the elements that the businesses needed to run\nend-to-end under the direct management of those five business heads, an example being operations. It's\nenabled transparency, greater accountability, and this end-to-end and total P&L focus, so focus on the\nbottom line and the returns driving growth, expense discipline, etcetera.\nWe also right-placed businesses to align with the strategy, so Banking all being under one umbrella, the\nInvestment Bank, the Corporate Bank, Commercial Bank, really helping us drive synergies there. Putting F&S\nand Securitization into Markets, so that we have a unified spread product there, also beginning to see the\nbenefits of that this quarter.\nSo that's an example in the businesses, but I do want to highlight a couple of other areas around this change.\nCopyright Â© 2024 Citigroup Inc. 7",

And, yes, it\nwas a different rate environment, but that growth that we delivered over the past couple of years has been a\nmix of both revenue and underlying business strength.\nAs you think about the guidance we talked about for this year, we talked about the NII ex-Markets being\ndown modestly. And so what that means is that the momentum and the growth that we expect is going to\ncome from the non-interest revenue. And I think this quarter is a good example of where and how that's likely\nto play through, so the revenue top line being up 3-plus percent, but when you look through each of the\nbusinesses, and if you look on each of the pages where we disclose the revenue, you can see the underlying\nNIR growth in the bottom left hand corner of each of those pages, that's coming through as well. So Services\nup 14% with growth in both TTS, between cross-border, clearing, commercial cards, but also and Securities\nServices, right, with the growth that we're seeing from continued momentum in assets under custody. We\nexpect that trend to continue with existing clients and new clients as well as how we do more with our\ncommercial market commercial middle market business, excuse me. So NIR growth there.\nThe Investment Banking piece is the other driver of fees. We're seeing that wallet start to rebound. We're part\nof that rebound. The announced transactions, we're part of those in sectors that we've been investing in.\nWe're bringing in new talent to help us realize and experience that.\nAnd even in Wealth, where we're not pleased with the top line performance this quarter of down 4%. When\nyou look through that, we do have good underlying NIR1 growth in the quarter in Wealth and that's up 11%\nyear-over-year and it's in the area that Andy and the team is leaning in on which is investments and not just\nin one region, but across all the regions.\nAnd then finally, the USPB piece which is showing good NIR1 growth as well, so the long and short of it is that\nthe 4% growth that's implied in $80 billion to $81 billion is going to be continued momentum, largely in fees,\nhelping us to deliver for our clients and make continued progress towards that medium-term target.",

So, to that end, I guess I'm going to ask Ebrahim's question differently, and then ask\na question about card late fees.\nHow are you balancing clearly, your valuation would demand that the buybacks be ramped up from $500\nmillion. But growing revenues at a 4% to 5% CAGR would mean potentially some capital plowed back into\nthe business. I guess how are you balancing that, especially given that the demand for buyback is louder at\nCiti than any other money center peer?

So, we have set some medium-term targets. Obviously,\nJane has recasted the vision and the strategy. I think we're making very good progress against that, but we're\nplaying for the long-term. And what that means is that we have to continue to invest in the franchise.\nIt's why I've given you a range around the expenses, at least in part. It's why I've continued to stress the\nimportance of protecting the Transformation and risk and control spend. And it's why I started the answer\nto Ebrahim's question by saying that we want to be sure that we can match the client demand out there,\nwhere the returns to do so makes sense. And so, we are having to balance kind of the use of capital and other\nresources against that longer term strategic objective and utilize it where it makes sense and generates good\nreturns against the idea of returning that to shareholders.\nAnd so, we'll continue to do that. It's an everyday assessment. It's an everyday discussion with the teams.\nFrankly, it's why things like the revenue sharing has been put in place to intensify the discussion around the\nclients that we're using balance sheet with and ensuring that we're driving broader revenues across the\nplatform. And so, that's kind of how we're operating in terms of making that trade-off on a regular basis, in\naddition to obviously the broader regulatory environment that we're in.\nIn terms of the second part of your question around late fees, we haven't disclosed kind of the dollar amount\nof the late fees. What I would say is that we did and have factored that into the $80 billion to $81 billion. And\nthe only thing I'd add to that is it did kind of it's being implemented a bit earlier than what we had assumed.\nBut again, it's inside of the range of the guidance that I've given you for top line revenue for the year.",

      "paragraph": "Yeah. Thanks, John. We have obviously continued to manage this portfolio very actively.\nWe've seen continued top line growth. We've seen continued average interest-earning balance growth. We've\ntalked about how we expect for the cost of credit to normalize, and we've seen that continue to happen. The\nrange that we've given on Branded Cards, we're inside of that range. When you look at the spend across the\nportfolios, the spend is really happening with the affluent customers more so than anything else. And so,\nwe're watching the lower income customer profile or customers that we have. But again, as Jane\nmentioned, we tend to skew to the higher end to begin with.\nWhere we're really seeing the pressure is where I mentioned in terms of Retail Services. And so, there, the\ncurrent NCLs are higher than the high-end of the full year range that I've given. But if you look back, that is\nnot inconsistent with seasonality that we've seen in the past in that portfolio, where the first two quarters\nare higher than the back half of the year, in part because of coming out of the holiday season and how losses\ntend to mature or materialize through that process.\nAnd so, I'd expect to not only see them be higher than the average range in Q1, but also in Q2 before coming\ndown. And then, I still expect that in 2025, you tend to see them further normalize and come down a bit off\nof these ranges. But look, the reality is that we continue to watch it, and the factors that are out there that\nare important include how unemployment evolves, what happens with inflation, what happens with interest\nrates, and those will be important factors as to how the loss rates continue to evolve over time.\nI think the final point I'd make and I mentioned it in the prepared remarks is that we have to remember that\nthe loss rates in both portfolios reflect kind of multiple vintages maturing at the same time. And you'll recall,\nand this is an industry dynamic, through the COVID pandemic period, losses were at an all-time low,\npayment rates at all-time highs, supported by government stimulus.\nAnd now coming out of that, we're seeing the COVID vintages mature, albeit at a lagged pace from what\nwould be normal, and we're seeing the incremental acquisitions that we've done start to mature at their\nnormal pace. And so, these loss rates are exacerbated by that impact and that's an important factor we can't\nlose sight of. But the bottom line is that we're watching it. The macro factors matter. We feel good about the\nquality mix that we have, and we'll kind of see how things evolve from here.",

And so, how that evolves\nwill be an important factor. How HPI evolves would be an important consideration here for this portfolio, but\nalso what happens with volumes becomes a factor on reserve builds and how important or how much they\nincrease or decrease.\nAnd then the final piece is mix, and it's kind of related to that revolver point. As we see the mix evolve from\ntransactors to revolvers, that's going to play into how much of a reserve from a lifetime point of view we have\nto continue to build. And so, it's why I mentioned on John's question the importance of looking at the interest\nrates, looking at what's happening with inflation, watching the lower income customer base, because all of\nthose things combined with how we think about the scenarios and the weighting will be a factor on the\nreserves.\nBut I will say, Ken, as I sit here and think about what we have in the quarter, I feel very good about the reserve\nlevels.

So one is, if I think about how the rate\nimplieds have evolved from the 3 to 6 to now something a little bit north of 1 in the context of what I expect\nfor our performance, it doesn't have a material impact on the guidance that I've given of $80 billion to $81\nbillion.\nAnd in part, that's because as I think about the timing for the planned cuts, which was generally back-loaded,\nas well as some of the other factors that play through. So, you know, Argentina just announced a policy rate\nreduction yesterday or a couple of days ago. If rates are a bit higher for longer, we'll watch how the betas\ncontinue to evolve. I mentioned earlier, the late fees for the cards business happened a bit sooner. Late fees\nare actually booked in our NII line. And so, those factors put me in a place where I feel like there will certainly\nbe puts and takes around how that rate curve evolves, and therefore I'm very comfortable kind of leaving the\nguidance where it is.\nTo answer your broader question, in terms of kind of how we are positioned, I'd point you to the 10-K that we\nhave that's out. And in that 10-K, we offer as we have before a number of IRE scenarios for plus or minus 100\nbasis points and what it means for our business. And if you look at it, you'll see that for the aggregate firm,\nfor Citi, US dollar and non-US dollar, that we're asset-sensitive. So, as rates increase, we should see an\nincrease in our NII performance.\nBut if you look at the breakdown and that's about I think it was about $1.4 billion or something in terms of\nthe impact of that move. But if you look at the breakdown, what the breakdown will show is that for US dollar,\nat this point we're neutral. So, if rates were to go up, rates were to go down, no material impact as it relates\nto our revenue.\nFor the non-US dollar, we're still quite asset-sensitive, right? And so, that should give you some sense for\nand we recognize the limitations with IRE, it assumes 100 basis point parallel shift across the curve to a static\nbalance sheet, etcetera, but that should give you some sense for the implications of the rate curve moves as\nit relates to our book of business.",

We have a severely adverse\nscenario that we've run. We've provided a balance sheet as part of the submission, but ultimately, the\nregulators have to run through their models, the information that we've provided and that informs what\nhappens with the stress capital buffer, and we don't have as much transparency to that as we'd like and so\nreally hard to call at this stage.\nThe second part of your question I think is spot-on and I kind of alluded to in my prepared remarks in that\nwe have the medium-term targets that we've set and we're still in the midst of kind of the execution of our\nstrategy, the evolution of the business mix and the business model. The mix towards more consistent,\npredictable and repeatable revenue streams that would impact PPNR, the simplification which obviously\nplays through an expense base that'll be lower when we get to that medium-term period.\nSo all of those things, the divestitures and kind of what that means and how that might impact the G-SIB\nscore and the like and the freeing up of capital which we've already freed up $6 billion or so, and so all of\nthose things have kind of yet to have been factored in and we believe will be beneficial to the SCB over the\nmedium-term.",

Despite that I'm telling you\nthe same I'm making the same point, which is you can expect a downward trend from here through to the\nend of the year and while there won't be additional restructuring charge, there will be the normal BAU activity\naround repositioning that plays through, so hopefully that answers your question, Betsy.
