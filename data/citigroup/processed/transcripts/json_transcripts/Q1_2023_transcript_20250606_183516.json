I am going to share some observations,\nand then we'll turn to what was a good quarter.\nFirst, our banking system as a whole is very strong. While a small handful of institutions still have challenges\nto overcome, the U.S. financial system remains unmatched globally. And I feel confident saying that as\nsomeone who has worked in many different systems around the world.\nThe U.S. system comprises a healthy mix of community banks, regional banks and global banks including\nCiti. We all have important but different roles to play, serving different clients with different needs and on\ndifferent scales. I would also point to the rapid response by state, federal and international regulators that\nhelped reinforce confidence in the system at a critical juncture.\nI am pleased that Citi has been a source of stability for the financial system and a source of strength for our\nclients.\nWe are in a position to play this role because our strategy is delivering a simpler, more focused bank. We\nbenefit from a diversified earnings base and resilient business model. This is reinforced by our robust balance\nsheet management, liquidity position and strong risk management frameworks. We are disciplined in how\nwe run the firm, from client selection to capital planning.\nAnd it is also thanks to our people. I want to express my pride in our colleagues around the world who have\nworked tirelessly last month to serve clients as they turned to Citi as a port in the storm.\nRecent events have shown that prudent asset and liability management is absolutely paramount.

We have highly-liquid investment\nsecurities and a significant amount of cash. We have over $1 trillion of available liquidity resources, including\n$584 billion of HQLA and an LCR of 120%. And we maintain a diverse set of funding sources, including over\n$1.3 trillion of deposits across corporates, consumers, industries, and regions, many of which are operational\nin nature.\nThe cornerstone is our institutional deposit base, which comprises about 60% of our deposits. Most of these\ndeposits are particularly sticky because they sit in operating accounts that are fully integrated into how our\nmultinational clients run their businesses around the world from their payrolls to their supply chains to\ntheir cash and liquidity management. 80% of these deposits are with clients who use all three of our\nintegrated services- payments & collections, liquidity management and working capital solutions.\nThe data that we aggregate from these deposits and their related flows is fundamental to how our clients\nmanage their efficiency, risk and compliance. This greatly increases our deposit stickiness. And that is also\nwhy nearly 80% of these deposits are from client relationships that are 15 years old or more.\nFinally, we operate a strong risk framework that looks at both asset and liability concentrations across client\nsegment, industry, and region, and we are confident in the size and nature of our exposures given our\nrigorous stress testing. We also diligently manage counterparty risk, which is critical given the\ninterconnectedness of financial institutions.\nWe are in a strong position to navigate whatever environment we face which is particularly relevant given\nthe degree of uncertainty today.\nThe Fed continues to use rate policy to battle inflation, which has been more than stubborn in services, even\nas we see signs of cooling in labor and manufacturing. We expect the recent events to be disinflationary and\ncredit to contract. We believe it is now more likely that the U.S. will enter into a shallow recession later this\nbiggest unknown is the impact on terminal short-term US interest rates and, of course, how the debt ceiling\nplays out.\nIn Europe, the ECB is on a similar, but more difficult, quest to tame inflation. They have had some help from\nlower-than-expected energy prices and the outlook continues to be a bit brighter. However, the war in\nUkraine sadly shows no sign of ending and Europe faces more structural challenges such as the need for\nincreased defense spending, higher energy costs and fiscal burdens that will make efforts to dampen\ninflation and stimulate growth more difficult.\nIn Asia, the reopening of China is adding to the momentum in the region although the Chinese consumer has\nbeen slower to rebound than expected. I saw many green shoots firsthand talking to our clients and our\nbankers in my various trips to India, Japan, and Hong Kong this year. We have to keep a close eye on\ngeopolitics as the US-China relationship becomes increasingly strained and is fragmenting economic blocs.\nWe see this translate into shifts in flows and heightened cross-border volume across TTS and our global\nnetwork.\nof $2.19. We had good revenue growth of 6% ex-divestitures and both revenue and expenses were in line\nwith our guidance. Our ROTCE of nearly 11% benefitted from the closing of the sales of our consumer\nbusinesses in India and Vietnam and would have been over 9% without those gains.\nCopyright Â© 2023 Citigroup Inc. 2",

      "paragraph": "T R A N S C R I P T\nCiti First Quarter 2023 Earnings Review\nApril 14, 2023\nLet me highlight our operating performance in each of our five core businesses.\nIn Services, TTS continued to go from strength to strength, with revenues up 31%. Non-interest revenue was\nup 11% quarter-on-quarter-on the back of increased cross-border activity and good performance in\ncommercial cards due to the rebound of corporate travel. Securities Servic\n23% as we executed on new mandates, onboarded new AUC and benefitted from higher rates.\nWithin Markets, our Fixed Income revenues were up 4% from a year ago. We benefitted from excellent\nperformance in Rates and continued engagement from our corporate clients. The first quarter of 2022 was\nno slouch, as you may recall, but this quarter was our third-best in a decade. Equities was weaker however -\ndown markedly in both derivatives and cash, but still had revenues north of $1 billion.\nBanking was down again, but there were signs of the beginning of a rebound, including increased activity in\nthe investment grade debt market.\nIn US Personal Banking, our cards businesses gained momentum as all drivers continue to normalize to pre-\nCOVID levels. Branded Cards and Retail Services saw revenues up 18% and 24% respectively. Retail Banking\nsaw some growth as we continue to see good momentum in mortgages and installment lending and also\nexperienced a significant increase in digital deposits.\nWe did see a notable softening in consumer spending growth over the course of the quarter. Travel and\nentertainment continued to grow in March, but essentials were flat, and almost all other spend categories\nwere down. Savings rates are below historic averages. While the upper quintiles of household income still\nhave roughly a trillion dollars in excess savings, the savings of the lower quintiles have been significantly\ndrawn down. So we are keeping a diligent eye on the lower FICO bands as economic growth and services\nspend slow.\nFinally, we remain confident about the prospects of our Wealth business. Despite the challenging\nheadwinds, growth in Citigold accounts, client acquisition and client advisors were all solid and we expect\nthese drivers to flow through to revenue later this year and beyond. We also saw the early signs of a long-\nawaited Asian recovery.\nWe built credit reserves this quarter on the back of growth in revolving balances in cards and poorer macro-\noutlooks. NCLs continued to normalize in Consumer while the health of our corporate base was evident in\nanother quarter of very low NCLs.\nFinally, we continue to generate capital through our earnings. With our CET1 ratio now at 13.4%, we have\nroom to absorb the temporary, upfront impact should we sign a deal for Mexico. As you know, we continue\nto pursue a dual path here. And we are committed to increasing the amount of capital we return to our\nshareholders over time.\nAs you can see from slide three, in addition to good operating performance from our businesses and, despite\neverything else going on in the industry, we got a lot done this quarter as we implement the strategy that we\nshared with you at Investor Day.\nWe closed the sales of our consumer businesses in India and Vietnam. Indonesia and Taiwan are next on the\nlist to close later in the year. Our Asian consumer sales will then be complete, and we are intensifying our\nefforts to eliminate stranded costs and simplify our organizational structure.\nWe made some significant leadership announcements. I am delighted that Andy Sieg will join Citi at my table\nas the new head of Wealth Management. Andy is a widely respected leader in this space and comes to us\nafter running an $18 billion business with $2.8 trillion in client balances. He is the latest and the most visible\nexample of the excellent talent we have attracted over the last couple of years.\nCopyright Â© 2023 Citigroup Inc. 3",

I am going to start with the Firmwide\nfinancial results, focusing on year-over-year comparisons for the first quarter unless I indicate otherwise,\nand spend a little more time on expenses, our balance sheet and capital. Then I will turn to the results of\neach segment.\nOn slide 4, we show financial results for the full firm. In the first quarter, we reported net income of\napproximately $4.6 billion and an EPS of $2.19 and a RoTCE of nearly 11% on $21.4 billion of revenues.\nEmbedded in these results are pre-tax divestiture-related impacts of approximately $950 million, largely\ndriven by the gain on sale of the India consumer business. Excluding these items, EPS was $1.86 with an\nRoTCE of over 9%. In the quarter, total revenues increased by 12% on a reported basis and increased 6%\nexcluding divestiture-related impacts as strength across Services, Fixed Income and .S Personal Banking\nwas partially offset by declines in Investment Banking, Equity Markets and Wealth, as well as the revenue\nreduction from the closed exits and wind-downs.\nOur results include expenses of $13.3 billion, an increase of 1% versus the prior year. Excluding divesture-\nrelated costs in the prior year, expenses increased by 5% largely driven by the transformation, other risk &\ncontrol investments and inflation, partially offset by productivity savings and the expense reductions from\nthe exits and wind-downs.\nCost of credit was approximately $2.0 billion, primarily driven by the continued normalization in Card net\ncredit losses and ACL and other provision builds of approximately $700 million, largely related to a\ndeterioration in macroeconomic assumptions and growth in card revolving balances.\nAt the end of the quarter, we had nearly $20 billion in total reserves with a reserve-to-funded loans ratio of\napproximately 2.7%.\nOn Slide 5, we show an expense walk for the first quarter, with the key underlying drivers. Transformation\ninvestments drove ~1% of the growth largely in the data, finance and risk and control programs. And 4% of\nthe increase is driven by structural, largely in the form of compensation and benefits including the full-year\nimpact of the people we hired last year as well as those we hired in the first quarter.\nEmbedded in this structural bucket are a few key items. First, other risk and control investments that are\nenterprise wide and in the businesses make up about 2% of the total expense increase. Second, the impact\nCopyright Â© 2023 Citigroup Inc. 4",

All of this was partially offset\nby productivity savings as well as the benefit from foreign exchange translation and the expense reduction\nfrom the exits and across the firm, technology-related expenses grew 12%.\nWe recognize these investments have driven a significant increase in expenses, but they are crucial to\nmodernize the firm, address the consent orders and position Citi for success in the years to come.\ninvesting in and the benefits we will see over time.\nIn many cases, these investments will simplify our processes and platforms. For example, we are retiring\nand consolidating 20 cash equities platforms to one single modern platform, eliminating costs over time.\nAnd we have consolidated 11 platforms to one global sanctions-screening platform, reducing false alerts,\nimproving the client experience and eliminating costs.\nWe are also modernizing our infrastructure and the security of our data and information by enhancing cyber\nsecurity through the use of AI and improving the security of our infrastructure and devices, leading to fewer\noperating losses. And we are leveraging industry-leading cloud-based solutions to modernize and\nstreamline the connectivity between our front office systems and the general ledger, eliminating manual\nprocesses and operating costs over time.\nWe are driving the strategy by investing in the client experience both in terms of our technology interface\nand innovative new products. We launched our cloud-based instant payments platform for eCommerce\nclients in TTS. We are also deploying CitiDirect Commercial Banking, our mobile and digital interface for\nCommercial clients so they too can open accounts and access all products and services across ICG in the\nsame way our Large Corporate clients do. And finally, we are investing in data to create advanced decision\nmaking, client targeting, and risk management capabilities which has allowed us to enhance our returns\nthrough greater RWA efficiency. And we expect many of these investments to generate efficiencies that will\nallow us to self-fund future investments over time.\nfirst quarter, net interest income increased by approximately $80 million, largely driven by interest-earning\nbalances in cards. Average loans were up slightly as growth in PBWM was largely offset by a decline in ICG.\nAverage deposits were also up slightly, driven by growth in both PBWM and ICG. And our net interest margin\nincreased 2 basis points.\nOn Slide 8, we show key consumer and corporate credit metrics. We are well reserved for the current\nenvironment with nearly $20 billion of reserves. Our reserves-to-funded loans ratio is approximately 2.7%.\nAnd within that, US Cards is 8.1%. In PBWM, 44% of our lending exposures are in US cards and of that\nexposure, nearly 80% is to customers with FICOs of 680 or higher.\nAnd NCL rates, while reflecting some typical seasonality this quarter, are still below pre-COVID levels and\nare normalizing in line with our expectations. The remaining 56% of our PBWM lending exposure is largely\nin Wealth and predominantly mortgages and margin lending. In our ICG portfolio, of our total exposure,\napproximately 85% is investment grade. Of the international exposure, approximately 90% is investment\ngrade or exposure to multinational clients or their subsidiaries. And corporate non-accrual loans remain\nlow at about 40 basis points of total loans.\nAs you can see on the page, we break out our Commercial Real Estate lending exposures across ICG and\nPBWM which total $66 billion, of which 90% is investment grade. So, while the macro and geopolitical\nenvironment remains uncertain, we feel very good about our asset quality, exposures and reserve levels\nand we continuously review and stress the portfolio under a range of scenarios.\nCopyright Â© 2023 Citigroup Inc. 5",

We leverage our unique\nassets and capabilities to serve corporates, financial institutions, investors, and individuals with global\nneeds. First, the majority of our deposits, $819 billion, are institutional, and span 90 countries. And the\nmajority of these institutional deposits tend to be interest rate sensitive so when rates go up, we reprice\nthe deposits accordingly, but that reprice takes into account the overall client relationship as well as the\nlevel of rates.\nBut despite this interest rate sensitivity, these deposits tend to be stable as they are tied to the operational\nservices we provide. And these institutional deposits are complemented by $437 billion of US Retail\nconsumer and global wealth deposits as you can see on the bottom right side of the page. These deposits\nare well diversified across the Private Bank, Citigold, Retail and Wealth at Work as well as across regions\nand products, with 75% of US Citigold clients and approximately 50% of ultra-high net worth clients having\nbeen with Citi for more than 10 years. Our wealth deposits tend to also be interest rate sensitive, but this\nusually results in our customers moving to higher-yielding investment and deposit products.\nNow turning to the asset side, at a high-level, you can think about our deposits being largely deployed in\nthree asset buckets loans, investment securities and cash which complement the interest rate\nsensitivity and liquidity value of our liabilities. And this deployment is also linked to our strategy we use\nour resources to lend and transact with our clients in ways that deepen the relationship and drive returns\nfor our shareholders while maintaining strong liquidity and capital.\nOur $652 billion loan portfolio is well diversified across consumer and corporate loans. And the duration of\nthe total portfolio is approximately 1.3 years as the majority of these loans are variable-rate. About 35% of\nour balance sheet is in cash and investment securities which contribute to our $1 trillion of available\nliquidity resources. And at the end of the quarter, we had an LCR of 120%, which means we have roughly\n$100 billion of HQLA in excess of the amount required by the rule to cover stressed outflows. And you can\nsee the details of this on page 27 in the appendix. But just as important as the quantum of liquidity is the\ncomposition and duration of that liquidity.\nAnd our $513 billion investment portfolio consists largely of highly liquid US Treasury, Agency and other\nsovereign bonds, and is split evenly between available-for-sale and held-to-\nmaintained a short duration of less than three years so we could benefit from higher interest rates.\nAnd we actively and prudently manage our assets and liabilities by considering a range of possible stress\nscenarios and how they might impact interest rate risk, liquidity, and capital.\nSo, in summary, our assets and liabilities are aligned across interest rate sensitivity, liquidity value and\nduration, and reflect the diversified business model and execution of our strategy.\nOn Slide 10, we show a sequential CET1 walk to provide more detail on the drivers this quarter. Walking from\nthe end of fourth quarter. First, we generated $4.3 billion of net income to common which added 38 basis\npoints. Second, we returned $1.0 billion in the form of common dividends, which drove a reduction of about\n9 basis points. Third, impact on AOCI through our AFS investment portfolio drove a 7 basis point increase.\nAnd finally, the remaining 4 basis point increase was largely driven by the RWA benefit from closing our\nconsumer exits.\nCopyright Â© 2023 Citigroup Inc. 6",

Revenues were up\n1% this quarter, largely driven by Services and Fixed income, mostly offset by Investment Banking and\nEquities. Expenses increased 4%, driven by transformation, other risk and control investments and\nvolume-related expenses, partially offset by FX translation and productivity savings.\nCost of credit was a $72 million benefit, as an ACL release more than offset net credit losses. This resulted\nin net income of approximately $3.3 billion, up 23%, driven by the lower cost of credit and higher revenues,\npartially offset by higher expenses. ICG delivered a 13.8% RoTCE for the quarter.\nAnd average loans were down 2% reflecting discipline around our strategy and returns. Average deposits\nwere up 3% as we continued to acquire new clients and deepen relationships with existing ones. And\nsequentially, average deposits were up 1%. And on an end of period basis, ICG deposits were down 3%\nsequentially, driven by seasonality as our clients tend to make tax payments in the first quarter.\nOn Slide 12, we show revenue performance by business and the key drivers we laid out at Investor Day. In\nTreasury and Trade Solutions, revenues were up 31%, driven by 41% growth in net interest income and 13%\nin NIR, with growth across all client segments. We continue to see healthy underlying drivers in TTS that\nindicate consistently strong client activity with US Dollar Clearing Volumes up 6%, reflecting continued\nSWIFT share gains. Cross-border flows up 10%, outpacing global GDP growth. Commercial card volumes\nup roughly 40%, led by spend in travel.\nSo, while the rate environment drove about 60% of the growth this quarter, business actions drove the\nremaining 40%, as we continued to deepen relationships with existing clients and win new clients. In fact,\nclient wins are up approximately 50%, across all segments. These include marquee transactions where we\nIn Securities Services, revenues grew 23% as net interest income grew 94%, driven by higher interest rates\nacross currencies, partially offset by a 6% decrease in non-interest revenue due to the impact of market\nvaluations. We are pleased with the execution in Securities Services as we continue to onboard assets\nunder custody and administration from significant client wins and we feel very good about the pipeline of\nnew deals. As a reminder, the Services businesses are central to our strategy and are two of our higher-\nreturning businesses with strong linkages across the firm.\nMarkets revenues were down 4% as growth in Fixed Income was more than offset by Equities. Fixed Income\nrevenues were up 4%, relative to a very strong quarter last year, as strength in our Rates franchise was\npartially offset by a decline in FX and Commodities. Equities revenues were down 25%, also relative to a\nstrong quarter last year, primarily reflecting reduced client activity in Cash and Equity Derivatives.\nCorporate client flows remained strong and stable and we continued to make solid progress on our\nrevenue-to-RWA target\nAnd finally, Banking revenues, excluding gains and losses on loan hedges, were down 21%, driven by\nInvestment Banking, as heightened macro uncertainty and volatility continued to impact client activity.\nHaving said that, we do see revenue growth sequentially largely driven by the investment grade market\nopening up.\nCopyright Â© 2023 Citigroup Inc. 7",

Average deposits\ndecreased 3%, largely reflecting our Wealth clients putting cash to work in fixed income investments on our\nplatform. And PBWM delivered an RoTCE of 5.5%, largely driven by higher credit costs.\nOn Slide 14, we show PBWM revenues by product as well as key business drivers and metrics. Branded\nCards revenues were up 18%, driven by higher net interest income. We continue to see strong underlying\ndrivers with new account acquisitions up 17%, card spend volumes up 9% and average loans up 15%. Retail\nServices revenues were up 24%, also driven by higher net interest income.\nFor both Card portfolios, we continue to see payment rates decline, and that combined with the\ninvestments we have been making contributed to growth in interest-earning balances of 18% in Branded\nCards and 11% in Retail Services.\nRetail Banking revenues were up 3%, primarily driven by higher mortgage revenue and strong growth in\npersonal installment lending, partially offset by the impact of the transfer of relationships and the\nassociated deposits to our Wealth business. In fact, consistent with the strategy, we continued to leverage\nour retail network to drive over 13,000 Wealth referrals in the first quarter.\nWealth revenues were down 9%, driven by continued investment fee headwinds and higher deposit costs\nparticularly in the Private Bank. However, we did see notable improvement in revenues in Asia which were\nup approximately 20% on a sequential basis.\nClient advisors were up 3%. And we are seeing net new investment inflows and strong new client\nacquisitions across our Wealth business, with new clients in the Private Bank and Wealth at Work up 62%\nand 81%, respectively.\nWhile the environment continues to remain challenging for Wealth, we are seeing strong underlying\nbusiness drivers as we execute against our strategy.\nOn Slide 15, we show results for Legacy Franchises. Revenues grew 48%, driven by a gain on the sale of our\nconsumer business in India, partially offset by the wind-downs and closed consumer exits. Expenses\ndecreased 24%, largely driven by the absence of a goodwill impairment we had in the prior year as well as\nthe impact of the wind-downs and closed consumer exits.\nOn Slide 16, we show results for Corporate Other for the first quarter. Revenues increased, largely driven by\nhigher net revenue from the investment portfolio. Expenses increased, driven by transformation and other\nrisk and control investments, partially offset by a reduction in consulting fees.\nCopyright Â© 2023 Citigroup Inc. 8",

And when you think about where that comes from, the strength in TTS, the\nstrength in Securities Services, both benefiting from the rate hikes we saw last year, but also deepening\nrelationships with new and existing clients, the Card momentum, which is really about seeing more\nrevolving activity as payment rates start to slow, and the recovery in Investment Banking and Wealth is not\nas swift as we would like and so we have to see how that plays out too.\nSo when I put those things together, there's certainly some puts and takes that speaks to the diversification\nof our business model, but it leaves me in a place where I'm comfortable with the guidance that we've set,\nand if that changes, we'll certainly update you, but that's where we are.",

So both the extent of that diversification and the increasing stickiness versus history\nis something that we're certainly not complacent about, but I think is why you see from the pages we've put\ninto the deck as well including in the back on just the consistency of this base.\nMark, what would you add?",

That's going to have a broad industry impact as we've started to\nsee already, but we're also in an environment where rates are increasing. We'll see how that plays out\nthrough the balance of the year.

And so we've obviously talked about betas\nincreasing particularly in our TTS portfolio, more so in the US.

As I sit here in\nMarch, it probably is going to skew a little bit less non-US and a little bit more towards the US, and you'll\nsee that in the 10-Q.\nWith that said, I mentioned earlier, there's still a bit of uncertainty in terms of how rates continue to evolve\nhere in the US. We'll see how betas evolve. We've reached terminal betas in the US with our clients kind of\nat the end of last year, and so we'll see kind of what happens in terms of pricing through the balance of\n2023.\nBetas are not quite at terminal levels outside of the US, and so we'll see the pacing of that, again, in light of\nhow the interest rate curve may be evolving and frankly in light of how we've seen the broader sector turmoil\nplay out. That could in fact play to our benefit. But we are also, again, in an environment where there's\nquantitative tightening that is still at play.\nAnd then the final point I'd make, Mike, that often people forget is that in that NII is Legacy NII, and so as\nwe continue with our wind-downs, our divestitures, et cetera, that's going to be a headwind that we will\nhave to deal with.",

As you point out, we grew capital pretty sizably this\nquarter, up to 13.4% from a CET1 ratio point of view and up significantly from a year ago, some 200 basis\npoints or so. And a good portion of that, a significant portion of that, was really net income earnings\ngeneration, which is important.\nLook, the way we think about it is that 13.4%, we certainly have well-above what's required from a regulatory\npoint of view and it includes our internal management buffer of about 100 basis points. But as we've said in\nthe past, there is certainly the Mexico transaction and that would be a temporary drag to CET1 at signing, the\ndifference between signing and closing if it were a sale to take place. And then there are a couple of other\nfactors that are out there as well.\nSo think about the Basel III end game that's out there and the capital requirements that could come out of\nthat. Think about the CCAR DFAST that has been submitted and currently under review, and what that might\nmean for stress capital buffers, and also think about just where we are in the broader economy and broader\nglobal macro environment that we're playing in and needing to see how that kind of evolves. And so when I\nthink about all of those factors, we're in a place where we will continue to take it quarter-by-quarter, but I'd\nend by saying our bias is kind of where yours is, which is given where we're trading, all things being equal,\nwe'd like to be buying back shares, but we have to be responsible about that and the timing of that.",

I'm\npleased with the progress they're making. I think we're seeing, when we look at the performance of our\nMexican franchise, a lot of the really strong performance is happening in our ICG business where Mexico is\nsuch a beneficiary of the supply chain dynamics that are happening around the world, and its location is\nobviously very beneficial given the proximity to the US as well. So I think a lot of the dynamic and the big\nbenefits here coming in the institutional franchise that we're keeping within Citi as a core part of our\nbusiness.\nSo the current Mexican economy doesn't really have so much of an impact on our current decision-making.\nThe principle is we will take the path that is in the best interest of our shareholders.",

It would likely take longer as we would want a set of full audited financials, et cetera.

We're seeing NCL rates increase, but\nparticularly driven by the lower FICO score customers across the portfolio which is where you would expect\nto start to see that drag occur, and the NCL rates that we're seeing are still well below what we would see\nin a normal cycle and they're in line with what we've been forecasting for performance.

It will likely play through those normal levels a bit before\ntapering.\nBut my point here is that we understand our customers, the portfolio, and how it reacts to the environment\nenough to forecast that out, and so far, that's been performing in line with that forecast and those\nestimates. And importantly, we continue to stress it to make sure we're not missing anything and\nimportantly, we carry a sizable reserve, as you know, as part of that $20 billion.\nCopyright Â© 2023 Citigroup Inc. 17",

So can you just\ngiven the changes that we're seeing ahead of us and definitely saw some normalization happen this quarter,\ncan you just, are you still on line for that getting to that 3-3.5% and 5-5.5% in the respective card\nbusinesses by around year-end this year?",

With that said, if you remember in the fourth quarter, we saw a nice run-up in deposits, and then\nwe have the seasonality point that I referenced in my prepared remarks where we have both operational\npayments from our large TTS clients as well as tax payments with our TTS clients, also with Wealth clients\nto some extent kind of playing through the end-of-period deposits.

We've\nbroken down the deposits for each of the businesses that we have, and at the bottom, you see the TTS\ndeposits, and this is where the 5,000 or so large multinational client deposits reside, and you can see the\nstability, as well as the steady growth in those deposits over time. And to your point, these are largely\noperational deposits that these clients have with us, and we shouldn't mistake rate sensitivity or betas with\nstickiness, right, and it's because these deposits tend to be quite sticky with us, as you can see here.\nNow, they're price-sensitive in the sense that as rates go up, we often have to reprice those. But remember,\nthe relationships we have with these clients are broader than just deposit relationships, and that's what\ngives us the opportunity to adjust pricing accordingly with our deposits both in the US and outside of the\nUS. And so the other page, in your own time you can look at it is the page prior to that which again speaks\nto the diversification of the portfolio but it also speaks to the length of time that many of these clients have\nbeen with us and have grown with us, and so nearly 80% of our deposits are from clients that have a greater\nthan 15 year relationship with us, and that says a lot. And so anyway, those are the two points I'd make.\nHopefully that addresses your question around the stickiness.",
