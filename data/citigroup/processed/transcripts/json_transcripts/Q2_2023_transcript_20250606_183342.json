We are also on track to meet the expense guidance for the year. And, consistent with the plan we\nshared with you at our Investor Day, we are pursuing cost saving opportunities to help offset the significant\ninvestments in our Transformation.\nIn Services, TTS continues to deliver, with revenues up a healthy 15%. This was driven by both net interest\nincome and non-interest revenue as we win fee-generating mandates with new clients and deepen our\nrelationships with existing large corporate and commercial clients. We are proud of our number one ranking\nfor large institutional clients1. And this week, we announced our latest innovation, Citi Direct Commercial\nBanking, a digital platform to help our growing commercial clients tap into our global network.\nSecurities Services revenues were also up 15%, driven by higher interest rates across currencies. We are\nreally pleased with execution in this business as we continue to bring in new assets under custody and\nadministration, which are up by approximately $2.4 trillion in the last year. And we have gained 100 basis\npoints in share year-over-year as a result of the investments we have been making2.\nMarkets revenues were down 13%, compared to an exceptionally strong second quarter last year. From\nearly April, clients stood on the sidelines as the debt ceiling played out and we continued to experience very\nlow levels of volatility throughout the quarter. Despite this, our corporate client flows remained strong, and\nwe achieved our medium-term revenue-to-RWA target again this quarter.\nIn Banking, the momentum in investment grade debt has spread into other DCM products. But the long-\nawaited rebound in Investment Banking has yet to materialize, and it was a disappointing quarter in terms\nof both the wallet and our own performance with Investment Banking revenues down 24%. We continue\nto right-size the business to the environment whilst making investments in selected areas such as\nTechnology and Healthcare.\nIn the U.S., taken together our cards businesses had double-digit revenue growth aided by customer\nengagement and the continued normalization in payment rates. In Branded Cards, spend is still strong in\ntravel and entertainment, and acquisitions remain pretty healthy. This is a great franchise, and we have\nlaunched a raft of new innovations from transforming our ThankYou rewards platform to our enhanced\nvalue proposition for the premium card with our longtime partner, American Airlines.\nCredit normalization is happening faster in Retail Services, given the p\nsay we are seeing a more cautious consumer but not necessarily a recessionary one.\nWealth revenues were down 5% as the business continues to be negatively impacted by the deposit mix\nshift, particularly in the Private Bank, and by lower investment revenues. However, we have seen activity\npick up a bit in Asia for two quarters with growing net new assets. Referrals from the U.S. retail bank are\nincreasing, and globally, new client acquisition in the Private Bank and Wealth at Work has grown\nsignificantly on the back of our investments in our network of client advisors and bankers.\nTurning to expenses, they were elevated this quarter, as we expected. This includes the additional\nrepositioning actions we took to right size certain businesses and functions in light of the current\nenvironment. Year-to-date, severance is about $450 million, including $200 million in the quarter.\nSeparate to repositioning, we remain committed to bending our expense curve by the end of 2024 through\nthree significant efforts.\nFirst, we continue to make investments in our Transformation and other risk and control initiatives which\nare necessary to modernize our infrastructure, automate our controls, as well as improve the client\nexperience. As we said before, we will start to see the more material benefits of these investments over the\nCopyright Â© 2023 Citigroup Inc. 2\n1 al revenues.

In the second quarter, we reported net income of\napproximately $2.9 billion and an EPS of $1.33 and an RoTCE of 6.4% on $19.4 billion of revenues.\nEmbedded in these results are after-tax divestiture-related impacts of approximately $(92) million.\nExcluding these items, EPS was $1.37 with an RoTCE of 6.6%. In the quarter, total revenues decreased by\n1% both on a reported basis and excluding divestiture-related impacts, as strength across Services, U.S.\nPersonal Banking and revenue from the investment portfolio, was more than offset by declines in Markets,\nInvestment Banking and Wealth, as well as the revenue reduction from the closed exits and wind-downs.\nOur results include expenses of $13.6 billion, up 9% both on a reported basis and excluding divesture-related\ncosts.\nCost of credit was approximately $1.8 billion, primarily driven by the continued normalization in Cards net\ncredit losses and ACL builds, largely related to growth in card balances.\nOur effective tax rate this quarter was 27%, primarily driven by the geographic mix of our pre-tax earnings in\nthe quarter. Excluding current quarter divestiture-related impacts, our effective tax rate was 26%.\nAt the end of the quarter, we had over $20 billion in total reserves with a reserve-to-funded loans ratio of\napproximately 2.7%. And through the first half of 2023, we reported an RoTCE of 8.7%.\nOn Slide 5, we show the quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year expense variance for the second quarter.\nExpenses were up 9%, driven by a number of factors, including investments in risk and controls, business-\nled and enterprise-led investments, volume growth and macro factors, including inflation, as well as\nseverance, and all of this was partially offset by productivity savings and expense reductions from the exits\nand wind-downs\nSeverance in the quarter was approximately $200 million, and $450 million year-to-date, as we took further\nactions across Investment Banking, Markets and the Functions.\nWe are investing in the execution of our Transformation and continue to see a shift in our investments from\nthird-party consulting to technology and full-time employees. And as we said last quarter, our\nTransformation and technology investments span across the following themes: Platform and process\nsimplification, security and infrastructure modernization, client experience enhancements and data\nimprovements.\nDespite the higher expense base sequentially, we remain in line with our full year guidance of roughly $54\nbillion, excluding divestiture-related impacts and the FDIC special assessment.\nriances. In the\nsecond quarter, net interest income increased by approximately $550 million, largely driven by dividends.\nThe increase in net interest income ex-Markets was largely driven by higher rates and cards growth, partially\noffset by the mix shift that we have seen to higher rate deposit products within PBWM.\nAverage loans were flat as growth in PBWM was offset by the wind-down markets and a decline in ICG, as\nwe continue to optimize the loan portfolio including a further reduction in subscription credit facilities.\nAverage deposits were down 2%, largely driven by TTS as we saw some non-operational outflow as expected\nin light of quantitative tightening. However, underlying this, we did see strong growth in operating accounts\nCopyright Â© 2023 Citigroup Inc. 4",

And our net interest margin increased 7\nbasis points.\nOn Slide 7, we show key consumer and corporate credit metrics. We are well reserved for the current\nenvironment with over $20 billion of total reserves. Our reserves-to-funded loans ratio is approximately\n2.7%. And within that, U.S. Cards is 7.9%.\nIn PBWM, 44% of our lending exposures are in US cards and of that exposure, 80% is to customers with\nFICOs of 680 or higher. And NCL rates are still below pre-COVID levels and are normalizing in line with our\nexpectations. The remaining 56% of our PBWM lending exposure is largely in Wealth, predominantly in\nmortgages and margin lending.\nIn our ICG portfolio, of our total exposure, approximately 85% is investment grade. Of the international\nexposure, approximately 90% is investment grade or exposure to multinational clients or their subsidiaries.\nAnd corporate non-accrual loans remain low at about 44 basis points of total loans.\nAs you can see on the page, we break out our Commercial Real Estate lending exposures across ICG and\nPBWM which totals $66 billion, of which 90% is investment grade.\nSo, while the macro and geopolitical environment remains uncertain, we feel very good about our asset\nquality, exposures and reserve levels and we continuously review and stress the portfolio under a range of\nscenarios.\nOn Slide 8, we show our summary balance sheet and key capital and liquidity metrics. We maintain a very\nstrong $2.4 trillion balance sheet which is funded in part by a well-diversified $1.3 trillion deposit base across\nregions, industries, customers and account types which is deployed into high-quality, diversified assets. Our\nbalance sheet reflects our strategy and well diversified business model. We leverage our unique assets and\ncapabilities to serve corporates, financial institutions, investors, and individuals with global needs.\nThe majority of our deposits, $818 billion, are institutional and operational in nature and span across 90\ncountries. These institutional deposits are complemented by $427 billion of US Retail consumer and global\nwealth deposits as you can see on the bottom right side of the page.\nWe have approximately $584 billion of HQLA and approximately $661 billion of loans and we maintain total\nliquidity resources of just under $1 trillion. Our LCR was relatively stable at 119% and our net stable funding\nratio was greater than 100%. We ended the quarter with a 13.3% CET1 ratio. And our tangible book value per\nshare was $85.34, up 6% from a year ago.\nOn Slide 9, we show a sequential CET1 walk to provide more detail on the drivers this quarter. Starting from\nthe end of the first quarter. First, we generated $2.6 billion of net income to common which added 22 basis\npoints. Second, we returned $2.0 billion in the form of common dividends and share repurchases, which\ndrove a reduction of about 18 basis points And finally, the remaining 14 basis point decrease was primarily\ndriven by RWA growth as we continued to grow card balances, partially offset by optimizing RWA in Markets\nand Corporate Lending\nWe ended the quarter with a 13.3% CET1 capital ratio, which includes a 100 basis point internal management\nbuffer. We expect our regulatory capital requirement to be 12.3% in October of 2023, which incorporates the\nincrease in our Stress Capital Buffer from 4% to the preliminary SCB of 4.3% we announced a couple weeks\nago. And we will continue our dialogue with the Fed to better understand the differences between their\nmodeled results and ours, specifically in non-interest revenue.\nThat said, our strategy is designed to further diversify our business mix to have a more consistent,\nCopyright Â© 2023 Citigroup Inc. 5",

The strategy and the simplification coupled with the benefits of our\ntransformation investments will allow us to improve RWA and capital over time. The continued optimization\nof our balance sheet should not only help SCB but reduce RWA. This will offset some of the anticipated\nheadwinds in capital requirements and RWA. And we will continue to reassess how and where we deploy\ncapital and evaluate the appropriate level of our management buffer over time.\nOn Slide 10, we show the results for our Institutional Clients Group for the second quarter.\nRevenues were down 9% this quarter, as growth in Services was more than offset by Markets and Banking.\nExpenses increased 13%, primarily driven by continued investments in TTS and risk and controls, as well as\napproximately $120 million of severance in Investment Banking and Markets, partially offset by productivity\nsavings.\nCost of credit was $58 million, as net credit losses were partially offset by an ACL release. This resulted in\nnet income of approximately $2.2 billion, down 45%, primarily driven by lower revenues and higher\nexpenses. ICG delivered an RoTCE of 9.2% for the quarter and 11.4% through the first half of 2023.\nAverage loans were down 6% reflecting discipline around our strategy and returns. Average deposits were up\n1% as we continued to acquire new clients and deepen relationships with existing ones.\nOn Slide 11, we show revenue performance by business and the key drivers we laid out at Investor Day. In\nTreasury and Trade Solutions, revenues were up 15%, driven by 18% growth in net interest income and 8% in\nnon- -FX basis. We continue\nto see healthy underlying drivers in TTS that indicate consistently strong client activity with, U.S. Dollar\nClearing Volumes up 6%, both in the quarter and through the first half of 2023, Cross-border flows up 11%,\noutpacing global GDP growth, both in the quarter and through the first half of 2023, and commercial card\nvolumes up roughly 15%, led by spend in travel In fact, similar to the last few quarters, client wins are up\napproximately 41% across all client segments. These include marquee transactions where we are serving as\nIn Securities Services, revenues were also up 15%, driven by higher net interest income across currencies. We\nare pleased with the progress in Securities Services as we continue to onboard assets under custody and\nadministration, which are up approximately 11% or $2.4 trillion dollars And we feel very good about the\npipeline of new deals in Securities Services As a reminder, the Services businesses are central to our strategy\nand are two of our higher-returning businesses with strong synergies across the firm.\nMarkets revenues were down 13%, driven by both Fixed Income and Equities, relative to an exceptional\nquarter last year coupled with low volatility this quarter. Fixed Income revenues were down 13%, as strength\nin our Rates franchise was more than offset by a decline in Currencies and Commodities. Equities revenues\nwere down 10%, primarily reflecting a decline in Equity Derivatives. But consistent with our strategy, we\ncontinued to grow Prime balances, driven by client wins. Corporate client flows remained strong and stable\nand we continued to make solid progress on our revenue-to-RWA target And finally, Banking revenues,\nexcluding gains and losses on loan hedges, were down 22%, driven by Investment Banking, as heightened\nmacro uncertainty continued to impact client activity, as well as lower revenues in Corporate Lending. While\nwe continue to have a strong pipeline and are seeing green shoots of activity, we recognize there is more work\nto do in ECM and M&A. That said, we believe the investments we have made in Healthcare and Technology\ncoverage will benefit us over time.\nSo overall, while the market environment remains challenging and there is more work to be done, we are\nmaking progress against our strategy in ICG.\nNow turning to Slide 12, we show the results for our Personal Banking & Wealth Management business.\nCopyright Â© 2023 Citigroup Inc. 6",

Expenses were up 5%,\npredominantly driven by risk and control investments.\nCost of credit was $1.6 billion, driven by higher net credit losses as we continue to see normalization in our\ncard portfolios and a reserve build of $335 million, primarily driven by card balance growth.\nAverage loans increased 7% driven by cards, mortgages and installment lending. Average deposits\ndecreased 1%, largely reflecting our Wealth clients putting cash to work in fixed income investments on our\nplatform. And PBWM delivered an RoTCE of 5.5%, both for this quarter and through the first half of 2023,\nlargely reflecting the challenging environment for Wealth and higher credit costs.\nOn Slide 13, we show PBWM revenues by product as well as key business drivers and metrics. Branded Cards\nrevenues were up 8%, primarily driven by higher net interest income. We continue to see strong underlying\ndrivers with new account acquisitions up 6%, card spend volumes up 4% and average loans up 14%. Retail\nServices revenues were up 27%, driven by higher net interest income and lower partner payments. For both\nCard portfolios, we continue to see payment rates decline, and that combined with the investments we have\nbeen making contributed to growth in interest-earning balances of 17% in Branded Cards and 12% in Retail\nServices.\nRetail Banking revenues decreased 9%, reflecting the transfer of relationships and the associated deposits\nto our Wealth business. In fact, consistent with our strategy, we continued to leverage our retail network to\ndrive 25,000 Wealth referrals year-to-date through May, up 18% YoY.\nWealth revenues were down 5%, driven by continued investment fee headwinds and higher deposit costs,\nparticularly in the Private Bank.

And new client acquisitions were up nearly 40% in the Private Bank and approximately 60% in\nWealth-at-\nmomentum in underlying drivers.\nOn Slide 14, we show results for Legacy Franchises.

Expenses decreased 2%, primarily\ndriven by closed consumer exits and wind-downs. Excluding divestiture-related impacts, expenses\ndecreased 8%.\nOn Slide 15, we show results for Corporate Other for the second quarter.

Expenses also increased, driven by inflation and\nseverance.\nmaintaining our full-year\nrevenue guidance of $78 - $79 billion, excluding 2023 divestiture-related impacts, although the mix has\nshifted somewhat. We are increasing our net interest income guidance from $45 billion to slightly above $46\nbillion for the full year excluding Markets, offset by lower non-interest revenue, largely driven by Investment\nBanking and Wealth.\nWe are also maintaining our expense guidance of roughly $54 billion, excluding 2023 divestiture-related\nimpacts and the FDIC special assessment. Net credit losses in Cards should continue to normalize in the\nremainder of the year, with both portfolios reaching normalized levels by year-end.

      "paragraph": "Thanks Glenn and good morning, and thanks for the question. Look, a couple of points on\nthat. One is we've been very focused on the revenue to RWA metric in our Markets business in the ICG more\nbroadly as well. And we've made considerable progress on that. And that's important because how we use\nthe balance sheet and ensuring that we're optimizing the use of the balance sheet contributes to how we\nimprove returns over time.\nYou're right to point out the subscription facility, credit facility, lending that we do. We brought that down\npretty significantly. The numbers you highlight are a lot higher than the portfolio. But what's important here\nis that as we look at that, we look at a couple of things. So, one, the nature of relationship and whether clients\nare taking advantage of the breadth of what we have to offer. Two, the profitability and returns associated\nwith the product to the extent that it is in a broader relationship, and where those returns are low, subpar,\nand the prospect for doing more has proven to be fruitless, we take it down. And that's what we've done with\na large part of that book, just as we juxtapose it against other opportunities to use balance sheet where\nclients are taking advantage of the broader franchise and therefore, are generating higher returns.\nAnd we're going to continue to do that. We've done that to drive the revenue to RWA metric. We've done it\nselectively on pieces of the portfolio like SCF. We've also looked at our broader corporate lending portfolio\nand where those promises for higher relationship returns aren't manifesting themselves, we've not renewed\nthose loans. And as we think about pending regulatory changes, proactively making these efforts becomes\ncritically important. When I look back on the activity that we've done over the past couple of years, we've\nreduced RWA by approximately $120 billion over the last 2 years, and about 75% of that is predominantly\ndriven by balance sheet optimization and looking at client activity that has low margin business. And so, this\nis important for us to do and to keep doing.",

So, one is that we can certainly look back in time, but I would highlight that we're\nhere because we needed to have invested more in our franchise. And so undoubtedly, there's going to be an\nincrease in our expense base that reflects the underinvestment from the past and in shoring up safety and\nsoundness and actually moving towards a more automated operational, more modernized operations and\ninfrastructure. So, there's certainly going to be that.\nWith that said, with those investments come efficiencies. So, with the move from manual to automation over\ntime, those types of investments will yield benefits in our cost structure. And that's part of what is going to\nbend the curve over that medium-term period. The other thing that I'd highlight is, obviously, with the Legacy\nFranchises, there's $7 billion of expense associated with those, and that will come down. But because of the\nMexico transaction, we're going to be stuck with that a little bit longer given the IPO process. It doesn't put a\nbig dent in our ability to bring stranded costs down and by the way, it does come with top line revenues and\nhistorically has been accretive to our profitability and returns.\nAnd so, I'm not going to give you kind of new guidance on where our expenses will end up. But what I will\npoint you to is not only the $54 billion this year, roughly $54 billion this year, not only the bending of the\ncurve in the third and fourth quarter or the third to the fourth quarter next year. But we've given guidance on\ntop line growth, revenue of 5% call it CAGR through that medium-term period, and we've given you kind of\noperating efficiency targets that we've said as well, and we intend to deliver on those things that reflect the\nbending of that curve through all of those drivers that we've mentioned.\nSo, I hope that helps, Erika. I appreciate the focus on both capital and expenses. We are equally focused on\nit and know just how important it is to achieving those targets. We're not only kind of doing the things that\nwe've highlighted in that strategy articulation, but we're also being responsive to the current environment\nthat we're in. We think that aids in our ability to deliver the targets and the bending of the curve, and we know\nthere's an additional opportunity that Jane has referenced to the simplification of the organization as we\nmake -- what I would argue is considerable progress on the exits towards the end of this year.

They too are looking at the efficiency of their organizations and opportunity to\nincrease that efficiency in light of a potential slowdown or recessionary environment.

You've seen that shift over the last number of quarters to last quarter where that\nestimate for IRE was about $1.7 billion or so, but heavily skewed towards non-U.S. dollar rates and\ncurrencies.\nAnd I think as we think about the view on how rates will evolve, you'll see a continued shift there. I think that\nthat when we look to print this quarter, number will probably come down a bit in terms of interest rate\nexposure and skew even more towards non-U.S. dollar currencies in light of where rates are in those markets\nand the U.S. dollar will likely be somewhat neutral in light of that curve currently looks like.
