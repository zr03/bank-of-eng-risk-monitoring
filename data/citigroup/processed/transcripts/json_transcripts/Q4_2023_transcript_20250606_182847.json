      "paragraph": "Thank you, Jenn, and a very happy New Year to everyone. I hope you all had a good break.\nAt Citi, we are back at it. Given the notable items, and our new financial reporting structure, we have a lot\nto cover today so I right to it.\n2023 was a foundational year in which we made substantial progress simplifying Citi and executing the\nstrategy we laid out at Investor Day. With that said the fourth quarter was clearly very disappointing. Today\nI will provide a high-level view on our progress in 2023, discuss our Q4 results, and finish with our priorities\nfor 2024. We know 2024 is critical as we prepare to enter the next phase of our journey and we are\ncompletely focused on delivering our medium-term targets and our transformation.\nSo, turning to what we accomplished in terms of executing our strategy. As you can see on slide 5, in 2023,\nwe saw a record year for Services, where we maintained our #1 ranking among large institutions in TTS with\nclient wins up 27% and a sustained win/loss rate above 80%. We have now gained over 100bps in share in\nSecurities Services since 2021. In Wealth, we added an estimated $21 billion in net new assets during the\nyear. In USPB we enjoyed our sixth consecutive quarter of growth, and we began to see the early fruits of\nour investments in key talent in Banking.\nIn September, we began the most consequential series of changes to the organization and the running of\nour firm since the aftermath of the financial crisis. We restructured around five core, interconnected\nbusinesses to align our organization to our business strategy and to provide greater transparency into their\nperformance. You now can see in our financials the full-year returns and P&L by business. While they are\nall impacted by investments and Transformation expense, it is clear where we have work to do. The\nsimplification of our organization structure will conclude at the end of Q1 and will result in over $1 billion of\nrun-rate saves from the net elimination of approximately five thousand roles, mainly managers.

Realizing the synergies\nbetween our five businesses is one of the key drivers to achieving our medium-term revenue targets. With\nthis new structure, I am holding my business leaders accountable for enhancing connectivity across clients\nand products. In addition, having a Chief Client Officer acts to ensure we are disciplined in bringing the full\npower of our franchise to our clients.\nWe have now completed the divestitures of 9 of our 14 international consumer franchises and have wound\ndown nearly 70% of our total retail loans and deposits in Russia, Korea and China. We have restarted the\nsales process in Poland and are well down the execution path for the Mexico IPO next year. We are exiting\nmarginal businesses such as Munis and a subset of distressed debt trading to focus on our core strengths\nand allocate our capital with rigor.\nWithout doubt, all these changes are difficult, but they are necessary. At the same time, we continued to\ninvest in our Transformation, risk and control environment and data architecture. We were pleased to have\nclosed the FX consent order with the Federal Reserve. We are committed to fulfilling the expectations of\nour regulators given the unique role we play in the global financial system. The modernization of our tech\ninfrastructure is proceeding at pace allowing us to deliver new capabilities to our clients. During the year,\nwe consolidated trading and reporting platforms, and retired 6% of our legacy applications for the second\nyear in a row. These enhancements dovetail with significant investments in our businesses, such as hiring\ncommercial bankers to capture share, improving the digital payment capabilities we offer throughout our\nglobal network, and automating processes for our Securities Services clients. It was also a year where we\nupgraded talent with key internal promotions supplemented by selective external hires, including Andy\nSieg. The simplified reporting structure has been embraced by colleagues who feel empowered by the new\nstructure to serve clients and drive value for shareholders.\nEarlier this week we disclosed additional external headwinds some of\nwhich materialized in the second half of December including a $1.3 billion reserve build related to transfer\nrisk stemming from exposures to Argentina and Russia.\nWe also saw a nearly $900 million negative revenue impact as a result of the larger than expected\ndevaluation of the Argentine currency. These items, together with the $1.7 billion FDIC assessment, drove\nthis quarter to a negative EPS of $1.16. While these items are clearly very painful, they are quite\nIn terms of the performance of our five\nbusinesses, while Services was the most impacted by the Argentine devaluation, the underlying growth\nremains very strong, driven by share gains and client wins. Overall, Services revenues were up 16% for the\nfull year despite the impact of the Argentine devaluation. In TTS, cross-border transactions were up 15%\nand AUC/AUA in Securities Services were up by close to $3 trillion for the year. In Markets, our Fixed Income\nresults were disappointing as we saw a significant slowdown in December particularly in Rates and FX.\nMarkets was also impacted by the Argentine devaluation. This franchise is well-positioned with our\ncorporate clients and we continue to take actions to improve returns, whether by redeploying capital to\nhigh-return\nWe had a decent quarter in Equities, particularly in derivatives, and saw growth in prime balances, an area\nwe have been focusing on. While activity picked up in the fourth quarter with revenues up 22%, overall\nBanking revenue continued to be impacted by a weak wallet globally.

The FDIC special assessment of\napproximately $1.7 billion related to the regional bank failures in March. This impacted expenses in All\nOther. A restructuring charge of approximately $780 million related to actions associated with our\norganizational simplification, which will drive headcount reductions and future savings over the medium-\nterm, impacted expenses in All Other. The impact of the currency devaluation in Argentina of approximately\n$880 million. This was recorded in non-interest revenue across Services, Markets and Banking and you can\nsee the impact by business in the appendix of the presentation.\nWhile we did have an adverse impact from the Argentina devaluation this quarter, we also benefitted from\nhigh interest rates, earning approximately $250 million of NII on the net investment in the quarter, given\nthe hyperinflationary environment. And a reserve build of $1.3 billion related to increases in transfer risk\nassociated with exposures to Russia and Argentina as described in the 8K. This impact is mostly included\nin other provisions in cost of credit and spans multiple businesses due to their globality. The combination\nof these items negatively impacted diluted EPS by approximately $2.00 and RoTCE by approximately 920\nbasis points.\nNow turning to the left side of the slide, where we show our financial results for the full firm. In the fourth\nquarter, we reported a net loss of $1.8 billion and a net loss per share of $1.16 on $17.4 billion of revenues.\nExcluding the notable items, diluted EPS would have been $0.84 with an RoTCE of 4.1% for the quarter. In\nthe quarter, total revenues decreased by 3% on a reported basis. Excluding divestiture-related impacts and\nthe impact of the Argentina devaluation, revenues increased 2%, driven by strength across Services, USPB,\nand Investment Banking, partially offset by lower revenues in Markets and Wealth and the revenue\nreduction from the closed exits and wind-downs.\nTurning to expenses, we reported expenses of $16.0 billion, which include the FDIC special assessment and\nmodest divestiture-related costs. Excluding these items, expenses increased 10% to $14.2 billion, largely\ndriven by the restructuring charge I just mentioned. Cost of credit was approximately $3.5 billion. Excluding\nthe reserve build for transfer risk, cost of credit was primarily driven by Card net credit losses, which are\nnow at pre-covid levels, as well as ACL builds for new card volumes. At the end of the quarter, we had nearly\n$22 billion in total reserves with a reserve-to-funded loans ratio of approximately 2.7%. And on a full-year\nbasis, we delivered $9.2 billion of net income and an RoTCE of 4.9%. Adjusting for the notable items, net\nincome was approximately $13.1 billion with an RoTCE of 7.3%.\nOn slide 8, we show full year revenue trends by business from 2021 to 2023. It is important to highlight that\nin conjunction with the change to align with our new financial reporting structure, we moved the majority\nof the Financing & Securitization business from Banking to Markets. We also implemented a revenue\nsharing arrangement within Banking, and between Banking, Services and Markets to reflect the benefit the\nbusinesses get from our relationship-based lending. These changes are now reflected in our results and our\nhistorical financials.\nNow looking at the full year numbers. Services had a record year with revenues of $18.1 billion, up 16%,\nbenefiting from both rates and business actions, new client wins and deepening with existing clients,\npartially offset by the Argentina devaluation. Markets revenues decreased 6% to $18.9 billion, largely driven\nby lower volatility and a significant slowdown in December. The Markets business was also impacted by\nthe Argentina devaluation.\nBanking revenues decreased 15% to $4.6 billion, primarily driven by the mark-to-market on loan hedges,\nas well as a decrease in corporate lending. Investment Banking revenues were relatively flat for the year as\nwe gained share amidst a declining wallet. Corporate Lending revenues were down 4%, excluding mark-to-\nmarket on loan hedges. Wealth revenues decreased 5% to $7.1 billion, primarily due to the deposit mix shift\nCopyright Â© 2024 Citigroup Inc. 4",

Excluding the FDIC special assessment\nand divestiture-related impacts, full-year expenses were $54.3 billion for 2023, in line with our guidance.\nAs I mentioned, this includes roughly $780 million of restructuring costs associated with our organizational\nsimplification and additional severance costs of approximately $730 million, which included actions to\naddress stranded costs and start to right size the businesses.\nRelative to the prior year, expense growth continued to be driven by Transformation and business-led\ninvestments, volume-related expenses and other investments in risk and controls and technology, partially\noffset by productivity savings and a reduction in expenses in Legacy Franchises, within All Other. Over the\nperformance\nof the firm but also the businesses.\nOn slide 10, we show the components of our transformation and technology spend from 2021 to 2023. Over\nthe past three years, we have invested significantly in our infrastructure, platforms, applications, processes\nand data. And as you can see in the bar chart, at the top of the slide, roughly 30% of our Transformation\ninvestments over the last three years were in technology, with the remainder related to non-tech employees\nand consultants.\ne seen a shift from consulting expenses to technology and compensation as we have gotten\ndeeper into the execution of our Transformation And you should expect to see this trend continue In total,\nwe invested over $12 billion in technology in 2023. Beyond transformation, our technology investments are\nalso focused on digital innovation, new product development, client experience enhancements and areas\nthat support our infrastructure like cloud and cyber.\nOn slide 11, we show key consumer and corporate credit metrics. Across Branded Cards and Retail Services\napproximately 80% of our card loans are to consumers with FICO scores of 680 or higher. And across both\nportfolios, NCL rates have reached pre-covid levels but we continue to be well reserved with a reserve to\nfunded loan ratio of 7.7%. In our Corporate portfolio, the majority of our exposure is investment grade which\nis reflected in our low level of non-accrual loans, at 63 basis points of total corporate loans.

As it relates to Russia, we have also included a slide in the appendix.

We maintain a very\nstrong $2.4 trillion balance sheet which is funded in part by a well-diversified $1.3 trillion deposit base\nwhich is deployed into high-quality, diversified assets.

We have approximately $561 billion of HQLA and\napproximately $690 billion of loans and we maintain total liquidity resources of $965 billion. Our LCR\ndecreased modestly to 116%. And our tangible book value per share was $86.19, up 6%.\nOn the bottom left corner of the slide, we show a full year CET1 walk to provide more detail on the drivers in\n2023. First, we generated $8.0 billion of net income to common, which added 70 basis points. Second, we\nreturned $6.1 billion in the form of common dividends and share repurchases, which drove a reduction of\nabout 53 basis points. Third, we benefitted from the impact of lower rates on our AFS investment portfolio,\nwhich drove an increase of 20 basis points. And finally, the remaining 3 basis points was largely driven by\nhigher RWA, partially offset by capital releases from the exit markets. We ended the quarter with a 13.3%\nCET1 capital ratio, approximately 100 basis points above our regulatory capital requirement of 12.3%. As\nyou can see, we have grown our CET1 ratio by approximately 30 basis points over the course of the year\nwhile returning over $6 billion to shareholders in common dividends and repurchases.\nBefore I take you through each business, as Jane mentioned, we are not satisfied with the performance and\nreturns of our businesses and therefore we are laser focused on executing against our strategy, simplifying\nthe organization and right sizing the expense base. As a reminder the investments that we have been\nmaking have impacted each of the businesses as you will see in the next few slides.\nSo now turning to slide 13, where we show the results for Services for the fourth quarter and the full year.\nRevenues were up 6% this quarter, largely driven by NII across TTS and Securities Services, partially offset\nby NIR driven by the Argentina devaluation. Services non-interest revenues were up 20% excluding the\nimpact of the Argentina devaluation. Expenses increased 9%, primarily driven by continued investments in\ntechnology, product innovation and client experience. Cost of credit was $646 million, driven by a reserve\nbuild of approximately $652 million, primarily associated with transfer risk in Russia and Argentina. Net\nincome decreased to $776 million, as higher revenues were more than offset by higher cost of credit and\nhigher expenses. Average loans were up 6%, primarily driven by strong demand for working capital loans in\nTTS, both in North America and internationally. Average deposits were down 3% as the impact of\nquantitative tightening more than offset new client acquisitions and deepening with existing clients,\nhowever sequentially, deposits were up 1%. Services delivered an RoTCE of 13.4% for the quarter. And for\nthe full year, Services delivered an RoTCE of 20% on $18.1 billion of revenues.\nOn slide 14, we show the results for Markets for the fourth quarter and the full year. Markets revenues were\ndown 19%, versus a strong quarter last year, driven by a decline in fixed income and the impact of the\ndevaluation, partially offset by an increase in equities. Fixed Income revenues decreased by 25%, largely\ndriven by rates and currencies on lower volatility and a significant slowdown in December as well as the\nimpact of devaluation. However, we saw good underlying momentum in equities, with revenues up 9%,\ndriven by gains across all products. And we continued to grow prime balances while making solid progress\non our revenue-to-RWA target. Expenses increased 8%, driven by investments in transformation and risk\nand controls and volume related costs, partially offset by productivity savings. Cost of credit was $209\nmillion, driven by a reserve build of approximately $179 million, primarily associated with the transfer risk\nin Russia and Argentina. Markets reported a net loss of $134 million, as revenues were more than offset by\nhigher expenses and higher cost of credit. Average loans increased 4% to $115 billion, as we saw increased\nclient demand for credit driving growth in warehouse lending. Average trading assets increased 18% to\n$391 billion, largely driven by treasuries and mortgage-backed securities, given the strong client activity in\nfixed income for much of the year. While it was a challenging quarter, Markets performed relatively well for\nthe full year with revenue of $18.9 billion and an RoTCE of 7.4%, compared with very strong performance in\nthe prior year. And we are focused on improving returns over time through a combination of revenue growth,\nexpense discipline, and capital optimization.\nOn slide 15, we show the results for Banking for the fourth quarter and the full year.

Investment banking revenues increased 27% YoY, driven by\nDCM and Advisory due to improvements in market sentiment. In Advisory, we saw signs of strength across\nTechnology, Healthcare and Energy, and we feel good about the strength of our pipeline. Corporate Lending\nrevenues excluding mark-to-market on loan hedges decreased 26%, largely driven by lower revenue share\nfrom Investment Banking, Services and Markets. Expenses increased 37%, primarily driven by the absence\nof an operational loss reserve release in the prior year. Excluding the reserve release, expenses were roughly\nflat. Cost of credit was $185 million, driven by a reserve build associated with the transfer risk in Russia and\nArgentina. The NCL rate was 32 basis points of average loans and we ended the quarter with a reserve to\nfunded loan ratio of 1.6%. Banking reported a net loss of $322 million as higher expenses and cost of credit\nmore than offset higher revenues. RoTCE was negative 6.0% for the quarter. And for the full year, Banking\nreported an RoTCE of negative 0.2% on $4.6 billion of revenues. So clearly, we have more work to do on\ncapitalize on the rebound in the market wallet. And that includes continuing to invest in key growth areas,\nupgrading talent in traditional sectors, and continuing to right size the business.\nOn slide 16, we show the results for Wealth for the fourth quarter and the full year. Wealth revenues\ndecreased 3%, driven by lower deposit spreads, partially offset by lower mortgage funding cost and higher\n-interest revenue, which was up 13% in the\nfourth quarter, driven by higher investment assets, increased client activity and market performance.\nExpenses were up 4%, primarily driven by investments in risk and controls and technology, partially offset\nby re-pacing strategic investments and tighter expense control as we begin to right size the expense base\nin the business. Wealth reported net income of $5 million, as revenues were mostly offset by higher\nexpenses. Client balances increased 6%, primarily driven by higher client investment assets, partially offset\nby lower deposit balances. Average loans were flat, as we continued to optimize capital usage. Average\ndeposits decreased 2%, reflecting the continued mix shift of deposits to higher-yielding investments on\nClient investment assets were up 12%, driven by new acquisitions and the benefit from\nhigher market valuations. good momentum in net new assets, which more than doubled\nto $16 billion for the quarter. For the full year, we added an estimated $21 billion in net new assets. RoTCE\nwas 0.1% for the quarter. And for the full year, RoTCE was 2.6% on $7.1 billion of revenues. Looking ahead,\nstrategy to drive investment revenue with an eye toward right sizing the expense base. We will wind down\nnon-core initiatives, exit less productive performers and enhance discipline across every expense line.\nOn slide 17, we show the results for US Personal Banking for the fourth quarter and the full year. US Personal\nBanking revenues increased 12%. Branded Cards revenues increased 10%, driven by higher net interest\nmargin and interest-earning balance growth of 13%. And we continue to see healthy growth in new account\nacquisitions, up 8% and spend volumes up 3%. Retail Services revenues increased 15%, also driven by\nhigher net interest margin and interest-earning balance growth of 11%, as well as lower partner payments\ndue to higher net credit losses. Retail Banking revenues increased 15%, driven by higher deposit spreads,\nloan growth and improved mortgage margins. Expenses decreased 1%, as higher expenses to support\nlending programs and client engagement, as well as the rollout of Simplified Banking were offset by lower\nnon-volume related expenses. Cost of credit of $2.1 billion increased 20%, driven by higher NCLs, partially\noffset by a lower ACL build. Net income increased to $201 million, driven by higher revenues, partially offset\nby higher cost of credit. Average deposits decreased 5%, driven by the transfer of relationships and the\nassociated deposits to our Wealth business. We continued to make progress against our digital strategy,\nwith digital deposits up 14% and active digital users increasing 6%. RoTCE for the quarter was 3.6%. And\nfor the full year, US Personal Banking delivered an ROTCE of 8.3% on $19.2 billion of revenue. Here again,\nwe are focused on improving the return profile of the business, managing through this part of the credit\ncycle and continuing to make progress in Retail Banking will be key.\nOn slide 18, we show results for All Other on a managed basis, which includes Corporate Other and Legacy\nFranchises and excludes divestiture-related items.

And on the right side of the slide, we list the key drivers.\nIn TTS, we expect revenue growth to be driven by new client wins, deepening with our existing clients and\ncontinued momentum with Commercial Clients as we continue to leverage our global footprint and product\ninnovations. In Securities Services, we have a very healthy pipeline and will continue to onboard assets\nunder custody from new mandates, win new clients and deepen relationships with existing clients. In\nInvestment Banking we anticipate a rebound in activity and to maintain our position as the wallet recovers.\ntechnology, to allow us to gain share. And we also expect a modest rebound in Wealth, as we execute on\nour refocused strategy with an eye towards growing investment fees, particularly with our existing clients.\nIn USPB, we expect continued growth in cards balances driven by the investments we have been making as\nwell as lower partner payments in retail services to continue to drive revenue growth. We also expect to\ncontinue to improve our retail branch performance. And as it relates to NII, excluding Markets, we expect\nnet interest income to be down modestly as the volume growth we expect from loans and deposits is more\nthan offset by lower US rates and the reduction from the closed exits and wind-downs.\nTurning to slide 21, we expect expenses to be approximately $53.5 to $53.8 billion, down from $54.3\nbillion, subject to volume-related expenses. The decrease in expenses will be driven by the benefits of our\norganizational simplification, a continued reduction from exit markets and wind-downs, and productivity\nsavings, partially offset by investments in risk and controls and volume-related expenses. Embedded in\nthis guidance includes an elevated level of severance, as well as additional potential costs related to the\norganizational simplification totaling approximately $700 million to $1 billion. This will contribute to\nreducing headcount over 2024 and the medium term, which we will discuss on the next slide.\nOn slide 22, we show the drivers of headcount and expense reduction over the medium-term.\ndiscussed in the past, there are three drivers that will reduce our expenses. Organizational simplification\nincluding the reduction of management layers. Eliminating stranded costs as we take additional actions to\nreduce excess overhead in light of the exit markets. And realizing productivity savings from our investments\nin the transformation and technology. We expect the combination of these three drivers to reduce our\nheadcount by a net 20 thousand, excluding Mexico, and generate a net run rate save of $2 to $2.5 billion\nover the medium term. This will underpin our path to $51 to $53 billion of expenses, subject to volume-\nrelated expenses. Both the headcount and expense reduction will allow us to right size the firm and\nbusinesses to improve performance and returns.\nOn slide 23, we show our outlook for U.S. Cards in 2024. In terms of credit performance, based on the\nabove pre-COVID levels and peak in 2024. On a full-year basis for 2024, we expect the Branded Cards NCL\nrate to be in the range of 3.5% to 4.0% and the Retail Services NCL rate to be in the range of 5.75% to 6.25%.\nFrom an allowance perspective, we are reserved for a weighted 8-quarter average unemployment rate of\nalmost 5.0%, which imbeds a downside scenario of approximately 6.8%. ACL builds in 2024 will primarily\nbe a function of the volume growth that we see as well as changes in the macro scenarios and the\nprobabilities associated with them. And we expect continued momentum in cards albeit more in line with\nmid-single digit loan growth.\nOn slide 24, we summarize our medium-term targets. While a lot has changed in the macro environment\nsince Investor Day, our strategy has not, and we are on a path to the 11-12% RoTCE in the medium term,\ndriven by top line revenue growth and expense reductions.

At Investor Day, I set out a vision to be the preeminent banking partner for clients with cross\nborder needs. That vision was based on five core interconnected businesses. We set off on a deliberate path\nto get there, and over the last three years we've done so.\nPage 4 is who we are today. We are five interconnected businesses; no more, no less. We have our\norganization that now aligns with those five businesses, and this enables us to focus on two priorities. The\nfirst is improving the performance and the returns of those five core businesses, so that we can meet the\nmedium-term RoTCE target we laid out. And the second is on addressing our regulatory issues through the\ntransformation. And I would also be, I need to note that I fully recognize that 2024 is an inflection year, Mike.\nAnd I and the management team are accountable to deliver. And that you and our investors have the\ntransparency you need to hold us accountable.\nSo, why is this time different? Look, it's not lost on me that there's been many attempts in the past to change\nthis firm. I and the management are fully committed to transforming this company for the long term and we\nare addressing the issues that have held us back in the past. And you've got proof points of the last three\nyears where we've made a lot of tough decisions and we have put through a tremendous amount of change\nto get to the simple Citi that we are today. We completely reset our strategy. So, we now have a significantly\nmore focused business and operating model.\nWe've announced the most consequential set of changes to our organizational model, and frankly, from my\nperspective, more importantly, how we run the bank, since the financial crisis, aimed at simplifying the bank\nand increasing accountability. You've seen moved quickly. We're on track with our execution of this\neffort. And it will generate over $1 billion of run rate saves the end of the first quarter, purely from the\norganization efforts that we've put in that we announced in September. We've done this while investing and\nI think this is another difference. We've invested heavily in our transformation. And while that was catalyzed\nCopyright Â© 2024 Citigroup Inc. 9",

I think to your point, Jane, we've\nbeen investing in the franchise both on the front-end, and importantly, on the transformation and the risk\nand controls.

But I also highlight that we also included $780 million associated\nwith the restructuring charge. That is more than I had articulated in the way of guidance. So, the capacity\nthat we created through our efforts through the year, we use that in a smart way. We use that to fund the org\nsimplification cost, so that we can realize the savings down the line.

      "paragraph": "Yeah and I'll jump in, too. Let's maybe start with TTS. When we think about the performance\nof TTS, which, as we say, the growth this year up 19% ex-Argentina, came from a combination of both rates\nand the strong business actions we've taken. And you can see that in the different drivers. Cross-border was\nup 23%, commercial cards up 8%. In terms of the growth prospects, we've generated 22% in average revenue\ngrowth, from 21 to 23, well ahead of the Investor Day guidance we had of high-single digits. That was not just\nbecause of the rate cycle. It obviously helped. And we certainly expect to grow revenues at mid-single digit\nnow as we lap the prior periods that benefited from those rate increases, and that's going to come from a few\ndifferent areas.\nOne, the focus on our fee strategy, where we're capitalizing on strong client engagement, market-leading\nclient solutions, and we're delivering on a lot of the different growth initiatives that we've been investing in\nacross all our client segments. We'll continue optimizing our deposit book and bringing in high-quality\ndeposits. And in a lower rate environment, GDP is typically higher, so you'd expect to see some higher growth\nin our capital-efficient payment volumes.\nYou'll see us continuing to acquire new clients and deepen relationships with existing clients. And I'd point\nto our confidence here, 27% increase in our new client acquisition this year and a sustained win/loss ratio of\n82% on new deals, and that was across different client segments. And revenues from these clients just\ncontinues to ramp up, as we expand across the different geographies and product suites with them. And\nyou'll also continue to see us investing in the infrastructure and platforms we've been doing, launching new\ninnovative products. And we're seeing momentum from some of the things we've recently done: Citi Token\nServices, Payment Express, 24/7 Clearing, et cetera. So I think, the main takeaway from TTS is that we'll\ncontinue to invest in it. We expect to see strong client momentum. We've been getting consistently good\nclient feedback regarding our capabilities, so we expect to see good global growth that will certainly help as\nthe rate cycle comes down. And it is a crown jewel for a reason.\nAnd then, just quickly on Securities Services. I think where we're seeing, we mentioned, we've got a number\nof marquee wins there across all the client segments. That pipeline is both investors and issuers. And one of\nthe core strategies that Okan put in place was to grow share with the US-based asset managers. We were at\n2.6% share in 2020; we're now at 4.3%. And a lot of the growth in the pipeline has been coming, not only\nfrom our global network names, but also from the marquee players in the US asset manager space. I think\nthat's our ability to connect our capabilities that gives these players huge efficiencies for our clients.\nMark, anything I've missed there?

You have our global FX network, where we're typically\nnumber one in any year, just given the strength, and particularly, the corporate client base we've set off.\nRates, typically top three. Together, these are two of the largest macro pools within FICC.\nIn terms of the spread products, we've been putting our financing and securitization business as part of our\nsimplification, fully within Markets, so that we've created a unified, scaled spreads product business. And\nthen finally, equities, where we're focused on improving our prime offering, building balances. We still have\na way to go obviously in that. Prime balances we're pleased they were nicely up this year, driven by client\nmomentum. And we're a leading equities derivative franchise. So, you do have these four core businesses.\nAnd I'd go back to our big point of differentiation and why we feel we're well-positioned. We have a very\ndifferentiated corporate client base and very strong partnerships between our core Markets franchise, TTS,\nand Banking and Securities Services, and that helps us in FX, in commodities and in rates around the world.\nSo, Markets is important both in terms of its leadership, but also, how it fits into the strengths that we have\nfrom this simpler Citi of those five core interconnected businesses.\nWe've demonstrated solid returns in the past.

So, that means we hold long-term\ncapital in those countries, upon which we generate solid returns through the cycle. And let me just point to\nour leading Services and FX businesses are the heart of that network, and they're generating double-digits,\nas you can see.\nWith that footprint comes a set of risks. So, I think of it in terms of credit, currency, transferability of capital.\nAnd we've proven our ability to manage those risks consistently over a long period of time. And with respect\nto the Q4 currency and transfer items, while the timing was unknown and we've highlighted those risks in\nour disclosures for a couple of years, I'd say, Russia is rather unique. It's a war, and for us, a highly unusual\nliquidation. We've navigated it very well. We've executed our wind-down in an orderly way with very low\nlosses for our clients and very low losses for us. Our remaining net assets are now 100% reserved against.\nAnd I think similarly, if I just touch on Argentina for a minute, because I'm sure, folks have got a few questions\non that. Similarly, over the last several years, we've de-risked our business model there. We don't have a\nconsumer bank, so we've really reduced down our emerging markets exposures to just our institutional\npresence, focused on the multinational clients, you've heard us talk about that, and select high-grade local\nclients.\nIf you look at Argentina, it's a very good business for us over the cycle. And even after the impacts of Q4, we\nhad less than $5 million in credit losses in Argentina over a 10-year period. That's remarkable, $5 million over\n10 years. In terms of the currency risk, we all have to book revenues, the official rate versus the parallel market\nrate. We are able to partially but not fully hedge the exposure, but we would certainly always take economic\ndecisions on the business we do and did mindful of likely devaluations and capital controls.

And essentially, what's left is that we have a custody business and we're holding corporate dividends\nthat are our clients' proceeds were unable to pay those out by law, by regulation, and so we have to hold\nthose and so that's what's being referenced in the slide when we say unremittable Russia corporate\ndividends. And so, that is not a risk of loss for us, but we're unable to kind of clear those because of the state\nof play in Russia at this stage.\nOkay, that was clear. And then, just separately in credit cards. You and a lot of your peers\nexpect losses to go up from here, but most of you are saying, they're going to peak at this year, including you.\nJust what gives you confidence that the card losses will peak this year is it just getting back to that a little bit\nof a normalized level? Is it some tightening that you've done? What's driving that confidence, looking out this\nyear? Because you're probably seeing a step-up coming still, right?",

What I'd point out is, you can\nsee actually on the slide how there was a dip in loss rates during the COVID period. And so to some extent,\nwhat we're seeing is kind of a catch up of those, as those portfolios go through a longer maturation than what\nyou'd normally see in a cards portfolio.\nOn top of that, we've been originating new card. You've noticed our acquisitions have grown, so we obviously\nhave new card loans, and those are going through a much normal maturation period. And so, as we look at\nthe early buckets and the delinquencies that are playing out, we've got a pretty good sense for when we\nwould expect those to peak and at what level. And we think they'll peak inside of 2024, so that's captured in\nthat average forecast that we've given.\nWe haven't made material changes to our underwriting.

For a 100 basis point move in a parallel shift,\nwe're looking at probably a negative $1.6 billion or so, but important to point out that the US dollar\ncomponent of that is only a couple hundred million dollars. Similarly, if rates moved in the other way, positive\nof 100 basis points, there'd be a small movement as it relates to US dollar exposure. So our US dollar\nexposure is relatively neutral, again, assuming a static balance sheet, a parallel shift in the curve.

So when I think about that effort, it will close at the end of the first\nquarter, as we said. We're expecting to get about $1 billion of run rate save from the org simplification work\nalone. That constitutes about 5,000 heads. We're just about to, at the end of this month, finish Phase 3,\nwhich will mean the first four layers of the organization have been addressed. That's been a net reduction of\nabout 1,500 managers out of a total of 12,000 roles. There's about 13%, and these are mainly manager roles,\nas I talked about earlier.\nThen, when we think about where are other expense opportunities on top of this, as Mark was talking about\nearlier, the stranded costs, we'll be completing the elimination of the stranded costs from the divestitures.\nWe'll be continuing, and you've seen us been continuing that, exiting marginal businesses and hobbies and\nthe like and being very disciplined about that.\nWe've got some businesses where we feel we need to right size the core expense base. Andy Sieg is going to\nbe kicking off that in Wealth, and you'll begin to see some of the impact of that in the first quarter. He's off to\na strong start. And then, we've got others where we'll be creating more utilities. We've still got different\nfragmented activities across the firm that the organization simplification has highlighted. We'll be\naggregating those, creating utilities, or are consolidating some of those different functions. And that is\nbefore we get to, beginning to get benefits from the transformation, where there'll be efficiencies that come\nthrough.\nWe'll still have areas that we're investing. These are going to be, as we talked about, core business\ninvestments. It's going to be expense growth still in the top, from volume growth that we've got. And we will\nbe investing in our transformation. And all of this is happening over the medium term to get us to the 11% to\n12% RoTCE target we talked about.\nSo that 20,000, it's the number that we estimate of the headcount. I don't love thinking headcount. I like\nthinking about expenses. I think it's a more meaningful number. So as Mark laid out in his presentation, we've\ngot a net expense save that we're expecting to achieve from the medium term.
