4Q 2023 Financial Overview Highlights
• Revenues Decreased (3)% YoY (down (2)% ex-divestiture-related impacts(5)),
driven by Argentina devaluation impact (also generated NII from our net
investment in Argentina), lower volatility in Markets and slow recovery in both IB
and Wealth, partially offset by continued momentum in Services and cards
• Expenses Up 23% YoY, primarily driven by the FDIC special assessment and
the restructuring charge (up 10% ex-divestiture-related impacts and FDIC(6))
• Credit Costs $3.5B, including a $1.3B ACL build associated with transfer risk in
Russia and Argentina and higher Card NCLs that are now at pre-Covid levels
• Net Income $(1.8)B, as higher expenses and cost of credit more than offset the
lower revenues

Financial Results Highlights
• Revenues Up 22% YoY, driven by growth in Investment Banking revenues
(up 27%) and lower losses on loan hedges, partially offset by Corporate
Lending (down (26)%) and impact from the Argentina currency devaluation
• Expenses Up 37% YoY, primarily driven by the absence of an operational
loss reserve release in the prior year
• Credit Costs Cost of $185 million, primarily driven by a net reserve build
associated with the transfer risk in Russia and Argentina
• Net Income Loss of $(322) million driven by higher expenses as well as cost
of credit, partially offset by higher revenues
• RoTCE(4) of (6.0)%
• FY RoTCE(4) of (0.2)%

Financial Results Highlights
• Revenues Down (3)% YoY, driven by lower deposit spreads, partially offset
by lower mortgage funding cost and higher investment fee revenues
• Expenses Up 4% YoY, primarily driven by investments in risk and controls
and technology, partially offset by re-pacing strategic investments and tighter
expense control as we begin to right size the expense base in the business
• Credit Costs Cost of $4 million, driven by NCLs of $31 million, partially offset
by an ACL release of $(27) million
• Net Income $5 million, reflecting lower revenues and higher expenses
• RoTCE(3) of 0.1%
• FY RoTCE(3) of 2.6%

U.S. Personal Banking results, key metrics and statistics
Financial Results Highlights
• Revenues Up 12% YoY, driven by an increase in NII on loan growth in cards
and higher deposit spreads
• Expenses Down (1)%, primarily driven by risk and control and business-led
investments, more than offset by lower non-volume related expenses
• Credit Costs Cost of $2.1 billion, driven by NCLs of $1.6 billion reflecting a
return of loss rates to pre-Covid levels and an ACL build of $0.5 billion
• Net Income $201 million, driven by higher revenues and lower expenses,
partially offset by higher cost of credit
• RoTCE(3) of 3.6%
• FY RoTCE(3) of 8.3%

Update
• Citi has operated in Argentina for over 100 years and currently serves approximately 1,300 clients, including 700 multinational clients (MNC)
• Generally, we support these clients in Argentina as part of a broader institutional relationship which spans many other countries around the world
• The primary activities we engage in with clients in Argentina are liquidity management, payments and custody within Services
• 80% of total assets consist of cash, reverse repos and securities. Additionally, there are approximately $400 million of loans, half of which are fully-guaranteed by
the parent of the obligor. Aggregate net credit losses on corporate loans were $4 million over the last 10 years
• Citi also has a cumulative translation adjustment (CTA) loss balance of approximately $2.5 billion(1) which is only recognizable in earnings upon either the substantial
liquidation or a loss of control of the entity (Capital neutral)

‒ 3Q23 YTD: $1.2B Other net income exceeded $1.0B devaluation impact
• During 4Q23:
‒ Argentina significantly devalued its peso to ARS 808 per USD hence a
$0.9B translation loss in Other Revenue, partially offset by $0.5B in Other
Net income
‒ Citi built $0.5B transfer risk reserves for onshore exposures associated
with its net investment plus $0.2B for cross-border exposures outside
Argentina, driven by safety and soundness considerations under U.S.
