Services results, key metrics and statistics
Financial Results 4Q Highlights
• Revenues – Up 15% YoY, driven by a smaller impact from the Argentina currency
devaluation and continued momentum in Securities Services and TTS.
Excluding the impact of the Argentina currency devaluation, revenues increased
3%(4)
‒ NII flat YoY, as the benefit of higher deposit volumes was offset by a decline
in interest rates in Argentina
‒ NIR increased 61%, driven by a smaller impact from the Argentina currency
devaluation versus the prior year and continued strength across underlying
fee drivers. Excluding the impact of the Argentina currency devaluation, NIR
increased 8%(5)
• Expenses – Up 1% YoY, driven by continued investment in technology and
platform modernization, partially offset by productivity savings
• Delivered positive operating leverage
• Credit Costs – Cost of $112 million, largely driven by an ACL build of $84 million
• Net Income – $1.9 billion
• RoTCE(3) of 29.9%; FY RoTCE(3) of 26.0%

Financial Results 4Q Highlights
• Revenues – Up 27% YoY, largely driven by growth in Investment Banking
− Investment Banking revenues were up 35% YoY and fees were up
35% YoY, with increases across ECM, DCM and Advisory
− Corporate Lending (ex-gain/(loss) on loan hedges(1)) down (24)% YoY,
primarily driven by lower revenue share and volumes, partially offset
by a smaller impact from the Argentina currency devaluation
• Expenses – Down (9)% YoY, primarily driven by benefits from prior
repositioning and other actions taken to right-size the expense base, partially
offset by volume-related expenses
• Delivered positive operating leverage
• Credit Costs – Benefit of $240 million, driven by an ACL release of $247
million, primarily reflecting improved macroeconomic conditions
• Net Income – $356 million
• RoTCE(4) of 6.5%; FY RoTCE(4) of 7.0%

• Citi has operated in Argentina for over 110 years and currently serves approximately 1,300 clients, including approximately 700 multinational clients
• Generally, Citi supports these clients in Argentina as part of a broader institutional relationship which spans many other countries around the world
• The primary activities Citi engages in with clients in Argentina are liquidity management, payments and custody within Services
• Citi’s net investment increased to $1.5 billion in 4Q24, primarily driven by income from operations and a release of a transfer risk reserve, partially offset
by capital repatriation
• During 2024, Citi’s net investment in Argentina was impacted by:
‒ Earnings from Citibank Argentina’s normal onshore operations and interest income earned on the net investment
‒ A $0.2 billion reserve release, driven by a decrease in transfer risk for safety and soundness considerations under U.S. banking law
‒ Further Argentina currency devaluation, albeit less severe than in the prior year, resulting in a net devaluation loss of ($0.2) billion
‒ A return of approximately $0.4 billion of excess capital through dividends to Citibank Argentina’s parent entity

31,main_text,"Update on Russia exposure and net investment
• Citi ended nearly all of the institutional banking services offered in Russia as of March 31, 2023
• Largely completed wind-downs of Citi’s consumer and local commercial banking businesses
• Remaining services are only those necessary to fulfill our remaining legal and regulatory obligations
• Russia exposure decreased by approximately $0.1 billion during 4Q24 from the previous quarter due to further ruble depreciation, largely offset by net
increases in Russia unremittable corporate dividends in Services
• Of the $9.0 billion exposure as of December 31, 2024, approximately $7.4 billion or 82% was unremittable corporate dividends
• Net investment in the Russian entity decreased by $0.2 billion during 4Q24 to a nominal amount, largely driven by a reserve build in the quarter due to
an increase in transfer risk for safety and soundness considerations under U.S. banking law
• Citi has a cumulative translation adjustment (CTA) loss balance of approximately $1.6 billion(1) related to its Russian subsidiary, which is only
recognizable in Citi’s earnings upon either the substantial liquidation or a loss of control of the entity (capital neutral)
• Additionally, if a loss of control of the entity was to occur, then Citi would also recognize a loss of $0.9 billion on intercompany liabilities currently owed
by its Russian entity

1) 2024 operating expenses excluding the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) special assessment is a non-GAAP financial measure. In the second and third quarter 2024 earnings
presentations, Citi reported a non-GAAP financial measure that reflected the estimated 2024 operating expense excluding the FDIC special assessment and the Civil Money Penalties imposed by the
FRB and OCC in July 2024. Citi also communicated its intent to absorb the Civil Money Penalties within the estimated 2024 operating expense guidance that originally had been communicated at the
beginning of 2024, which Citi has achieved. Accordingly, Citi is reporting 2024 operating expenses excluding the FDIC special assessment only and including the impact of the $136 million Civil
Money Penalties to illustrate its progress in reducing operating expenses. For a reconciliation of these results, please refer to Slide 35.
2) Efficiency ratio excluding the FDIC special assessment is a non-GAAP financial measure. For a reconciliation to reported results, please refer to Slide 35.
3) Return on Tangible Common Equity (RoTCE) is a non-GAAP financial measure. RoTCE represents annualized net income available to common shareholders as a percentage of average TCE. For a

4) On January 13, 2025, Citigroup’s Board of Directors authorized a new, multi-year $20 billion common stock repurchase program, beginning in the first quarter 2025. Repurchases by Citigroup under
this common stock repurchase program are subject to quarterly approval by Citigroup’s Board of Directors; may be effected from time to time through open market purchases, trading plans
established in accordance with U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission rules, or other means; and as determined by Citigroup, may be subject to satisfactory market conditions, Citigroup’s capital
position and capital requirements, applicable legal requirements and other factors.

1) As previously disclosed, fourth quarter 2023 results included several notable pre-tax items consisting of: (i) an approximately $1.7 billion charge to operating expenses related to the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corporation (FDIC) special assessment; (ii) an approximately $1.3 billion net ACL reserve build driven by increases in transfer risk associated with exposures in Russia and Argentina, driven
by safety and soundness considerations under U.S. banking law; (iii) an $(880) million revenue impact from the Argentina currency devaluation; and (iv) an approximately $781 million restructuring
charge, recorded in operating expenses. In total, the items had a pre-tax impact of $(4.7) billion and an after-tax impact of $(3.8) billion in the fourth quarter of 2023 and negatively impacted diluted
EPS by approximately $2.00 and RoTCE of 9.2%, reducing RoTCE from 4.1% to (5.1)%. Results of operation excluding the impact of these notables items are non-GAAP financial measures. Fourth
quarter 2024 results included the following pre-tax items: (i) an approximately $(26) million release of accruals associated with the FDIC special assessment; (ii) an approximately $47 million net ACL
reserve build driven by an aggregate increase in transfer risk associated with exposures in Russia and Argentina, driven by safety and soundness considerations under U.S. banking law; (iii) a $(71)
million revenue impact from the currency devaluation in Argentina; and (iv) an $(11) million release of the restructuring accrual. In total, these items had a pre-tax impact of $(81) million and an after-
tax impact of $(94) million in the fourth quarter of 2024 and did not have a meaningful impact to diluted EPS or RoTCE.
2) Allowance for Credit Losses (ACL) Build (Release) and Other provisions includes a net ACL build of approximately $203 million related to loans and unfunded lending commitments as well as other
provisions of approximately $148 million relating to held-to-maturity (HTM) debt securities and other assets and policyholder benefits and claims.
3) Represents net income, less preferred stock dividends, dividends and undistributed earnings allocated to employee restricted and deferred shares with rights to dividends, and issuance costs related
to the redemption of preferred stock.
4) Return on Tangible Common Equity (RoTCE) is a non-GAAP financial measure. RoTCE represents annualized net income available to common shareholders as a percentage of average TCE. For a
