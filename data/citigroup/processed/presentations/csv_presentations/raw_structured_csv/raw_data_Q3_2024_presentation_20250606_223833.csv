Financial results overview
Financial Results 3Q24 Financial Overview Highlights
• Revenues – Up 1% YoY. Excluding divestiture-related impacts, revenues were up
3% YoY (7), driven by growth across each of our businesses
‒ Year-to-date revenues are also up 1% YoY, and excluding divestiture-
related impacts in the prior year, revenues up 3% YoY(7)
• Expenses – Down (2)% YoY, both on a reported basis and excluding divestiture-
related impacts(8), primarily driven by savings associated with the organizational
simplification and stranded cost reductions, partially offset by volume-related
expenses and continued investments in Transformation and other risk and
control initiatives
• Credit Costs – $2.7 billion, largely driven by net credit losses in cards, as well as
ACL builds across the businesses for portfolio growth and mix
‒ At the end of the quarter, Citi had over $22 billion in total reserves with a
reserve-to-funded loans ratio of approximately 2.7%.
• Net Income - $3.2 billion, down 9% YoY, primarily driven by higher cost of credit,
partially offset by higher revenues and lower expenses

Key drivers resulting in CET1 Capital ratio of 13.7%(1) • Well capitalized today with a CET1 Capital ratio of 13.7%(1), ~140bps
above the 3Q24 regulatory capital requirement, and includes a 100bps
• Strength in earnings

• Unrealized AFS gains from rates
• Decreased regulatory capital requirement:
• Mostly offset by:
ꟷ As of October 1, 2024, regulatory capital requirement decreased to
ꟷ Capital distribution in the form of common dividends and share 12.1%, driven by the Stress Capital Buffer decrease from 4.3% to

Services results, key metrics and statistics
Financial Results Highlights
• Revenues – Up 8% YoY, reflecting continued momentum across Securities
Services and TTS
‒ NII roughly flat, as the benefit of higher deposit volumes was largely
offset by a decline in interest rates in Argentina
‒ NIR increased 33%, driven by a smaller impact from currency
devaluation in Argentina as well as continued strength across
underlying fee drivers
‒ Excluding the impact of the Argentine peso devaluation, NIR increased
11%(4)
• Expenses – Up 3% YoY, primarily driven by investments in technology, other
risk and controls and product innovation, resulting in positive operating
leverage
• Credit Costs – Cost of $127 million, driven by a net ACL build of $113 million
• Net Income – $1.7 billion, up 23% YoY
• RoTCE(3) of 26.4%; Year-to-date RoTCE(3) of 24.7%

Financial Results Highlights
• Revenues – Down (18)% YoY, primarily driven by closed exits and wind-downs
as well as margin compression on mortgage securities in the investment
portfolio that have extended
• Expenses – Down (5)% YoY, as the reduction from the closed exits and wind-
downs was partially offset by a legal reserve
• Credit Costs – Cost of $289 million, largely driven by net credit losses and an
ACL build in Mexico

• Citi has operated in Argentina for over 100 years and currently serves approximately 1,300 clients, including approximately 700 multinational clients
• Generally, Citi supports these clients in Argentina as part of a broader institutional relationship which spans many other countries around the world
• The primary activities Citi engages in with clients in Argentina are liquidity management, payments and custody within Services
• In 3Q24, Citibank Argentina completed the sale of its remaining position in BCRA USD-denominated bonds, called Bonds for the Reconstruction for a
Free Argentina (BOPREAL), in the secondary market
• As a result, Citibank Argentina returned approximately $0.2 billion of excess capital through dividends to its parent entity in 3Q24, thereby reducing
future FX devaluation risk

• Citi ended nearly all of the institutional banking services offered in Russia as of March 31, 2023
• Largely completed wind-downs of Citi’s consumer and local commercial banking businesses
• Remaining services are only those necessary to fulfill our remaining legal and regulatory obligations
• Russia exposure increased by approximately $0.9 billion from the previous quarter due to net increases in Russia unremittable corporate dividends,
partially offset by ruble depreciation
• Of the $9.1 billion exposure as of September 30, 2024, approximately $7.5 billion or 82% was unremittable corporate dividends
• Net investment in the Russian entity increased by $0.1 billion during 3Q24 to $0.2 billion, largely driven by earnings on its local cash position
• Citi has a cumulative translation adjustment (CTA) loss balance of approximately $1.6 billion(1) related to its Russian subsidiary, which is only recognizable
in Citi’s earnings upon either the substantial liquidation or a loss of control of the entity (capital neutral)
• Additionally, if a loss of control of the entity were to occur, then Citi would also recognize a loss of $0.7 billion on intercompany liabilities currently owed by
its Russian entity
