ICG Revenue Items and Selected Business Drivers and Statistics
Revenues 1Q23 Highlights
Services
• Treasury and Trade Solutions revenues were up 31% YoY, driven by 41%
growth in net interest income and 13% growth in non-interest revenues,
with growth across all client segments
• Securities Services revenues up 23% YoY, driven by higher interest rates
across currencies, partially offset by lower non-interest revenues due to
the impact of market valuations
Markets
• Fixed Income revenues up 4% YoY, driven by strength in rates and
currencies, partially offset by a decline in spread products
• Equity Markets revenues down 25% YoY, reflecting reduced client
activity in cash and equity derivatives relative to a very strong quarter
last year
Banking
Key Drivers and Statistics
• Investment Banking revenues down 25% YoY, as continued geopolitical
uncertainty, heightened macroeconomic uncertainty and volatility
continued to impact client activity
• Corporate Lending(1)revenues down 14% YoY, driven by lower volume
and higher credit default swap premiums
Note: Totals may not sum due to rounding. AUC: Assets Under Custody. AUA: Assets Under Administration.

are unable to provide a reconciliation of forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures because we are unable to provide, without unreasonable effort, a meaningful or accurate
