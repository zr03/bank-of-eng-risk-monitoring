million of repositioning costs largely related to our
efficiency efforts across the firm, including the
reduction of stranded costs associated with the
consumer divestitures
The expected savings from these actions will
allow us to continue to fund additional

loan vintages that were originated over the last few years were delayed in their
maturation due to the unprecedented levels of government stimulus during
the pandemic and are now maturing

• Generally, we support these clients in Argentina as part of a broader institutional relationship which spans many other countries around the world
• The primary activities we engage in with clients in Argentina are liquidity management, payments and custody within Services
• Approximately 80% of total assets consist of cash, reverse repos and securities. Additionally, there are approximately $572 million of loans, half of which are
fully-guaranteed by the parent of the obligor. Aggregate net credit losses on corporate loans were $4 million over the last 10 years
• Citi also has a cumulative translation adjustment (CTA) loss balance of approximately $2.5 billion(1) which can only be recognized in earnings upon either the
substantial liquidation or a loss of control of the entity. This would be capital neutral

Overview
• Ended nearly all of the institutional banking services offered in Russia as of March 31, 2023
• Remaining services are only those necessary to fulfill our remaining legal and regulatory obligations
• Continue to wind down the consumer and local commercial banking businesses
• Russia exposure increased by approximately $0.4 billion from last quarter due to net increases in Russia unremittable corporate dividends
• Of the $7.0 billion exposure as of March 31, ~$5.1 billion or 73% was unremittable corporate dividends
• Net investment in the Russian entity of $0.2 billion remained unchanged from prior quarter Ruble largely unchanged sequentially
• Citi has a cumulative translation adjustment (CTA) loss balance of approximately $1.6 billion(1)

• Additionally, if a loss of control of the entity were to occur, then Citi would also recognize a loss of $0.6 billion on intercompany liabilities currently owed by its
