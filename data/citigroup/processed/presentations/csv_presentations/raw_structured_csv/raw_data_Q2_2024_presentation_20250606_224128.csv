Services results, key metrics and statistics
Financial Results Highlights
• Revenues Up 3% YoY, primarily reflecting strength in Securities Services, as
well as the impact of continued underlying momentum in TTS
‒ NII decreased (1)%, largely driven by lower revenue from the net
investment in Argentina, partially offset by the benefit of higher interest
rates
‒ NIR increased 11% on continued strength across underlying fee drivers,
as well as a smaller impact from currency devaluation in Argentina
• Expenses Up 9% YoY, largely driven by an Argentina-related transaction tax
expense, a legal settlement expense and continued investments in product
innovation and technology
• Credit Costs Benefit of $(27) million, largely driven by an ACL release in the
quarter, primarily due to an improved macroeconomic outlook
• Net Income $1.5 billion, up 21% YoY
• RoTCE(3) of 23.8%; Year-to-date RoTCE(3) of 23.9%

Markets results, key metrics and statistics
Financial Results Highlights
• Revenues Up 6% YoY, driven by Equity markets (up 37%), partially offset by a
(3)% decline in Fixed Income markets
‒ The decline in Fixed Income markets was driven by rates and currencies,
down (11)% on lower volatility and tighter spreads, partially offset by
strength in spread products and other fixed income
‒ Equity markets benefited from growth across equity derivatives, which
included a gain related to the Visa B exchange completed in 2Q24.
Equities also benefitted from strong growth in prime balances, up
approximately 18% YoY
• Expenses Down (1)% YoY, driven by productivity savings, partially offset by
higher volume-related expenses
• Credit Costs Benefit of $(11) million, as an ACL release, primarily driven by
changes in portfolio composition combined with an improved macroeconomic
outlook, was partially offset by net credit losses
• Net Income $1.4 billion, up 29% YoY
• RoTCE(3) of 10.7%; Year-to-date RoTCE(3) of 10.6%

U.S. Personal Banking results, key metrics and statistics
Financial Results Highlights
• Revenues Up 6% YoY, driven by NII growth of 5% due to loan growth in
cards, and higher non-interest revenue due to lower partner payments
• Expenses Down (2)% YoY, reflecting lower technology and compensation
costs, partially offset by higher volume-related expenses
• Credit Costs Cost of $2.3 billion, largely driven by NCLs of $1.9 billion as
multiple cards loan vintages that were originated over the last few years are
now maturing, as well as persistent inflation and higher interest rates
impacting a subset of consumers. There was also an ACL build of
approximately $400 million reflecting volume growth in the quarter
• Net Income $121 million
• RoTCE(3) of 1.9%; Year-to-date RoTCE(3) of 3.7%

23,main_text,"• Citi has operated in Argentina for over 100 years and currently serves approximately 1,300 clients, including 700 multinational clients
• The primary activities we engage in with clients in Argentina are liquidity management, payments and custody within Services
• On April 30, 2024, the Central Bank of Argentina (BCRA) issued regulations that allow local entities, including banks, to subscribe to BCRA USD-denominated
bonds, called Bonds for the Reconstruction for a Free Argentina (BOPREAL)
• The bonds, which trade at a discount and come with an upfront transaction tax at the time of the auction, can then be sold in the secondary market, with the
discounted proceeds being used to pay dividends in USD to a parent entity outside of Argentina
• During 2Q24, Citibank Argentina returned approximately $0.2 billion of excess capital through dividends to its parent entity, thereby reducing future FX devaluation

Overview
• Ended nearly all of the institutional banking services offered in Russia as of March 31, 2023
• Remaining services are only those necessary to fulfill our remaining legal and regulatory obligations
• Continue to wind down the consumer and local commercial banking businesses
• Russia exposure increased by approximately $1.2 billion from the previous quarter due to net increases in Russia unremittable corporate dividends and ruble appreciation
• Of the $8.2 billion exposure as of June 30, 2024, ~$6.3 billion or 77% was unremittable corporate dividends
• Net investment in the Russian entity declined by $0.1 billion during 2Q24 to $0.1 billion, largely driven by additional transfer risk reserve in the quarter
• Citi has a cumulative translation adjustment (CTA) loss balance of approximately $1.6 billion(1)
earnings upon either the substantial liquidation or a loss of control of the entity (capital neutral)
• Additionally, if a loss of control of the entity were to occur, then Citi would also recognize a loss of $0.7 billion on intercompany liabilities currently owed by its Russian
