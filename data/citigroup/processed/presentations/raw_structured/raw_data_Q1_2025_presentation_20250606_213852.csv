2) Full year 2025 NII excluding Markets is a forward-looking non-GAAP financial measure. From time to time, management may discuss forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures, such as
forward-looking estimates or targets for revenue, expenses, and RoTCE. We are unable to provide a reconciliation of forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable
GAAP financial measures because we are unable to provide, without unreasonable effort, a meaningful or accurate calculation or estimation of amounts excluded or adjusted that would be necessary
for the reconciliation due to the complexity and inherent difficulty in forecasting and quantifying future amounts or when they may occur. Such unavailable information could be significant to future
results.
