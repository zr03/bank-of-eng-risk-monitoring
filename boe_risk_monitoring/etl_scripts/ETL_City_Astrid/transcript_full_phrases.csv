2022,Q1,Jennifer Landis,"Thank you, operator. And thank you all for joining us. I'd like to remind you that today's presentation, which is available for download on our website, citigroup.com, may contain forward-looking statements which are based on management's current expectations and are subject to uncertainty and changes in circumstances. Actual results may differ materially from these statements due to a variety of factors including those described in our SEC filings. With that, I'll turn it over to Jane.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q1,Jane Fraser,"Thank you, Jenn. And I'd like to start by reiterating my appreciation to those of you who participated in our Investor Day last month. We greatly valued the opportunity to walk you through our refreshed strategy and our plans for the next few years. Given how much time we spent on our strategy that day, today we'll be focusing on the quarter. Nonetheless, as we committed, we will keep you updated on our progress, and you can see the latest report card on slide 2. Today is also the first time we're reporting quarterly results under our new segmentation, which will help you track our efforts. I've got to say it feels like an understatement to say that a lot has happened since Investor Day. So I'm going to talk about the macro environment first, and then after I talk about the quarter, I'll discuss how we're handling Russia and Mark's also going to go through it in more detail. We've been on the front foot since the potential for war first emerged, and we intend to remain so. The Russian invasion of Ukraine and the sanctions it triggered unleashed an enormous supply shock on the world, further fueling inflation and placing global growth under considerable pressure. Back recently from seeing clients in Europe and the Middle East, it is security, yet energy, food, defense, cyber or operational resilience that has risen to the top of their strategic dialog. The macro outlook for the rest of the year can only be described as complex and uncertain. And while my job is to prepare for all outcomes, our view is that strong nominal income growth and continuing momentum in the labor market will help support near-term growth in the US economy in the face of inflationary pressures. But we expect material regional differences in the impact with economic growth in the individual consumer and businesses in Europe hit hardest. With central banks responding to inflation, we're entering a period of higher rates and a flatter US yield curve. Energy and commodities are at the center of the storm globally, but we don't believe we're at the start of a new long supercycle, and we do expect prices to fall to more normal levels. So with that as a backdrop, I think the firm performed reasonably well this quarter. Earlier today we reported net income of $4.3 billion, EPS of $2.02, and an RoTCE of 10.5%. These numbers include impacts related to the divestitures, so the underlying business performance was stronger to the tune of about 150 basis points of RoTCE. Now let's turn to the performance of our five main reporting units. Well, given our emphasis on Services, I'm particularly pleased with our performance in Treasury and Trade Solutions. Fee growth, trade loans, and crossborder transactions – buoyed by higher rates – led to year-over-year revenue growth of 18%. Securities Services also performed well despite the impact of markets with revenues up 6%. In our Markets business, our traders navigated a volatile environment quite well, aided by our mix, with notable performance amongst corporate clients and strong gains in FX and commodities. This led to revenues almost equal to the very active first quarter of 2021. As you might expect, Investment Banking is a different story. While our performance on the advisory side was respectable, I think we can perform a bit better in equity and debt capital markets going forward, even if the wallet remains smaller. Our pipelines are healthy and loan demand is on the rise. Having said that, we don't expect robust activity in the capital markets to resume in the industry until the geopolitical situation and client sentiments improve. In US Personal Banking, we continue to see signs of how healthy and resilient the consumer is through our cost of credit and their payment rates. We see good engagement through key drivers such as card loans and spend volume growth. So, we like where this business is headed. Geopolitics dampened performance in Global Wealth Management this quarter. While revenues improved in the US, our clients in Asia pulled back on new investments and something we saw in our Markets franchise as well. As you know, we are hiring bankers and enhancing our client offerings such as Citi Alliance which we launched last month as a unique platform to support independent advisors. As a result of these efforts, we continued to add clients in both the Private Bank and in Citigold. Turning to capital, we returned $4 billion to our shareholders through stock buybacks and dividends during the first quarter. We now have about 6% fewer common shares outstanding than we did a year ago. At the same time, a sharp increase in interest rates negatively impacted our capital through OCI and largely caused our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio to come in at 11.4% this quarter. I want to be upfront with you about the fact that the macro and geopolitical environment which I spoke about, combined with the impacts of our divestitures, create both headwinds and tailwinds for our capital ratios this year. Now, whilst this will impact the level of our stock buybacks this year, we have a path to our year-end target of 12%, and Mark is going to walk you through these details. And let me be clear, we remain committed to continuing to return excess capital to our shareholders. As you heard at the Investor Day, we're focused on our transformation, and we're making the investments in our infrastructure, risk and controls, and also in our talent and our culture to modernize our bank and to make Citi a winning firm. I recognize that these investments impact our expenses and our returns in the short run. But I firmly believe that success here will not only lead to satisfying our regulatory obligations, but also to improving our competitiveness and our returns in the medium term. So far this year, we've announced new agreements to sell a further seven consumer businesses in Asia and EMEA, the most recent of which were India and Bahrain. We are beginning the sales process in Mexico, and there is significant interest in this iconic franchise. As you've heard me say, this is not an uncomplicated transaction given we will be separating our operations in order to retain our institutional presence. We will take the time necessary to do this the right way and decide which transaction is in the best interest of our shareholders. And we will keep you posted on any developments concerning the three remaining markets, China, Poland, and of course Russia. We started to carefully reduce our operations in and our exposures to Russia in January, and we benefited from being on the front foot here. We've been managing down our financial exposures both in level and composition, and they're at a reasonable level, especially given the additional reserves we took during the quarter. We've also increased reserves for the second and third order impact of the war beyond Russia and Ukraine, and our intention to sell significant portions of our local business in Russia remains. We are in continuous communication with the US government, and we continue to do our part to enforce the sanctions regime. But I've run out of words to describe the tragic consequences of the war in Ukraine. I remain incredibly proud of how our people have risen to the occasion from every corner of our firm. Our people in Ukraine have kept our bank operating in the country where they can help NGOs deliver aid on the ground and help society function as best as possible. And many of our colleagues have opened their homes to refugees, and we will continue to help in any way we can. So with all that is going on in the world, we remain laser-focused on the execution of our strategy and our transformation. I expect macro environment to remain unpredictable, to say the least, in the backdrop of a war which is equally tragic and unnecessary, and a persistent pandemic. And I can speak to the last one personally. Having just recovered from a brief encounter with COVID, much as I would like to, I can't blame Paco for it. Now, I'd like to turn it over to Mark, and then we will be delighted to take your questions.","capital ratio, , billion, revenue, net income",yes,Yes,"common equity tier 1, capital ratio, tier 1 capital",No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q1,Mark Mason,"Thank you, Jane, and good morning, everyone. I'm going to start with the firmwide financial results focusing on year-over-year comparisons for the first quarter, unless I indicate otherwise, then spend a little more time on expenses and Russia, and end with the results of each segment. On slide 4, we show financial results for the full firm. As Jane mentioned earlier, in the first quarter, we reported net income of $4.3 billion and an EPS of $2.02 with an RoTCE of 10.5% on $19.2 billion of revenues. Embedded in these results are Asia Consumer divestiture-related impacts that are detailed in the appendix of the presentation. In the quarter, total revenues decreased 2% as strength in net interest income driven by Services and PBWM was more than offset by lower non-interest revenue across businesses. That said, we continue to see strong performance in the key business drivers we shared on Investor Day, which I will walk you through in detail shortly. Total expenses of $13.2 billion increased 15%, or 10% excluding the Asia divestiture-related impacts I just mentioned. Cost of credit was $755 million, as net credit losses of $872 million were partially offset by a net ACL release. Embedded in the net ACL release is a Russia-related build of approximately $1.9 billion. This includes $1 billion related to exposure to Russia and about $900 million to account for the broader impact on the macro environment. This was more than offset by a release related to a COVID-19 uncertainty reserve, primarily in US Personal Banking, given the continued resilience of the underlying portfolio, specifically in the US. As of today, we have about $17.9 billion in total reserves with a reserve-to-funded loan ratio of 2.35%. On slide 5, we show an expense walk for the first quarter with the key underlying drivers. As I mentioned earlier, we incurred some divestiture-related costs this quarter. These costs largely related to a goodwill write-down that we incurred in Legacy Franchises, as part of our re-segmentation and divestitures. It is important to note the goodwill impact is capital neutral. Excluding the divestiture-related costs, expenses increased by approximately 10%. 3% of the increase was driven by transformation investments, with about two-thirds related to the risk, controls, data, and finance programs, and approximately 30% of that is related to technology investments. About 2% of the increase was driven by business-led investments, as we continue to hire commercial and investment bankers as well as client advisors. In addition, we are investing in technology across Services, Wealth and Cards. 1% was due to higher revenue and volume-related expenses largely in Markets and Cards, and approximately 4% was driven by inflation and other risk and control investments, partially offset by productivity savings. Across all of these buckets we continue to invest in technology, which is up 12% for the quarter. On slide 6 we provide an update on our exposure to Russia. As Jane mentioned, as of the end of the quarter, our remaining exposure to Russia stood at about $7.8 billion, down from $9.8 billion at year end. And importantly, the mix of the remaining exposure has changed and shifted in a positive way. We have reduced our direct Russia country risk exposure from $5.4 billion to about $3.7 billion which consists of loans, AFS, derivatives, and offbalance sheet exposure. The remaining exposure, which previously totaled $4.4 billion now totals $4.1 billion and consists of deposits and cash with the central bank, reverse repos, and cross-border exposure. Additionally, our net investment in our Russian entity is now approximately $700 million, down from about $1 billion at year end. And the currency translation adjustment, or CTA, related to our net investment stands at $1 billion. And as I mentioned previously, we took credit reserves of about $1.9 billion with about $1 billion for direct exposures to Russia and another approximately $900 million for broader impacts given the macro environment. So we feel we have reserved prudently at this point. In the normal course of our planning and risk management, we run a range of stress scenarios, and we've taken this same approach with our exposure to Russia. And as a result of the actions that we've taken to reduce our risk, we now believe that under a range of severe stress scenarios, our potential risk of loss is now estimated at approximately $2.5 billion to $3 billion, down meaningfully from what I described at our Investor Day. On slide 7, we show net interest income, loans, and deposits. In the first quarter, net interest income increased by approximately $50 million on a sequential basis as interest income from loans as well as higher deposit spreads were partially offset by day count. Excluding day count, net interest income increased by approximately $290 million. Sequentially, net interest margin increased by 7 basis points as lower average deposits in Services and higher interest income from loans were partially offset by balance sheet growth in Markets. On a year-over-year basis, net interest income increased by approximately $370 million driven by Cards, deposits volumes, and spreads as well as income from the investment portfolio, partially offset by lower net interest income in Markets, and we grew average loans by approximately 3% in both ICG and PBWM. On slide 8, we show our summary balance sheet and key capital and liquidity metrics. We maintained a very strong balance sheet. Of our $2.4 trillion balance sheet, about 23% or $551 billion, are high-quality liquid assets, or HQLA, and we maintained total liquidity resources of approximately $960 billion. From a capital perspective, we ended the quarter with a CET1 capital ratio of approximately 11.4% under both standardized and advanced approaches, with standardized remaining the binding ratio down from 12.2% at year end. During the quarter, we adopted SA-CCR and absorbed a significant impact from the sharp move in interest rates. We will go into more detail shortly on the drivers of capital in the quarter. However, it is important to note that despite these impacts we continued to expect to manage to a CET1 ratio of 12% by the end of the year due to the expected GSIB surcharge increase to 3.5% at the beginning of 2023. We expect the combination of net income generation, DTA utilization, and capital generated by the closing of several of the consumer exits in Asia to be sufficient to reach the 12% CET1 ratio by the end of the year. As we said at Investor Day, we're committed to returning excess capital to our shareholders, and as we see a pull to par in the investment portfolio, reversing that $4 billion interest rate-driven impact, we would expect to be able to deploy that capital over time. And as you know, under the SCB framework and given the uncertain macro environment, we assess on a quarter-by-quarter basis the right level of buybacks and we will continue to do so throughout the year. For the second quarter, we expect only a modest amount of buybacks and we'll evaluate that level throughout the quarter taking into account market conditions. Given the sizeable impact of some of the drivers I wanted to spend a minute to walk through the puts and takes this quarter and how we ended the quarter with a CET1 ratio of about 11.4%. First, we generated net income which added 35 basis points. Second, over $4 billion of dividends and buybacks drove a reduction of about 36 basis points. Third, the interest rate impact on AOCI through our investment portfolio drove a 35 basis point reduction. Fourth, the increase in disallowed DTA largely driven by the reduction in CET1 due to the interest rate impact I just mentioned, drove another 15-basis-point reduction. Finally, the remainder was driven by a combination of other factors including a reduction in RWA. With all of that said, as I just mentioned, we have a path to a 12% CET1 capital ratio by year end and remain committed to returning excess capital to shareholders. On slide 10 we show the results for our Institutional Clients Group. Revenues decreased 2% largely driven by Investment Banking, partially offset by an increase in Services revenue. And Markets declined slightly against a strong quarter last year. Expenses increased 13% driven by transformation investments, business-led investments, and volume-related expenses partially offset by productivity savings. Cost of credit was nearly $1 billion, largely driven by a $1.5 billion build related to our exposures in Russia as well as the broader impact on the macro environment. And outside of Russia, we continued to see strong credit performance across our portfolio as clients' balance sheets remain healthy. This resulted in net income of $2.6 billion, down approximately 51%, largely driven by the higher expenses and an ACL build versus a release in the prior year. We grew average loans by 3% largely driven by trade finance. Average deposits grew 2% as we continued to see good momentum and deepening of existing client relationships and new client acquisitions. And ICG delivered an RoTCE of 11.2%. On slide 11, we show revenue performance by business and the key drivers we laid out at Investor Day, which we will continue to show you each quarter. In Services we continued to see a very strong new client pipeline and a deepening with our existing clients, and we expect that momentum to continue. In Treasury and Trade Solutions, revenues were up 18% driven by growth in net interest income as well as strong fee growth with both commercial and large corporate clients. And we continue to see strong underlying drivers in TTS that indicate continued strong client activity with US dollar clearing volumes up 2%, cross-border flows up 17%, and commercial card volumes up 54%. Again, these metrics are indicators of client activity and fees and on a combined basis drive approximately 50% of total TTS fee revenue. Securities Services revenues grew 6% as net interest income grew 17% driven by higher interest rates across currencies, and fee revenues grew 2% due to higher assets under custody. Overall Markets revenues were down 2% versus a strong quarter last year. In the quarter activity levels benefited from client repositioning and strong risk management in light of Fed actions and overall geopolitical uncertainty. Fixed Income Markets revenues were down 1%. We saw strong client engagement particularly with our corporate clients in FX and commodities, with our rates business also benefiting from higher volatility. Spread products were negatively impacted by less client activity. Equity Markets revenues were down 4% compared to a very strong prior-year period. In the quarter we saw strong equity derivatives performance and grew prime finance balances. Banking revenues, excluding gains or losses on loan hedges, were down 32% as heightened geopolitical uncertainty and the overall macro backdrop impacted activity in debt and equity capital markets. Investment Banking revenues were down 43% driven by the contraction in capital markets activity, partially offset by growth in M&A. Corporate Lending revenues were down 6% largely driven by lower average loans. Now turning to slide 12, we show the results for our Personal Banking and Wealth Management business. Revenues declined 1% as net interest income was more than offset by lower non-interest revenue. Expenses were up 14%, driven by transformation investments, business-led investments, and higher volume-driven expenses, partially offset by productivity savings. Cost of credit was a $376 million benefit, as an ACL release more than offset net credit losses. We had a net release of over $1 billion of ACL related to COVID-19 uncertainty reserves. I would note that even after this release, we maintain over $9.8 billion in credit reserves against our US cards portfolios, or approximately 7.6% of total loans. This resulted in a net income decline of 23% and an RoTCE of just over 23%. Adjusting for the ACL release, RoTCE would have been approximately 13%. On slide 13, we show PBWM revenues by product as well as key business drivers and metrics. Branded Cards revenues declined 1% on higher average payment rates and higher acquisition and rewards costs as we continued to see attractive investment opportunities and strong customer engagement. We are seeing encouraging underlying drivers with new accounts up 24%, card spend volumes also up 24%, and average loans up 7%. Retail Services revenues were flat as higher net interest income was offset by higher partner payments, driven by improved credit performance, and we are seeing positive underlying drivers with spend up 14% and average loans up 1%. While payment rates remain elevated, we believe we have finally begun to see some normalization. As a result, interest-earning balances in Branded Cards were relatively flat on a sequential basis while Retail Services grew interest-earning balances by 3% sequentially despite seasonally lower card spending volumes. Retail Banking revenues declined 6%, largely driven by lower mortgage originations. Wealth revenues declined 1% driven by less client activity in investments, partially offset by higher deposits. Investment revenues declined as geopolitical tension impacted the capital markets which resulted in clients pulling back their trading activity particularly in Asia. However, underlying drivers remained strong with average deposits up 14%, average loans up 5%, client assets up 4%, and client advisors up 6%. On slide 14, we show results for the Legacy Franchises. Revenues declined 14% driven by lower revenue across the exit markets, largely driven by the Korea wind down as well as the muted investment activity in Asia. Expenses were up 31% largely driven by the goodwill impairment I mentioned earlier but, again, this is neutral to capital. Cost of credit was $160 million in the quarter, driven by net credit losses, and as a result, net income declined significantly. On slide 15, we show results for Corporate / Other. Revenues increased significantly, largely driven by higher net revenue from the investment portfolio. Expenses were down, largely on lower compensation expenses. And to briefly touch on the full year 2022 outlook, at this point, we still expect to see low-single digit revenue growth and mid-single digit expense growth both excluding divestiture-related impacts this year. And with that, Jane and I would be happy to take your questions.","capital ratio, billion, , revenue, net income, liquidity, million, trillion, net interest income, cet1",yes,Yes,"cet1, capital ratio",No,,No,,No,,Yes,gsib,No,,No,,Yes,"cet1 ratio, net interest margin"
2022,Q1,"Question And Answer
Operator",Thank you. Our first question is from Glenn Schorr with Evercore. Your line is open.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q1,Glenn Schorr,"Hi there. How are you? Okay. So when I first looked at the reserve release, even including the $1.9 billion Russian reserve, we were like, wait, what economic scenario are they writing to, because everybody else added provisions. But now that you've given us some of the color, I start to understand it. So, it feels to me – and correct me if I'm wrong – you just were slower to release the COVID reserves and it sounds like you still have a lot in the coffers with that 7.6% that you mentioned. So, I just want to see if you can give a little more color between what you took reserves for, what you released reserves for, and if you tweaked your economic scenarios at all to get to the current reserve, if that's not too much to ask.",billion,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q1,Jane Fraser,"Hey, there, Glenn. Why don't I kick off and I'll pass it to Mark. So, you are absolutely right, we had taken a rather conservative approach to releasing our COVID-related reserves in the US Personal Banking business last year compared to some. We were comfortable that this quarter that was the appropriate thing to do given the state of COVID and the US economy. And as you can see from the numbers, with a 2.35% ACL coverage ratio and with the ratio that we have in Cards, 7.6% in particular, I'm very comfortable that we have a prudent and appropriate reserve level. But let me hand it over to Mark for the down and the dirty.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q1,Mark Mason,"Yeah. Good morning, Glenn. I think you've captured it right in the sense we obviously did a meaningful build related to Russia. The majority of the release was in fact tied to the COVID-19 management adjustment that Jane referenced. As we thought about these scenarios, as you know we run a base scenario, we did tweak that a bit in bringing the GDP assumptions down from what they would have been in the fourth quarter, and that obviously also impacted kind of the outer years in our assumption. And the other piece is, when we look the downside scenario – so our analysis for CECL is a combination of a base scenario and a downside scenario. Under the downside scenario, we did increase the severity of the downside to account for, again, a bit of the current environment that we're all managing through. So, those puts and takes kind of netted out to what you see that we've reported, which is a net release, but largely driven by those two drivers.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q1,Jane Fraser,"And I'd just add in, as Mark talked about in his prepared remarks, we took an additional reserve of $900 million for the second and third order impacts of the war and the impacts on supply chains and other pieces that as we look forward we were concerned about for the global economy, it's a huge source of uncertainty as to what that will be.",million,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q1,Mark Mason,"Yeah. That's part of the $1.9 billion, obviously. I would point out that when you look through at the underlying performance of the portfolio, they're still holding up quite nicely. When you look at the performance of our consumer customers, whether you're looking at the NCL rate and where that's trending, or you look at the 90-day delinquency and where that's trending, still very strong. Even when you look on the corporate side, if you adjust for the Russia-related build and those drove a bit of the NAL increase, but still very strong performance there, too.",billion,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q1,Operator,Your next question comes from Erika Najarian with UBS. Your line is open.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q1,Erika Najarian,"Hi. Good morning. I just wanted to ask you a question, Jane and Mark, on CET1, and wanted to make sure we get – your investors get the message correctly. So from the 11.4%, you said that net income capital release from divestitures and DTA utilization are going to be the drivers to build to 12% CET1 by year end 2021. Obviously, AOCI is a wild card, unpredictable, but perhaps give us a sense of should we then think about the buyback as just a fallout in terms of that equation, right, is the first question. Number two, what is the desire to increase the dividend even nominally in this stress test year? And third, how does the DTA impact that was negative in the first quarter turn to a positive impact? And Mark, nice job on the RWA. I think that everybody was scared that that was going to be a big negative number this quarter.","net income, cet1",no,Yes,cet1,No,,No,,Yes,stress test,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q1,Mark Mason,"Thank you. You got a lot there, Erika, that we've got to unpack, so I'll try to capture it all and you'll point to whatever I may miss. But let's start with the beginning of your question, just kind of the 12% and how we build back up to the 12%. So, we ended the quarter at an estimated 11.4%. To get to the 12%, that'd be somewhere between $7 billion and $8 billion of capital that would be required. Jane mentioned, I mentioned there are a number of puts and takes that play through that. You pointed out a few of them. So, you will have estimates for our net income between the second and fourth quarter, so you can forecast what that would be. There is probably another $1.6 billion or so of a benefit from the DTA. So, what I mean by that? There's the $800 million that I've referenced in the past of utilization of the DTA, and the balance would be the elimination of the amount that we tripped above the threshold this quarter. So, there are two components that carry forwards that impact, the DTA and then there is the timing difference which is equated to about 10% of our capital. So, this quarter we actually tripped that timing difference portion of the disallowed DTA, in part because of how the OCI reduction played through. So as that bleeds back in, over time, we would expect to have capital build up which increases that threshold and, therefore, be able to back off the increase that we saw in the quarter related to the DTA. The third component would be the capital from exits. So, you didn't mention that one. As you know, there are a number of exits that we're looking to close by the end of the year. They'll contribute about $4 billion of capital to that equation. And then there is the bleeding back in of the OCI impact, which will, give or take, give us another $1 billion. So, those are the pluses. Those are the things that kind of play in on the capital-generation side. And then on the offsets, you've got preferred dividends, you got common dividends, whatever growth we play out or put to work from an RWA point of view, and that leaves the balance for share repurchases. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we would expect in the second quarter a modest level of buybacks in light of all of those puts and takes. The good news is that the headwinds that we've talked about, all things being equal, so assuming no further rate changes, many of those headwinds bleed back in over time, allowing for us to do what we've committed to, which is returning capital to shareholders over time. In terms of dividends, we always look at that as part of the CCAR submission and part of our broader capital planning, but we'll see how the results come out from CCAR. But I would lean in on a point we've had to make a number of times now, which is given where we're trading, it makes a lot of sense to be doing buybacks, and so we'll likely continue to lean that way as opposed to doing a lot to change the dividend. But stay tuned as the capital planning continues to evolve.","billion, net income, million",yes,No,,No,,No,,Yes,ccar,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q1,Operator,And your next question comes from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q1,Mike Mayo,"Hi. Could you talk some about Treasury and Trade Solutions both at the first quarter level – I guess, Securities Services did better, what you're seeing just combination of rates and more corporate demand and the complexity around the global situation. And then just more generally, the joint calling efforts you guys are doing with lending and payments, so from the specific to the general.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q1,Jane Fraser,"Well, maybe I kick off with a couple of pieces and then hand it over to Mark. I think what we've seen, frankly, Mike, across the board, this quarter has been the value of our global network that we talked about, be it in Markets we had a lot of strong corporate activities and FX, that we saw tremendous activity for TTS, growing with our commercial banking clients, and we saw a lot of linkages across, and obviously it was a strong quarter for us in trade because, again, with the global network the ability to provide clients with end-to-end solutions in this interesting world that we're living in is something they really rely upon us. So you saw trade loans up 16%, you saw really many of the drivers that we laid out for you in Investor Day performing particularly strongly. But, Mark, why don't I pass to you?",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q1,Mark Mason,"Yeah. I'd make a couple comments. So, one, I'd point out that, again, we had a strong quarter in TTS. The revenues were up 18% versus the prior quarter up – that was year-over-year – versus the prior quarter up 8%, and, yes, some of that was due to rates playing through, so net interest income was up 18%. But look at the noninterest revenue, that was up 19%. So to your point, Jane, we're seeing good fee revenue growth play through as well. Securities Services had a good quarter as well, it was up 6% revenue year-over-year and part of that was through fee revenue growth as well. So as you said good, strong engagement with clients and helping them think through some of the uncertainty that's out here, particularly as it relates to supply chains, helping them work through with their partners through the trade lending growth that we're seeing and making good headway with the commercial client offering as well. So I would say a very good quarter – very strong quarter for TTS, and we expect that momentum to continue.","revenue, net interest income",yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q1,Jane Fraser,"And, to your question about sort of joint calling effort, we're quite for it – making sure that we're forensically managing the synergies that we talked about cross-calling efforts, and I think Paco and I are both pleased with how those are going, and this quarter was an example of that.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q1,Operator,And your next question comes from Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. MATT O’,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q1,Connor,"Hi. I was hoping to follow up on the Russian slide here – a bit on the Russian slide 6. I guess, first question, why don't you take just a bigger kind of stab at reserving for maybe the severe stress scenario? I'm not really an expert on what's going on, but from what I read it – it feels kind of pretty severe and it seems like, broadly speaking, kind of other corporations, not as many banks, but just corporations are taking kind of more material losses versus $1 billion on $10 billion. And then just a related question, if you could elaborate on what the broader impacts is. I guess I'm a little surprised that the reserve for that was as big as the direct Russian reserve or roughly the same.",billion,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q1,Mark Mason,"Sure. Why don't I take that? So the first thing I'd say is that we're not a $10 billion, right? So we ended the year last year, 2021, at $9.8 billion. We ended the quarter at $7.8 billion of exposure, so we brought the exposure down by $2 billion inside of the last three months. I'd also point out that a number of things were important components of that. So if you look at slide 6, you'll see that the loans – and these are both ICG and consumer loans, largely ICG, largely corporate loans – have come down by $600 million, and that's really been a reduction in our risk exposure, right? So borrowers paying down, us limiting the extension of new credit, et cetera. The AFS securities have come down $600 million, and that is really a reduction mostly driven by sales. So we've gotten out of those securities. Yes, there are some market-to-market losses, but they're not material. That flows through OCI, not material. You can see that the off-balance sheet unfunded commitments have trended down as well. Deposits and cash equivalents have gone up because we've actually seen the repayment of those loans come back, and we've been – we've had to put that cash with the central bank just given some of the restrictions that are there. We've been actively working down the reverse repo assets which are really secured with sovereign bond exposure, and we've been bringing down the third-party cross-border exposure. So a lot of hard work has gone into bringing that exposure down to $7.8 billion, and if you think about the $1 billion that I referenced, it's kind of net of $6.8 billion, right? So the second part of your question was how do we think about reserves and what are those different components. Well, we look at the reserves in terms of the actual name-specific loan exposure we have, how we're rating those entities in this environment, and then we actually run that through our models and we come up with an appropriate reserve tied to that rating. So that $1 billion is related to the direct exposure that we have to these Russian clients and entities. The broader impact takes into consideration the spillover effect that might impact other names or other industries outside of Russia due to things like commodity pricing and what have you. And then there's a third component that is tied to the global uncertainty that gets created from a dynamic like this. So we built the reserves considering those multiple components. The last point I'd make is that when you look at some of the names, there are a significant number of names that are large multinational names that have this exposure in the country, and they provide parental support for some of the exposure that's here as well. So we really try to take a detailed comprehensive look at this and build the reserves in a way that we think are prudent recognizing that there are other scenarios that could play out that we want to be prepared for and have a view on as well.","billion, million",yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q1,Operator,And our next question – thank you. Our next question comes from Gerard Cassidy with RBC Capital Markets.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q1,Gerard Cassidy,"Mark, you did a good job in describing the CET1 ratio walk for us. What's new that none of us have experienced yet on an ongoing basis is the SA-CCR, the 49 basis points that reduced your CET1 ratio. Can you share with us how does that work on an ongoing basis? Is that a number that's going to stay constant, or does that change every quarter based upon increase or lower risk in this area?",cet1,no,Yes,cet1,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,Yes,cet1 ratio
2022,Q1,Mark Mason,"Yeah. It's an increase in our risk-weighted assets that's really tied largely to the derivative exposures that we have. What I'd say is obviously how one manages their exposures and balance sheet and engagement with clients will impact that. But importantly, it's a market dynamic that needs to play out as well. So as more RWA and capital is required for these types of positions, there has to – it's going to impact returns and ultimately will impact pricing as the market starts to incorporate this now higher requirement. And so it will continue to evolve. The thing I'd point you to is that as we think about managing our businesses and in particular Markets, you would have heard us mention at Investor Day that we're looking – continually looking for opportunities to optimize the balance sheet – optimize RWA, right? And so we talked about targeting our revenue to RWA for our Markets business and we're actively working at that now. And that's going to be important as we continue to manage not only the balance sheet requirements that we have but our intent to try and return more capital to shareholders and improve our returns.","revenue, risk-weighted assets",yes,Yes,risk-weighted assets,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q1,Operator,Your next question comes from Ebrahim Poonawala with Bank of America.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q1,Ebrahim Poonawala,"Good morning, Jane, Mark. Just sticking with capital, a two-part question. One, if rates continue to move higher, Mark, is there anything you can do to hedge the AOCI? And secondly, if you can walk us through around Banamex if you do strike a deal at some point this year, what are the implication on capital at deal announcement versus deal close, would appreciate that?",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q1,Mark Mason,"Sure. So, look, I mean there – what we've built in – what we've got built into the forecast and the walk back to 12% is the forward curve as of the end of the quarter, so that's what we've built in. As we think about that, that was a pretty sudden move through the quarter, 160 basis points on the two-year in the quarter. That's now in the expectation. We have built in an assumption around more rate moves that could happen just as a bit of cushion as I think about the outlook and as I think about the walk. We do have hedges in place as it relates to some of the positions that we have and as it relates to OCI, and we'll continue to manage that to ensure we reduce the risk from rate increases, which, by the way, we've been actively doing over the past couple years. If you look at kind of how the balance sheet has evolved, we've been moving from out of AFS and into held to maturity over the past couple years, reducing that risk of a negative impact to OCI. And if you look at the DV01, we've cut that down from as high as $60 million to about $30 million or so. So we've been actively managing with an eye towards how do we reduce that sensitivity, if you will. Why don't I let Jane kind of touch on the Mexico piece?",million,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q1,Jane Fraser,"Yeah. So as I said, it's quite a complex separation and transaction as we're going to be separating our market leading and sizeable ICG franchise in Mexico from the consumer and the small business – business that we'll be selling. It will take a bit of time as we work through this. It's a fantastic franchise, and as we are starting some very preliminary conversations with the buyers, it's attracting a lot of attention, because it is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity here and we have a range of options I'm sure ahead from IPO sale, et cetera. But this is going to take time. We want to do it properly. And by time, I mean a few quarters. So, I think, we're not anticipating at this very early stage whether that would be this year or early next year. But, Mark, why don't I pass to you in terms of how we look at the CTA impact of that one.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q1,Mark Mason,"Yeah. So, look, I mean, as you said, Jane, the – what's going to be important is that we make the right decision for the people, for the business and equally important for our shareholders, and we're going to absolutely make sure we do that. In terms of the way this plays out, as I think you're aware, and I've mentioned before that we've got roughly a $2.8 billion, $2.9 billion currency translation adjustment related to our consumer Mexico franchise. And so when we sign the deal, we will have that flow through the P&L. It ultimately gets offset at closing, and so, again, you'd have another timing difference between the accounting impact and the ultimate economic impact, but that's kind of the component that would play through at signing, whenever that were to occur.",billion,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,

2022,Q1,Betsy Graseck,"Hi. Good morning. Couple of questions. One, a little bit ticky-tacky, but on your NIM sensitivity that you gave in your 10-Q – 10-K, it would be helpful to understand how much of that NIM sensitivity is coming from the non-Legacy businesses, how much that have NIM sensitivity is going to be retained after you sell out the businesses that you've identified?",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q1,Mark Mason,"Yeah. I don't have that breakout, Betsy. I mean, I – we'll have to kind of get back to you on that. I don't have that breakout.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q1,Operator,And your next question comes from Vivek Juneja with JPMorgan. Your line is open.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q1,Vivek Juneja,"Hi, Mark, Jane. A quick question, probably more for Mark. The RWA increase from the higher volatility that you'd have seen in your trading assets in the first quarter, what was the offset to that?",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q1,Mark Mason,"So, look, in the first quarter, the major driver that we've seen is really on the credit risk side from an RWA point of view, and that was really tied to SA-CCR. That's the biggest driver of the fourth quarter, the first quarter RWA increase that we've seen. So the RWA from a market risk point of view was mostly flat due to reductions in trading book securitizations that was kind of – those are kind of the main drivers there.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q1,Jane Fraser,"And what I'd say is, and you certainly heard this loud and clear from Paco at Investor Day, a lot of the strategy here is also making sure that we're optimizing our capital. We're very mindful around the returns that we're generating and how we allocate and deploy capital, and this was a quarter that Andy and Paco in running the businesses are being very mindful around that, so that also helped.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q1,Mark Mason,"Yeah. So like I said, securitizations would be an offset as would some of the equities derivatives.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q1,Operator,Our next question is from Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research. Your line is open.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q1,Steven Chubak,"Hi. Good morning. So, it was encouraging certainly to hear you guys reaffirm the 2022 guidance for a low-single digit revenue growth, mid-single digit expense growth. But just given the positive surprise on revenues in the quarter, the number of rate hikes getting baked into the forward curve has increased since your last update. Want to get some perspective on just why you didn't revise the revenue forecast higher. And just given the pace and timing of investments, as we look ahead to 2023 and beyond, how should we think about the timing for when you guys can get back to positive operating leverage?",revenue,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q1,Mark Mason,"Yeah. Look, let me kind of take that. So on the revenue side, as you would have heard us describe, there have been puts and takes that have played through the quarter and there is still a fair amount of uncertainty that's out there. And so while there have been increases as it relates to rates, and we've seen and expect to see some benefit play through for that, there has also been an impact on banking revenues as we see the uncertainty creating a dynamic where corporate clients are pausing particularly as it relates to equity capital markets and debt capital markets. And so as I mentioned, there are offsets that play out, and so we felt comfortable kind of maintaining the guidance on the revenue top line. In terms of the expenses, as I mentioned at Investor Day, the spend that we have going on in expenses is critically important, and we're still growing them as it relates to transformation and as it relates to business led investments. On the business-led investment side, the good news is that we're starting to see some of the top line strength play out, not just driven by rates, but also driven by things like fees, which is what we've forecasted. On the transformation side, we continue to make progress, and we've talked about how critically important that is to our operations going forward. We expect that that will peak or arc, if you will, as we talked about at Investor Day, and that will occur in the near term and will be an important offset, if you will, to the structural expense base that we have as the efficiencies from that spending plays through.",revenue,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q1,Jane Fraser,"And just to chip in as well, we're committed to the arc of the investments on our transformation and on our growth. We think they're both critically important. We're equally committed to managing our expense base prudently and forensically. And I think the piece – if there is any comfort from our numbers, is we're getting on with it. We're not hanging around here. You've seen us do that with the divestitures. We're doing the same on our transformation and on our investment side, getting very focused on making sure we deliver the results you'd expect from them. You'll see something similar when we start divesting and closing the different transactions, and we'll talk to you about what we're doing on getting those any stranded expenses out and getting focused on that. So, you can expect us – to see us going pretty aggressively after different elements of our cost base as the timing is appropriate.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q1,Operator,"And your next question comes from Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Your line is open. Ken, please check your mute button. All right. If I may move along to the next. Next question is from Jim Mitchell with Seaport Global. Please go ahead.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q1,Jim Mitchell,"Hey. Good morning, Mark and Jane. Maybe just a question on – just following up on the last question. Do you have a specific update for NII growth this year given the forward curve is substantially higher than 100 basis points and how you're thinking about NII overall? And then as a subset of that, how do we think about your deposit base, your more institutional deposit base acting in aggressive QT environment? Thanks.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q1,Mark Mason,"Yeah, sure. Look, I'm not giving kind of guidance kind of broken out, if you will, for the revenues. We're standing by the full year guidance that we've talked about. Obviously, with rates moving the way that they have, we would expect that we would see some improvement on the NII line, but I haven't given specific guidance broken out for the two lines. In terms of the deposit base we have, as you know, we've got a mix of consumer and corporate client deposits. We skew a bit more heavily towards the corporate client deposit base. That generally comes with a higher beta, and so they're likely to be more reactive to and reactive sooner to the increase in interest rates, and quantitative tightening will certainly have a longer-term impact on the level of deposits that's out there. But with that said, our plans, both in the near term and as we've played out the Investor Day forecast, don't hinge upon significant growth in deposits. We'd expect some growth, but growth consistent with kind of pre pandemic levels, but that's not outsized growth, and we believe our strategy, which is broader than just going after deposits, but really is around solutions for corporate clients and the full spectrum of financial services for the consumers that we focus on will allow for us to capture an appropriate level consistent with how the economy evolves.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,

2022,Q1,Erika Najarian,"Hi. Actually, Chubak and Jim asked my question. I think it might be helpful to consider, Mark, for next quarter to break out the NII guide given obviously the uncertainty that we all have on forecasting trading and investment banking.

2022,Q1,Operator,Your next question comes from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q1,Betsy Graseck,"Hi. I just wanted to ask about how you're thinking about the US card business. This is an area where it feels like in some areas you've been lagging a bit, and in other areas accelerating. And I just wanted to get a sense as to how you're thinking about the trajectory this year in particular since it's one of the better margin businesses that you've got and it also, obviously, keys into the reserve ratio a bit. Thanks.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q1,Jane Fraser,"Yeah. I'm surprised you thought we were lagging, because we certainly don't see that. I've been really pleased with how the cards franchise has been performing on multiple different drivers, on client acquisition, on the spend, on some of the new propositions that we've been bringing in. You heard from Anand about the growth on proprietary cards, the installment lending growth, 75% up, albeit from a small base this quarter. So there are multiple different dimensions. So I think it's – we're very pleased to see the business actually picking up. And as I said, Betsy, in my prepared remarks, I like where the business is headed. I think part of it is I am more positive around the US economy and the US consumer than really any other geographies around the world, and that helps with so much momentum in the labor market. We're seeing still quite a bit of excess liquidity sitting there in the back pocket of our consumers and very healthy balance sheets. I think we have peaked in the payment rates, so we're just starting to see the first signs of that coming down, and I think that's good because it's a return to a more – it should be the return this year to more healthy behavior. The spend has obviously been quite remarkable. It's up in the mid-20%. Also great to see the experience side and that services side coming back in again, and that we've been seeing it in travel, we've been seeing it in apparel. People like getting dressed up to go to dinner again in a restaurant. Those different things, it's nice to see things coming back to normality. So, I'm pretty positive both from cyclically where this is headed, the recovery from COVID where it's headed, and I'm also pretty happy with the strategy that Anand laid out and the progress we're making against it. So I think some good things ahead here.",liquidity,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q1,Mark Mason,"Yeah. And the only thing I'd add is a couple of numbers, right? So the sales were up 24% year-over-year, exceeding pre-pandemic levels across the categories. Acquisitions were up 23% year-over year, again bringing on new card customers into our family, if you will. Revenues were down 2%, but you really have to look through the investments that we're making in acquisitions and the rewards costs associated with those, that impact that revenue being down 2%. If you adjust for the acquisition costs, actually our revenues would be up 1% year-over-year, So I agree completely with you, Jane, which is we're very pleased with the progress here. We're seeing similar momentum start to play through on the Retail Services side as well. The sequential performance on average interest-earning balances is a good signal for how things will play out, and we continue to feel good about the growth we forecasted towards the back half of the year.",revenue,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q1,Operator,And our next question comes from Andrew Lim with Société Générale. Your line is open.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q1,Andrew Lim,"Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. So I get the impression that maybe people are surprised by your NII guidance because in the past you've officially given it as based on a run-off balance sheet whereas it appears based on a static balance sheet. And I think you mentioned a few quarters ago that if it was on the same basis, a static balance sheet, that your NII uplift would be about $2.5 billion to $3 billion for a 100-basis point parallel shift.",billion,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q1,Mark Mason,Yeah.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q1,Andrew Lim,"Is that something you're still sticking to? And then within the shape of that, how much of that is due to the short-term increasing by 100 basis points? I think you're much more sensitive to the short term going up. Is that something that you can disclose a rough figure on?",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q1,Mark Mason,"Yeah. Sure, and good morning. Yeah, I'd like to separate kind of NII guidance from the IRE sensitivity and disclosure that we have. And so you're absolutely right and I'm not moving – we're not moving off of our IRE disclosure at all. The analysis is such that with a parallel shift in rates of about 100 basis points that we see somewhere around $2.5 billion to $3 billion of an increase kind of play through. And as you know or as I've said before, that's across currencies with about two-thirds of that being to non US currencies and the other third, obviously, being US. So that is still our view from an IRE point of view. We're not – we haven't changed that view.",billion,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q1,Operator,And our next question comes from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q1,Mike Mayo,"Hi, follow-up. I guess this is not new, but the expenses are just so high, and we haven't heard the 4% inflation number from others, and maybe others were able to offset that a little bit more. And the 1% due to volume related, when Jane you mentioned, you don't expect this level's capital markets to be sustained. So I guess I'm just – I'm griping about something that's been around for a while. I get it, you have the reg order, you have the transformation, you have business sales. You've said you underinvested in the past and everything else. But, I mean, you have 1,200 basis points between your expense and revenue growth. And it just seems so high. But you're also guiding for what I think is, like, 300 basis points of that spread for the full year. So does that mean this is as bad as it gets and that spread should be narrowed? And just some of those other – inflation, volumes, expenses – expenses generally, because it's frustrating for investors.",revenue,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q1,Mark Mason,"Yeah. So, Mike, why don't I take that and kind of try and talk through it. So the first thing I'd say is that the 10% growth that we have in the quarter is consistent with the guidance. I just want to be clear that in Investor Day that's what we talked about. We would love for the number to be different, but we understand and we know that this is what's required to get the franchise to where it needs to be. And so we're taking those hard decisions, we're spending the money where we need to spend it, we're being diligent about that to make sure that we're not being wasteful in that effort, but we don't want to create or go through the things that we've gone through in the past in the way of underinvesting, and so we're going to avoid that. The second thing is – and you acknowledged that kind of in your reference to transformation and business led investments. On the structural investments spend I should say, about half of that is from inflation, so not the full 4%. A portion of it is also from non-consent order, risk and control spend that we're making, things like the financial crime unit, things like cyber spend, things like the work we're doing around our wholesale credit operations, important things. And there are some productivity savings that play through that. And then the final piece on the volume-related is there are transactional costs that are associated with the activity that we do in the trading side. They're spend that we make in order to drive – in order to drive that activity, and the mix matters. And so while revenues kind of play out in one way for the quarter, the mix of the markets activity impacts the level of volume-related expenses that's generated through those transactions. So those are a couple of things. Again, we're consistent with guidance. We believe we're on track for the guidance we gave for the full year of mid-single digits. And we're looking forward to generating the efficiencies that come out of this spend and put a dent in our structural expense base over time.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q1,Jane Fraser,"Yeah. And let me jump in as well, Mike, because this is something Mark and I have – we're very, very aware of. We're managing it in excruciating detail on multiple dimensions. We are taking the lessons that we've got to take some of the short-term pain here in order to get us into the position we need to be in the medium term and the long term. And from the stranded costs and the divestitures we know we'll have opportunities there. We talked about at Investor Day also being in a position to simplify the management structure and take out some of the structural expenses there. So this is going to be an area of continued focus for Mark and I. But we'll make sure that not only are we managing the arc and ensuring there is one, but also that we generate the benefits from our shareholders from all of this. And it's something I feel exceedingly high accountability for, as does the management team. We get it.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,

2023,Q1,Jane Fraser,"Thank you, Jenn, hello to everyone joining us today. Well, 2023 is shaping up to be another interesting year, given the tumultuous events of the last few weeks. I am going to share some observations, and then we'll turn to what was a good quarter. First, our banking system as a whole is very strong. While a small handful of institutions still have challenges to overcome, the U.S. financial system remains unmatched globally. And I feel confident saying that as someone who has worked in many different systems around the world. The U.S. system comprises a healthy mix of community banks, regional banks and global banks including Citi. We all have important but different roles to play, serving different clients with different needs and on different scales. I would also point to the rapid response by state, federal and international regulators that helped reinforce confidence in the system at a critical juncture. I am pleased that Citi has been a source of stability for the financial system and a source of strength for our clients. We are in a position to play this role because our strategy is delivering a simpler, more focused bank. We benefit from a diversified earnings base and resilient business model. This is reinforced by our robust balance sheet management, liquidity position and strong risk management frameworks. We are disciplined in how we run the firm, from client selection to capital planning. And it is also thanks to our people. I want to express my pride in our colleagues around the world who have worked tirelessly last month to serve clients as they turned to Citi as a port in the storm. Recent events have shown that prudent asset and liability management is absolutely paramount. While Mark is going to walk you through our approach and our focus on interest rate risk, liquidity, and capital, I do want to mention a few things. In terms of assets, our loans are high-quality and short-duration. We have highly-liquid investment securities and a significant amount of cash. We have over $1 trillion of available liquidity resources, including $584 billion of HQLA and an LCR of 120%. And we maintain a diverse set of funding sources, including over $1.3 trillion of deposits across corporates, consumers, industries, and regions, many of which are operational in nature. The cornerstone is our institutional deposit base, which comprises about 60% of our deposits. Most of these deposits are particularly sticky because they sit in operating accounts that are fully integrated into how our multinational clients run their businesses around the world from their payrolls to their supply chains to their cash and liquidity management. 80% of these deposits are with clients who use all three of our integrated services- payments & collections, liquidity management and working capital solutions. The data that we aggregate from these deposits and their related flows is fundamental to how our clients manage their efficiency, risk and compliance. This greatly increases our deposit stickiness. And that is also why nearly 80% of these deposits are from client relationships that are 15 years old or more. Finally, we operate a strong risk framework that looks at both asset and liability concentrations across client segment, industry, and region, and we are confident in the size and nature of our exposures given our rigorous stress testing. We also diligently manage counterparty risk, which is critical given the interconnectedness of financial institutions. We are in a strong position to navigate whatever environment we face which is particularly relevant given the degree of uncertainty today. The Fed continues to use rate policy to battle inflation, which has been more than stubborn in services, even as we see signs of cooling in labor and manufacturing. We expect the recent events to be disinflationary and credit to contract. We believe it is now more likely that the U.S. will enter into a shallow recession later this biggest unknown is the impact on terminal short-term US interest rates and, of course, how the debt ceiling plays out. In Europe, the ECB is on a similar, but more difficult, quest to tame inflation. They have had some help from lower-than-expected energy prices and the outlook continues to be a bit brighter. However, the war in Ukraine sadly shows no sign of ending and Europe faces more structural challenges such as the need for increased defense spending, higher energy costs and fiscal burdens that will make efforts to dampen inflation and stimulate growth more difficult. In Asia, the reopening of China is adding to the momentum in the region although the Chinese consumer has been slower to rebound than expected. I saw many green shoots firsthand talking to our clients and our bankers in my various trips to India, Japan, and Hong Kong this year. We have to keep a close eye on geopolitics as the US-China relationship becomes increasingly strained and is fragmenting economic blocs. We see this translate into shifts in flows and heightened cross-border volume across TTS and our global network. of $2.19. We had good revenue growth of 6% ex-divestitures and both revenue and expenses were in line with our guidance. Our ROTCE of nearly 11% benefitted from the closing of the sales of our consumer businesses in India and Vietnam and would have been over 9% without those gains. Let me highlight our operating performance in each of our five core businesses. In Services, TTS continued to go from strength to strength, with revenues up 31%. Non-interest revenue was up 11% quarter-on-quarter-on the back of increased cross-border activity and good performance in commercial cards due to the rebound of corporate travel. Securities Servic 23% as we executed on new mandates, onboarded new AUC and benefitted from higher rates. Within Markets, our Fixed Income revenues were up 4% from a year ago. We benefitted from excellent performance in Rates and continued engagement from our corporate clients. The first quarter of 2022 was no slouch, as you may recall, but this quarter was our third-best in a decade. Equities was weaker however - down markedly in both derivatives and cash, but still had revenues north of $1 billion. Banking was down again, but there were signs of the beginning of a rebound, including increased activity in the investment grade debt market. In US Personal Banking, our cards businesses gained momentum as all drivers continue to normalize to pre COVID levels. Branded Cards and Retail Services saw revenues up 18% and 24% respectively. Retail Banking saw some growth as we continue to see good momentum in mortgages and installment lending and also experienced a significant increase in digital deposits. We did see a notable softening in consumer spending growth over the course of the quarter. Travel and entertainment continued to grow in March, but essentials were flat, and almost all other spend categories were down. Savings rates are below historic averages. While the upper quintiles of household income still have roughly a trillion dollars in excess savings, the savings of the lower quintiles have been significantly drawn down. So we are keeping a diligent eye on the lower FICO bands as economic growth and services spend slow. Finally, we remain confident about the prospects of our Wealth business. Despite the challenging headwinds, growth in Citigold accounts, client acquisition and client advisors were all solid and we expect these drivers to flow through to revenue later this year and beyond. We also saw the early signs of a long awaited Asian recovery. We built credit reserves this quarter on the back of growth in revolving balances in cards and poorer macro outlooks. NCLs continued to normalize in Consumer while the health of our corporate base was evident in another quarter of very low NCLs. Finally, we continue to generate capital through our earnings. With our CET1 ratio now at 13.4%, we have room to absorb the temporary, upfront impact should we sign a deal for Mexico. As you know, we continue to pursue a dual path here. And we are committed to increasing the amount of capital we return to our shareholders over time. As you can see from slide three, in addition to good operating performance from our businesses and, despite everything else going on in the industry, we got a lot done this quarter as we implement the strategy that we shared with you at Investor Day. We closed the sales of our consumer businesses in India and Vietnam. Indonesia and Taiwan are next on the list to close later in the year. Our Asian consumer sales will then be complete, and we are intensifying our efforts to eliminate stranded costs and simplify our organizational structure. We made some significant leadership announcements. I am delighted that Andy Sieg will join Citi at my table as the new head of Wealth Management. Andy is a widely respected leader in this space and comes to us after running an $18 billion business with $2.8 trillion in client balances. He is the latest and the most visible example of the excellent talent we have attracted over the last couple of years. With Karen Peetz retiring, we named Anand Selva as our Chief Operating Officer and asked him to take on running our enterprise-wide Transformation program in addition to his current responsibilities. Anand has been at Citi for over three decades and has a strong track record of delivering results. In terms of our Transformation, we are completely focused on executing our plans to address the consent orders and improve our risk and control environment. Mark will walk you through specific examples of how we are modernizing our infrastructure, simplifying processes, and improving data quality. Importantly, these efforts will impr relentless focus on delivering. Our strategy is clear. Our business model is resilient and diversified. Our balance sheet is strong. We are making good progress on execution. Amidst considerable turmoil, we are delivering on our guidance and our commitments. Our team is determined to continue delivering with excellence. With that, I would like to turn it over to Mark and then we would be delighted, as always, to take your questions.","billion, , revenue, liquidity, trillion, cet1",yes,Yes,cet1,Yes,lcr,No,,No,,No,,Yes,ecb,No,,Yes,"cet1 ratio, lcr"
2023,Q1,Mark Mason,"Thank you, Jane, and good morning, everyone. I am going to start with the Firmwide financial results, focusing on year-over-year comparisons for the first quarter unless I indicate otherwise, and spend a little more time on expenses, our balance sheet and capital. Then I will turn to the results of each segment. On slide 4, we show financial results for the full firm. In the first quarter, we reported net income of approximately $4.6 billion and an EPS of $2.19 and a RoTCE of nearly 11% on $21.4 billion of revenues. Embedded in these results are pre-tax divestiture-related impacts of approximately $950 million, largely driven by the gain on sale of the India consumer business. Excluding these items, EPS was $1.86 with an RoTCE of over 9%. In the quarter, total revenues increased by 12% on a reported basis and increased 6% excluding divestiture-related impacts as strength across Services, Fixed Income and .S Personal Banking was partially offset by declines in Investment Banking, Equity Markets and Wealth, as well as the revenue reduction from the closed exits and wind-downs. Our results include expenses of $13.3 billion, an increase of 1% versus the prior year. Excluding divesture related costs in the prior year, expenses increased by 5% largely driven by the transformation, other risk & control investments and inflation, partially offset by productivity savings and the expense reductions from the exits and wind-downs. Cost of credit was approximately $2.0 billion, primarily driven by the continued normalization in Card net credit losses and ACL and other provision builds of approximately $700 million, largely related to a deterioration in macroeconomic assumptions and growth in card revolving balances. At the end of the quarter, we had nearly $20 billion in total reserves with a reserve-to-funded loans ratio of approximately 2.7%. On Slide 5, we show an expense walk for the first quarter, with the key underlying drivers. Transformation investments drove ~1% of the growth largely in the data, finance and risk and control programs. And 4% of the increase is driven by structural, largely in the form of compensation and benefits including the full-year impact of the people we hired last year as well as those we hired in the first quarter. Embedded in this structural bucket are a few key items. First, other risk and control investments that are enterprise wide and in the businesses make up about 2% of the total expense increase. Second, the impact of additional front and back-office hires. Third, inflation and severance costs. All of this was partially offset by productivity savings as well as the benefit from foreign exchange translation and the expense reduction from the exits and across the firm, technology-related expenses grew 12%. We recognize these investments have driven a significant increase in expenses, but they are crucial to modernize the firm, address the consent orders and position Citi for success in the years to come. investing in and the benefits we will see over time. In many cases, these investments will simplify our processes and platforms. For example, we are retiring and consolidating 20 cash equities platforms to one single modern platform, eliminating costs over time. And we have consolidated 11 platforms to one global sanctions-screening platform, reducing false alerts, improving the client experience and eliminating costs. We are also modernizing our infrastructure and the security of our data and information by enhancing cyber security through the use of AI and improving the security of our infrastructure and devices, leading to fewer operating losses. And we are leveraging industry-leading cloud-based solutions to modernize and streamline the connectivity between our front office systems and the general ledger, eliminating manual processes and operating costs over time. We are driving the strategy by investing in the client experience both in terms of our technology interface and innovative new products. We launched our cloud-based instant payments platform for eCommerce clients in TTS. We are also deploying CitiDirect Commercial Banking, our mobile and digital interface for Commercial clients so they too can open accounts and access all products and services across ICG in the same way our Large Corporate clients do. And finally, we are investing in data to create advanced decision making, client targeting, and risk management capabilities which has allowed us to enhance our returns through greater RWA efficiency. And we expect many of these investments to generate efficiencies that will allow us to self-fund future investments over time. first quarter, net interest income increased by approximately $80 million, largely driven by interest-earning balances in cards. Average loans were up slightly as growth in PBWM was largely offset by a decline in ICG. Average deposits were also up slightly, driven by growth in both PBWM and ICG. And our net interest margin increased 2 basis points. On Slide 8, we show key consumer and corporate credit metrics. We are well reserved for the current environment with nearly $20 billion of reserves. Our reserves-to-funded loans ratio is approximately 2.7%. And within that, US Cards is 8.1%. In PBWM, 44% of our lending exposures are in US cards and of that exposure, nearly 80% is to customers with FICOs of 680 or higher. And NCL rates, while reflecting some typical seasonality this quarter, are still below pre-COVID levels and are normalizing in line with our expectations. The remaining 56% of our PBWM lending exposure is largely in Wealth and predominantly mortgages and margin lending. In our ICG portfolio, of our total exposure, approximately 85% is investment grade. Of the international exposure, approximately 90% is investment grade or exposure to multinational clients or their subsidiaries. And corporate non-accrual loans remain low at about 40 basis points of total loans. As you can see on the page, we break out our Commercial Real Estate lending exposures across ICG and PBWM which total $66 billion, of which 90% is investment grade. So, while the macro and geopolitical environment remains uncertain, we feel very good about our asset quality, exposures and reserve levels and we continuously review and stress the portfolio under a range of scenarios. additional metrics to the page to provide additional transparency into how we manage the balance sheet. We maintain a very strong $2.5 trillion balance sheet which is funded in part by a well-diversified $1.3 trillion deposit base across regions, industries, customers and account types which is deployed into high quality, diversified assets. Our balance sheet is a reflection of our strategy and well diversified business model. We leverage our unique assets and capabilities to serve corporates, financial institutions, investors, and individuals with global needs. First, the majority of our deposits, $819 billion, are institutional, and span 90 countries. And the majority of these institutional deposits tend to be interest rate sensitive so when rates go up, we reprice the deposits accordingly, but that reprice takes into account the overall client relationship as well as the level of rates. But despite this interest rate sensitivity, these deposits tend to be stable as they are tied to the operational services we provide. And these institutional deposits are complemented by $437 billion of US Retail consumer and global wealth deposits as you can see on the bottom right side of the page. These deposits are well diversified across the Private Bank, Citigold, Retail and Wealth at Work as well as across regions and products, with 75% of US Citigold clients and approximately 50% of ultra-high net worth clients having been with Citi for more than 10 years. Our wealth deposits tend to also be interest rate sensitive, but this usually results in our customers moving to higher-yielding investment and deposit products. Now turning to the asset side, at a high-level, you can think about our deposits being largely deployed in three asset buckets loans, investment securities and cash which complement the interest rate sensitivity and liquidity value of our liabilities. And this deployment is also linked to our strategy we use our resources to lend and transact with our clients in ways that deepen the relationship and drive returns for our shareholders while maintaining strong liquidity and capital. Our $652 billion loan portfolio is well diversified across consumer and corporate loans. And the duration of the total portfolio is approximately 1.3 years as the majority of these loans are variable-rate. About 35% of our balance sheet is in cash and investment securities which contribute to our $1 trillion of available liquidity resources. And at the end of the quarter, we had an LCR of 120%, which means we have roughly $100 billion of HQLA in excess of the amount required by the rule to cover stressed outflows. And you can see the details of this on page 27 in the appendix. But just as important as the quantum of liquidity is the composition and duration of that liquidity. And our $513 billion investment portfolio consists largely of highly liquid US Treasury, Agency and other sovereign bonds, and is split evenly between available-for-sale and held-to maintained a short duration of less than three years so we could benefit from higher interest rates. And we actively and prudently manage our assets and liabilities by considering a range of possible stress scenarios and how they might impact interest rate risk, liquidity, and capital. So, in summary, our assets and liabilities are aligned across interest rate sensitivity, liquidity value and duration, and reflect the diversified business model and execution of our strategy. On Slide 10, we show a sequential CET1 walk to provide more detail on the drivers this quarter. Walking from the end of fourth quarter. First, we generated $4.3 billion of net income to common which added 38 basis points. Second, we returned $1.0 billion in the form of common dividends, which drove a reduction of about 9 basis points. Third, impact on AOCI through our AFS investment portfolio drove a 7 basis point increase. And finally, the remaining 4 basis point increase was largely driven by the RWA benefit from closing our consumer exits. We ended the quarter with a 13.4% CET1 capital ratio, approximately 40 basis points higher than last quarter, and this includes a 100 basis point internal management buffer. And as it relates to buybacks, we did not buy back any stock this quarter and we will continue to make that decision on a quarter-by-quarter basis. On Slide 11, we show the results for our Institutional Clients Group for the first quarter. Revenues were up 1% this quarter, largely driven by Services and Fixed income, mostly offset by Investment Banking and Equities. Expenses increased 4%, driven by transformation, other risk and control investments and volume-related expenses, partially offset by FX translation and productivity savings. Cost of credit was a $72 million benefit, as an ACL release more than offset net credit losses. This resulted in net income of approximately $3.3 billion, up 23%, driven by the lower cost of credit and higher revenues, partially offset by higher expenses. ICG delivered a 13.8% RoTCE for the quarter. And average loans were down 2% reflecting discipline around our strategy and returns. Average deposits were up 3% as we continued to acquire new clients and deepen relationships with existing ones. And sequentially, average deposits were up 1%. And on an end of period basis, ICG deposits were down 3% sequentially, driven by seasonality as our clients tend to make tax payments in the first quarter. On Slide 12, we show revenue performance by business and the key drivers we laid out at Investor Day. In Treasury and Trade Solutions, revenues were up 31%, driven by 41% growth in net interest income and 13% in NIR, with growth across all client segments. We continue to see healthy underlying drivers in TTS that indicate consistently strong client activity with US Dollar Clearing Volumes up 6%, reflecting continued SWIFT share gains. Cross-border flows up 10%, outpacing global GDP growth. Commercial card volumes up roughly 40%, led by spend in travel. So, while the rate environment drove about 60% of the growth this quarter, business actions drove the remaining 40%, as we continued to deepen relationships with existing clients and win new clients. In fact, client wins are up approximately 50%, across all segments. These include marquee transactions where we In Securities Services, revenues grew 23% as net interest income grew 94%, driven by higher interest rates across currencies, partially offset by a 6% decrease in non-interest revenue due to the impact of market valuations. We are pleased with the execution in Securities Services as we continue to onboard assets under custody and administration from significant client wins and we feel very good about the pipeline of new deals. As a reminder, the Services businesses are central to our strategy and are two of our higher returning businesses with strong linkages across the firm. Markets revenues were down 4% as growth in Fixed Income was more than offset by Equities. Fixed Income revenues were up 4%, relative to a very strong quarter last year, as strength in our Rates franchise was partially offset by a decline in FX and Commodities. Equities revenues were down 25%, also relative to a strong quarter last year, primarily reflecting reduced client activity in Cash and Equity Derivatives. Corporate client flows remained strong and stable and we continued to make solid progress on our revenue-to-RWA target And finally, Banking revenues, excluding gains and losses on loan hedges, were down 21%, driven by Investment Banking, as heightened macro uncertainty and volatility continued to impact client activity. Having said that, we do see revenue growth sequentially largely driven by the investment grade market opening up. So overall, while the market environment remains challenging, we feel good about the progress we are making in ICG. Now turning to Slide 13, we show the results for our Personal Banking & Wealth Management business. Revenues were up 9%, driven by net interest income growth of 10%, partially offset by a 1% decline in non interest revenue, driven by lower investment product revenues in Wealth. Expenses were also up 9%, predominantly driven by investments in transformation and other risk and control initiatives. Cost of credit was $1.6 billion, driven by higher net credit losses as we continue to see normalization in our card portfolios and a reserve build of approximately $500 million, largely driven by a deterioration in macroeconomic assumptions and card revolving balance growth. Average loans increased 7% driven by cards, mortgages and installment lending. Average deposits decreased 3%, largely reflecting our Wealth clients putting cash to work in fixed income investments on our platform. And PBWM delivered an RoTCE of 5.5%, largely driven by higher credit costs. On Slide 14, we show PBWM revenues by product as well as key business drivers and metrics. Branded Cards revenues were up 18%, driven by higher net interest income. We continue to see strong underlying drivers with new account acquisitions up 17%, card spend volumes up 9% and average loans up 15%. Retail Services revenues were up 24%, also driven by higher net interest income. For both Card portfolios, we continue to see payment rates decline, and that combined with the investments we have been making contributed to growth in interest-earning balances of 18% in Branded Cards and 11% in Retail Services. Retail Banking revenues were up 3%, primarily driven by higher mortgage revenue and strong growth in personal installment lending, partially offset by the impact of the transfer of relationships and the associated deposits to our Wealth business. In fact, consistent with the strategy, we continued to leverage our retail network to drive over 13,000 Wealth referrals in the first quarter. Wealth revenues were down 9%, driven by continued investment fee headwinds and higher deposit costs particularly in the Private Bank. However, we did see notable improvement in revenues in Asia which were up approximately 20% on a sequential basis. Client advisors were up 3%. And we are seeing net new investment inflows and strong new client acquisitions across our Wealth business, with new clients in the Private Bank and Wealth at Work up 62% and 81%, respectively. While the environment continues to remain challenging for Wealth, we are seeing strong underlying business drivers as we execute against our strategy. On Slide 15, we show results for Legacy Franchises. Revenues grew 48%, driven by a gain on the sale of our consumer business in India, partially offset by the wind-downs and closed consumer exits. Expenses decreased 24%, largely driven by the absence of a goodwill impairment we had in the prior year as well as the impact of the wind-downs and closed consumer exits. On Slide 16, we show results for Corporate Other for the first quarter. Revenues increased, largely driven by higher net revenue from the investment portfolio. Expenses increased, driven by transformation and other risk and control investments, partially offset by a reduction in consulting fees. . Despite recent events and the economic uncertainty that remains, our full-year outlook for revenue and expenses remains unchanged. We have a very strong balance sheet with a diversified set of assets and funding sources with ample capital and liquidity, which positions us well to serve clients and navigate any number of scenarios. We are seeing solid momentum in the underlying drivers of the majority of our businesses and continue to execute on our strategy. The financial path will not be linear, but we are confident we can achieve our medium-term targets in a variety of scenarios. help our clients navigate the recent environment and support the health of the overall banking system And with that, Jane and I would be happy to take your questions.","capital ratio, billion, , revenue, net income, liquidity, million, trillion, net interest income, cet1",yes,Yes,"cet1, capital ratio",Yes,lcr,Yes,reserve build,No,,No,,No,,No,,Yes,"lcr, net interest margin"
2023,Q1,"Question Andanswer
Operator",Ourfirst question will come from Glenn Schorr with Evercore. Your line is now open.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Glenn Schorr,"Hi, thank you, a simple one. I appreciate the many, many moving parts, but your first quarter NII and revenue production was great, and if you just annualize it, you're handily ahead of your full year guide. So I'm just curious on how you're thinking about maintaining the guide but running ahead of schedule.",revenue,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Mark Mason,"Yeah, thanks, Glenn, and good morning. Appreciate the question. Look, we did have a very solid first quarter, but as Jane mentioned in her prepared remarks, there are a number of things that are still out there in the global macro environment that are uncertain and unclear, including, frankly, as we contemplate the direction of rates and what's required to tame inflation, let alone the uncertainty that we've seen in parts of the sector here through the quarter. And so when I think about that and I think about how frankly betas have evolved and the likelihood of a recession in the back half of the year, which we have built into our outlook, I remain comfortable with the guidance that we've set here. And when you think about where that comes from, the strength in TTS, the strength in Securities Services, both benefiting from the rate hikes we saw last year, but also deepening relationships with new and existing clients, the Card momentum, which is really about seeing more revolving activity as payment rates start to slow, and the recovery in Investment Banking and Wealth is not as swift as we would like and so we have to see how that plays out too. So when I put those things together, there's certainly some puts and takes that speaks to the diversification of our business model, but it leaves me in a place where I'm comfortable with the guidance that we've set, and if that changes, we'll certainly update you, but that's where we are.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Glenn Schorr,"I appreciate that. Maybe if I could follow-up on your comments,the previous ones on TTS and Securities Services. I try to learn from all my mistakes, I make a lot of them, but in 2008 we thought housing prices couldn't go down much, and then they went down a lot, and we all adapt. The same thing in March, thought deposits couldn't leave a bank so quickly, but they did. So, slide 25 and 26 people should look at because they're great and they show the stability of your deposit franchise, but I'm curious if history can change at all. Meaning right now, those are cash and operating deposits that clients keep with you and they need you, and you're fully integrated, but do you have client concentrations we should know about or are you thinking about any big changes that can happen in terms of client behavior relative to the past in terms of what they keep at any given bank? I know it's a tough one.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Jane Fraser,"Glenn, I'll kick it off and pass it over to Mark. I feel very comfortable about how very well diversified our deposit base is across different countries, industries, clients, and currencies. It's extremely strong in that respect, and as you say, the majority of the Institutional deposits are integrated into the operating accounts all around the world to enable the clients to run their day-to-day operations, the payroll, the working capital, the supplier financing, et cetera. And I think what's changed in the more digital world is frankly these have become even stickier because the amount of data, the extent of integration into the technology platforms and systems of the clients and the value that we extract and present back to the clients from the combination of our FX trade, cash, et cetera, flows, is incredibly important in driving their efficiency, their risk management, and their financial performance as well. So both the extent of that diversification and the increasing stickiness versus history is something that we're certainly not complacent about, but I think is why you see from the pages we've put into the deck as well including in the back on just the consistency of this base. Mark, what would you add?",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Mark Mason,"I think that's exactly right, Jane, and Glenn, I'm glad you pointed out pages 25 and 26 which clearly lay out that diversification but also the scale and stability of those deposits over an extended period of time. The only thing I'd add additional to that would be obviously we're in an environment where there's quantitative tightening that's occurring. That's going to have a broad industry impact as we've started to see already, but we're also in an environment where rates are increasing. We'll see how that plays out through the balance of the year. That has an impact on betas, but we shouldn't mistake price-sensitivity or interest rate sensitivity with the stickiness of the deposits. And so we've obviously talked about betas increasing particularly in our TTS portfolio, more so in the US. It obviously will continue to increase outside of the US, but we'll work the relationship that we have with those clients and the breadth of services that we bring to influence and impact pricing, and more importantly, because of the operating nature of them, we do see them as very stable.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Operator,"Thank you. Our next question will come from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is open. Can you talk about for the fee growth? I mean, we kind of understand the NII growth, but the fee growth is double-digits also, so I guess that's money in motion and I think you described this as the world's largest wholesale global payments system. What's happening to give you double-digit top line growth there?",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Jane Fraser,"Oh, thank you, Mike, and a great question. I think one of the numbers I'm almost more happy about than the stellar revenue growth was the fee growth quarter-over-quarter here because obviously, we've been benefiting in TTS from the rates environment but we've also been benefiting from the drivers behind the franchise. And the fee revenues are coming from multiple different products and different offerings that we have here, and we're typically looking and have consistently looked at growing our fee revenue as a percentage of the underlying growth in TTS. It got masked a bit when the rates environment was growing so much, but the different areas there around the world are making a big difference to the strength of our earnings and the quality of our earnings in these areas.",revenue,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Mike Mayo,"Okay. And then as it relates to rates generally, what is it, like, over 90% of your rate sensitivity is outside the US, and so shouldn't you be benefiting more than you originally thought given some of these rate hikes? And I guess, Mark, are you just sandbagging a little bit? I get the uncertainties and the IB backlog pushed out, and, no I mean, we want you to have a reasonable bar to jump over and I'm just wondering if you set the bar high enough for yourself for this year.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Mark Mason,"Yeah, so again, I think that there is certainly more opportunity in terms of how rates move and capturing NII as you pointed out outside of the US. We articulate our interest rate exposure for a parallel shift and that mix at the end of last year was the 90/10 that you mentioned for non-US. As I sit here in March, it probably is going to skew a little bit less non-US and a little bit more towards the US, and you'll see that in the 10-Q. With that said, I mentioned earlier, there's still a bit of uncertainty in terms of how rates continue to evolve here in the US. We'll see how betas evolve. We've reached terminal betas in the US with our clients kind of at the end of last year, and so we'll see kind of what happens in terms of pricing through the balance of 2023. Betas are not quite at terminal levels outside of the US, and so we'll see the pacing of that, again, in light of how the interest rate curve may be evolving and frankly in light of how we've seen the broader sector turmoil play out. That could in fact play to our benefit. But we are also, again, in an environment where there's quantitative tightening that is still at play. And then the final point I'd make, Mike, that often people forget is that in that NII is Legacy NII, and so as we continue with our wind-downs, our divestitures, et cetera, that's going to be a headwind that we will have to deal with.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Operator,Thank you. Our next question will come from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Betsy Graseck,"Hi, good morning. I know during the prepared remarks you talked a bit about Andy Sieg coming on board, and I just wanted to understand how to think about the outlook for what you're doing with Wealth, not only in the US but the non-US locations, and also try to understand how much capital you think you could apply to that business relative to what you have today. Thanks.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Jane Fraser,"Hey there Betsy. So, we're obviously delighted that Andy is joining as our new Global Head of Wealth around my table, and he's a tremendous leader with a great track record driving growth. He's got deep product and digital expertise; a proven people leader and we'll certainly be taking full advantage of his expertise and experience in the US. We're not shifting our strategy in Wealth. His mandate is consistent with the strategy we laid out at Investor Day. We see a lot of potential of growth in Asia as we fill in the coverage across the full wealth spectrum there. We'll be scaling up in the US by building out the investment offering and cross-selling into our existing and new clients across the country. We see tremendous potential of growth in our Private Bank and the family office franchise really around the world, and there's a lot of synergies to be realized as we point out in the different KPIs and drivers between the other four core businesses in terms of referrals and other business that we're able to generate across the franchise. So the core of the strategy will not be changing with him coming on board. Mark, what else would you add in?",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Mark Mason,"The only thing I'd add is that, we are, I think, well-positioned for as the market recovers and it plays towards Wealth. When you look at kind of the client advisors, as you know, we've been investing in bringing on new client advisors. We've been increasing the number of new clients that we've been onboarding as well. We've invested in some of the investment products that we have, and so I feel like we are positioning ourselves for when this turns. And as it relates to your question regarding capital, this in a normal cycle is a very healthy returning business, and as the market turns and as we recover, we would look to deploy capital appropriate with the growth and return prospects that we see in front of us. It's also not as much of a capital-intensive business as other businesses, and so I think you've got to keep both of those things in mind.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Operator,Thank you. Our next question will come from Erika Najarian with UBS. Your line is open.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Erika Najarian,"Hi. Good morning. And I think it's remarkable that your first two questions were essentially saying that your revenues are too conservative, so that's very notable for a Citi call. My first question is a follow-up to Betsy. I think everybody were certainly impressed, Jane, at the Andy Sieg hire, and clearly, he was running a much larger business than what Citi has today. And this is sort of a tricky question. Clearly, you're still working through some of the transformation. There's still a consent order, but given your strength as a global player, could Citi participate in perhaps inorganic opportunities that could be out there, having a result perhaps of the liquidity crisis that we saw that could potentially enhance your Wealth Management footprint more quickly?",liquidity,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Jane Fraser,"We see plenty of potential for organic growth potential, and I think that's really where we're going to be focusing, Erika, because I look at the Private Bank and the family office, there is so much wealth creation supplemented by our Commercial Banking relationships with a lot of the enterprises and the owners of those enterprises who are really generating the new industry champions in country after country, and we're extremely well-positioned to capture that. I don't see an inorganic play that would actually help us on it. We also benefit because we don't have our own proprietary products and a sales force pushing those proprietary products. We're an open architecture, and therefore, we're a very desirable partner for many of our key partners on the Institutional side of the business to be able to provide very interesting value propositions, investment opportunities and the like to our clients around the world. And finally, we can see certainly areas in interesting digital plays, different partnerships, areas like that that are of interest. So I'll never say never in the longer-run. I'm sure if something very attractive comes up, we'll be very interested and looking at it, but it's not something right now that I think makes sense, given where we're focused. Actually almost independent of the consent orders, I think what we're looking at doing right now is getting this organic play right and then we'll see from there.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Mark Mason,"00 referralsfrom our Retail Bank to the Wealth space or to our Wealth business, and there's a lot of embedded opportunity and it really speaks to the integrated model that we've been talking about.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Jane Fraser,"And I think the other bit I'd also just point to is I think one of the things we do benefit from is that we aren't constrained by being dominated by a brokerage model in a particular way of doing Wealth, so part of the mandate for Andy and the ones that we've been working on to date is really looking at what is modern Wealth Management and making sure that we are really well-positioned that way, because I do think that will be more of the way of the future.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Operator,Thank you. Our next question will come from Jim Mitchell with Seaport Global. Your line is open.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Jim Mitchell,"Hey, good morning. Maybe just a question on capital. Appreciate the fact that the potential sale of the Mexico franchise would be a negative impact, but you're sitting at a pretty comfortable cushion now above your target. Obviously your expected future retained earnings growth should be more than an offset, so how do we think about, how are you thinking about the timing of restarting buybacks with your stock as cheap as it is?",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Mark Mason,"Yeah, thanks, Jim, and good morning. As you point out, we grew capital pretty sizably this quarter, up to 13.4% from a CET1 ratio point of view and up significantly from a year ago, some 200 basis points or so. And a good portion of that, a significant portion of that, was really net income earnings generation, which is important. Look, the way we think about it is that 13.4%, we certainly have well-above what's required from a regulatory point of view and it includes our internal management buffer of about 100 basis points. But as we've said in the past, there is certainly the Mexico transaction and that would be a temporary drag to CET1 at signing, the difference between signing and closing if it were a sale to take place. And then there are a couple of other factors that are out there as well. So think about the Basel III end game that's out there and the capital requirements that could come out of that. Think about the CCAR DFAST that has been submitted and currently under review, and what that might mean for stress capital buffers, and also think about just where we are in the broader economy and broader global macro environment that we're playing in and needing to see how that kind of evolves. And so when I think about all of those factors, we're in a place where we will continue to take it quarter-by-quarter, but I'd end by saying our bias is kind of where yours is, which is given where we're trading, all things being equal, we'd like to be buying back shares, but we have to be responsible about that and the timing of that.","net income, cet1",yes,Yes,cet1,No,,No,,Yes,"ccar, dfast",No,,No,,Yes,basel iii,Yes,cet1 ratio
2023,Q1,Jane Fraser,"I think we'll have more clarity fairly soon around a number of the factors, so we'll be able to give you better clarity on timing before too long.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Jim Mitchell,"Yeah, all fair. And then maybe as a follow-up, just, you mentioned increased macro assumptions embedded in reserves. Where are you now on the macro assumptions in the reserve book?",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Markmason,"So in terms of the reserve, again, remember we have a couple of different scenarios that we run when we calculate the CECL reserves. Our current reserves are based on those three macroeconomic scenarios. It reflects a 5.1% or so unemployment rate on a weighted basis over eight quarters, so that's relatively flat versus last quarter. The other point worth mentioning is that in this particular calculation for the quarter, we did skew a little bit more towards the downside in terms of the probability weighting than last quarter, in light of the macro environment and the combination of that as well as some normalization in the portfolio including an increase in revolver activity contributed to the increase in reserves we saw. But to answer your question, unemployment at about 5.1% for the weighted basis over the eight quarters.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Operator,Our next question will come from Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research. Your line is open.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Steven Chubak,"Hey, good morning. So I wanted to start off with a question just on the IB and trading outlook. On the trading side, just given some of the recent macro shocks, have you seen any evidence of bad volatility and are you still confident that you can sustain that mid-single-digit growth target? And just on the Investment Banking side, I wanted to see if there's any evidence of green shoots. It's been a challenging backdrop, as you noted, Mark, but I was hoping you could offer some color just across some of the different product lines, across M&A, ECM, DCM.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Mark Mason,"Why don't I start, and then, Jane, feel free to jump in. Look, we saw better performance in the quarter in Markets than when I talked at the conference earlier in the quarter. And really that played through in our Fixed Income business which was up about 4% year-over-year driven largely by strength in Rates and we saw rate volatility in the back end of the quarter and we were well-positioned to take advantage of that and serve clients and that aided getting us to down 4% in aggregate across Markets. What we talked about for the full year is kind of relatively flat performance, and I still think that based on what we see today and subject to how the macro continues to evolve that we'll be able to deliver on that. But as you know, volatility in many instances plays to the favor of Markets businesses, and so there's a bit of an unknown as to how that evolves. But I feel confident in the guidance that we've given thus far on that.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Jane Fraser,"Yeah, I'd jump in before you turn to Banking as well. I think one of the differences with our franchise compared to some others is that we are the go-to bank for corporates, and that provides a highly attractive but pretty steady flow of activity. This is obviously in the volatile markets we've been seeing is from our perspective very good volatility because we're able to support our clients in rates, FX, commodity hedging, and it makes our risk flows much more diversified than our competitors particularly in volatile markets like this. We're not taking positions. This is really attractive client flow business right at the heart of the global network. The other piece that I think is important in the mix here too is just the partnership with TTS, cross-border payments, these other elements and cornerstone of the FX franchise, so there's some pieces here of the volatility that one doesn't usually think of this as being so client-heavy, but that's what's differentiating on the Citi franchise. Mark, back to you.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Mark Mason,"No, thank you, I think that's exactly right in terms of the corporate client base there. Look, in Investment Banking, obviously the wallets were down meaningfully last year. We saw some good performance in debt capital markets this quarter, up 66% versus the prior quarter, particularly as we saw activity in the investment grade names, which is an area of strength for us for sure, and I think there was a bit of momentum behind a bit more clarity on the direction of rates, and so we'll see how that continues to evolve and play out. The other thing I'd add is that we continue to have very good dialogue with clients as they manage through the environment and try to anticipate what the balance of the year looks like, and at some point, it's clear that clients are going to need to get back into the markets, but that trajectory is going to largely depend on the geopolitical and macro environment and how we all manage and navigate that uncertainty. So very engaged, healthy pipeline, but subject to how the environment continues to evolve.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Steven Chubak,"That's great. And for my follow-up, just on PBWM fee income trends, I'm not going to ask you about the broader Wealth strategy, but we're big fans of Andy here, so congrats on the hire. The one thing I did want to get a better sense of is how much of the sequential improvement that we saw in fees is a function of just partner payments being higher as credit continues to normalize, and how we should be thinking about the trajectory in fees within PBWM over the remainder of this year?",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Mark Mason,"I think there are a couple of things to kind of keep in mind in terms of PBWM fees, and I think part of it is that PBWM is a combination of both the Cards business as well as the Wealth business, and a good amount of the pressure that we've seen in fees and that is still subject to how the environment evolves is in the Wealth space, because we continue to see fee pressure on investment activity and revenues there, and we'll have to see how the market valuations move on some of the assets that we manage on behalf of clients and what momentum it drives in terms of more investment activity. So I think that's a big part of the drag in fees. The upside that we've seen in fees in Banking and Cards, again, I think will be subject to how activity and volume evolves across our Cards business. We do expect revolving levels to continue, but purchase sales while they're up year-over-year, when we look at kind of the latter months of the quarter, the growth has been slowing, and has been quite concentrated in travel and entertainment. So we'll have to see how some of that volume activity evolves, and that'll be a factor to keep in mind.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Operator,Thank you. Our next question will come from Ebrahim Poonawala from Bank of America. Your line is open.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Ebrahim Poonawala,"Hey, good afternoon. Just a couple of quick questions. One, in terms of the Banamex sale, I think, Jane, you mentioned that maybe we might hear something relatively soon and you still are pursuing the dual track process. One, if you do decide to go the IPO route, does that change the accounting dynamics, Mark, with regards to taking that hit early on if given just the time it might take to go through an IPO. And the outlook for the Mexican economy, the banks continue to be robust. Is that impacting or influencing how you're thinking about the value that you should get from this transaction?",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Jane Fraser,"So, we're in a very active dialogue right now in Mexico, so neither Mark nor I are going to comment in a lot of detail there. As you say, we're continuing to pursue a dual path, both a sale and an IPO, so we'll have an exit strategy either way, and we'll take the path that is in the best interest of our shareholders. So we've got an enormous body of work going on in Mexico to separate out the Institutional business. I'm pleased with the progress they're making. I think we're seeing, when we look at the performance of our Mexican franchise, a lot of the really strong performance is happening in our ICG business where Mexico is such a beneficiary of the supply chain dynamics that are happening around the world, and its location is obviously very beneficial given the proximity to the US as well. So I think a lot of the dynamic and the big benefits here coming in the institutional franchise that we're keeping within Citi as a core part of our business. So the current Mexican economy doesn't really have so much of an impact on our current decision-making. The principle is we will take the path that is in the best interest of our shareholders.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Mark Mason,"Yeah, and just to put some numbers to that, for the quarter, Mexico was up 16% revenue year-over-year. Quarter-over-quarter up 5%, cards growth, deposit growth, so performing well I would say. And in terms of the latter part of your question, Jane's exactly right. Everything we're doing is positioning us for both a private sale and/or an IPO, and we'll choose the path that's best for shareholders. An IPO would take longer. It would likely take longer as we would want a set of full audited financials, et cetera. I would say that in terms of what the implications would be from an accounting point of view, CTA accounting is different for an IPO so we would not recognize that CTA through the P&L in an IPO. We wouldn't have at signing that impact that is different from that closing and so that would not be an issue. The impact would be a matter of how much we IPO-ed at that time, so a lot of moving pieces there. We would need to figure out if we ended up down that path, but hopefully that gives you some sense of the scenarios there. But I'd end with just one final point that Jane has made already, which is that the outcome that we choose will be the best outcome for our shareholders, our clients, and employees.",revenue,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Jane Fraser,And that will be an exit.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Operator,"Thank you. Our next question will come from Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. :Hello. You guys have talked about bending the curve on costs I think in the latter part of 2024, and I wanted to see if that's still the case. And I guess maybe just some clarification on what bending the curve means. Is that slowing expense growth, absolute drop, any kind of clarity on that, and costs in general kind of medium-term would be helpful. Thank you.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Mark Mason,"Thank, Matt. To answer your question very directly, yes, it is still the case. We are going to bend the curve, as I mentioned, towards the end of 2024. It does mean an absolute dollar reduction in expenses. Okay. That's helpful. And then, I think in the past you've kind of insinuated that's like the start of hopefully a more material drop in costs beyond, obviously this is far away, but just any additional color there too. Thank you.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Mark Mason,"Yeah, look, again, look, the expense base is a key area of focus for us, right? We recognize that expenses have been growing. They've been growing because we've been investing in the franchise both transformation-wise as well as business-led growth to support the competitive advantages that we have in many of our franchises, but we're managing that very actively and very deliberately, and that means that we're looking to ensure that we're spending the money in the right way in the right places and that we're going to yield the benefits that we expect from that over time. And that was all factored into the targets that we set at our Investor Day for the medium-term, and what that requires is that we start bending the curve in 2024 as I stated and that we end in that medium-term at a place where we have an operating efficiency of about 60% and we're positioned to have returns that are in that 11% to 12% RoTCE point of view. There are a couple of factors that are going to contribute to lowering that expense base. One, the divestitures that we've been talking about, right. The second is the benefits from the transformation and other investments that I've just referenced. And the third is further organizational and management simplification efforts that we have underway that are enabled by the idea that we're exiting 14 consumer countries. And so those three factors, if you will, become very important to ensure that we get to that lower cost structure and that we're able to deliver on the broader commitments that we're making with regards to returns.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Operator,Thank you.Our next question will come from Gerard Cassidy with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Gerard Cassidy,"Thank you. Hi, Jane. Hi, Mark. A couple questions. Jane, maybe starting with you first, or Mark, both of you can answer it. In view of what the disruptions we've seen in the banking system in the month of March with what went on with the regional banks here in the US and obviously the large investment bank over in Switzerland, do you guys see changes coming, or what changes do you see coming in terms of regulatory whether it's more capital, more liquidity, and it may not be directed at a company like yours because you're a global SIFI already and it might be more regionally orientated in the United States. And as part of this question, Jane, can you guys give us some color on the deposit you and your peers made into First Republic? What was the thinking behind that as well?",liquidity,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,Yes,sifi,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Jane Fraser,"Sure. Thank you for the question, Gerard. Well, I'd say that we hope that there will be a thoughtful and targeted approach to any changes in the regulatory and capital framework and that they address the root causes of what actually happened here, and what happened is a combination of macro impacts from the sharp, rapid rate increases and some idiosyncratic situations, namely a lack of proper asset and liability management at a small handful of banks. We don't see these issues as pervasive throughout the broader banking industry, but the events certainly highlight the importance of prudent asset and liability management. We still believe that there is plenty of capital amongst the large banks, and if capital requirements were to increase for the large banks by the regulators it would exacerbate any credit tightening that might go on. And related to that, what continues to keep me most awake at night is the quantity and quality of activity in the shadow banking industry. It does not benefit from the same regulatory frameworks and protections for participants, and I, amongst others, fear that more activity getting driven into it, if the banking capital requirements increase, will be to the detriment of system strength and stability. So we hope that this approach will be thoughtful and targeted to where the issues actually were. As I said in my opening comments, we thought that the regulators both at the local and national and the international level were swift and effective in making sure that they tackled the issues that were in front and we were absolutely delighted that the large banks acted as a source of strength. And let's just step back for a minute. In the face of tremendous market uncertainty, 11 of the largest US banks were able to come together to inject $30 billion of deposits into First Republic in a little over one day, and that speaks volumes for our capital and balance sheet positions, and I think the responsibility of large institutions in recognizing that we also play an important role here in helping stabilize situations like this. We thought it was very important to help buy some time and also demonstrate our confidence in the overall US banking system. So, I hope that gives you a bit of a flavor.",billion,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Gerard Cassidy,"No, very, very insightful. Very good. Thank you. And then as a follow-up question, I noticed in your Card, I think it was slide 8, you give us the prime, 80% of the portfolio is prime, which is FICO scores greater than 680. I don't know if you would agree with this statement, but we're hearing that there was some FICO score inflation as a result of the pandemic. A lot of consumers saw their FICO scores go up, and I've seen numbers as high as 70 points, that may be on the high side, but can you guys, do you agree with that, and if you do, would you then expect the 700 FICO score customer at some point to behave like a 650 score customer?",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Jane Fraser,"I think the short answer is no, but let me let Mark answer that one.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Mark Mason,"I think what's really important here, Gerard, is kind of what we're seeing in the way of the performance of the portfolio. So again, I've heard that sentiment regarding FICO score inflation. We feel very confident in how we've assessed our customers and what it means to have 80% of our customers prime and greater than 680. I think importantly, what we're seeing is we're seeing payment rates start to slow. We're seeing average interest-earning balances start to increase. We're seeing NCL rates increase, but particularly driven by the lower FICO score customers across the portfolio which is where you would expect to start to see that drag occur, and the NCL rates that we're seeing are still well below what we would see in a normal cycle and they're in line with what we've been forecasting for performance. So there are no surprises that we're seeing in terms of how that curve is evolving. We'd expect that it will get back to those normal levels towards the beginning of next year. It will likely play through those normal levels a bit before tapering. But my point here is that we understand our customers, the portfolio, and how it reacts to the environment enough to forecast that out, and so far, that's been performing in line with that forecast and those estimates. And importantly, we continue to stress it to make sure we're not missing anything and importantly, we carry a sizable reserve, as you know, as part of that $20 billion.",billion,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Jane Fraser,"I'd also add that we don't just rely on FICO scores for assessing the credit of our customers and our portfolio. There's a tremendous amount of data that we draw upon that goes well, well beyond that, and that's also, as you can imagine, something that gives a lot more confidence is it's not just prior history, it's a wealth of data that is used.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Operator,Thank you. Our next question will come from Vivek Juneja with JPMorgan. Your line is open.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Vivek Juneja,"Thank you. Thanks for taking my questions, Mark and Jane. Mark, I want to go to your revenue, I hear you, you're keeping the revenue guidance unchanged. What is in your revenue assumption, just want to unpeel that onion a little bit. What's in your revenue assumption for rates, US and internationally, and what is going on with deposit betas particularly following the inflows you've seen recently in the US with the crisis? The second point I'd make is around non-US rates. We're assuming, I don't have specifics in front of me in terms of the rate curves around the globe, but we are assuming continued rate increases there. Not of a significant magnitude, but some assumptions there depending on where we're talking about. The beta assumptions that we have built in are for betas to continue to increase outside of the US, but again, they run lower than the US in general for our multinational clients. We expect that we will see in the PBWM Retail Banking, or the PBWM client segment space that clients are likely to move towards either higher-yielding deposit products or investment products, and so we've factored those things into how we think about the outlook. And could that change or evolve? Absolutely. But that's kind of what's behind what we've assumed here.",revenue,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Vivek Juneja,"And just as a clarification, with the inflows you've seen recently in deposits with the crisis, this is in the US, obviously, are the betas tempering a little bit, how much those are going up? Is that slowing down, or not any change so far?",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Mark Mason,"So a couple things I mentioned. So one, we did see inflows in the quarter associated with some of the sector turmoil. We've looked at kind of deposit levels from call it March 7th, March 8th through close to the end of March, and we certainly did see an uptick, call it probably a little bit under $30 billion or so of inflows in that period of time, with a good portion of that in our CCB, our Commercial Middle-Market client base. It's too soon to tell kind of how betas evolve, but we do think that a good portion of those deposits will likely be sticky. I think what's important here is that part of our strategy here is in fact growing operating deposits with our large multinational clients and our middle-market clients, and so we're going to continue to be focused on that. What's a little bit unclear is how the rate environment continues to evolve and what that means for how betas actually evolve, and we'll have to kind of wait and see. It's too soon to tell as it relates to that.",billion,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Operator,Thank you. Our next question will come from Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Your line is open.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Ken Usdin,"Thanks. Hey, Mark, just a follow-up on the credit. So you mentioned obviously that you moved your part of your CECL adjustment a little bit in your weightings, and you had previously talked about getting towards normalized card losses, I think you'd said by around the end of the year. So can you just given the changes that we're seeing ahead of us and definitely saw some normalization happen this quarter, can you just, are you still on line for that getting to that 3-3.5% and 5-5.5% in the respective card businesses by around year-end this year?",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Mark Mason,"Yeah, year-end, early next year, yes. We're still kind of on track, on trend for that. Again, I'd expect that they pick up a little bit after that before they start tapering down. But the answer to your question, Ken, is yes. That's still the timeline, fourth quarter, early 2024 reaching those normalized levels.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Ken Usdin,"Okay, cool. And then one more just follow-up. End-of-period deposits down 3%, you mentioned the taxes. Are the taxes, is the tax impact felt across the business? When I look at the deposits page, there are a lot of ins and there are a lot of outs on an end-of-period basis, and just trying to get a sense of like what areas might have been impacted by that tax seasonality and where there was just some of the other pieces that you've already talked through in terms of inflows, outflows, and everything else in between.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Mark Mason,"Yeah, it's a good question. So, again, when you look at our deposits on an average basis, you see on page 26 that they tick up a little bit. If you look at it on an end of period basis, they're down about 3%, and essentially, intra-quarter, particularly in March as I mentioned earlier, we did see a sizable increase in flows. With that said, if you remember in the fourth quarter, we saw a nice run-up in deposits, and then we have the seasonality point that I referenced in my prepared remarks where we have both operational payments from our large TTS clients as well as tax payments with our TTS clients, also with Wealth clients to some extent kind of playing through the end-of-period deposits.

2023,Q1,Mike Mayo,"Hi. Just one clarification on that last answer. You said you had intra-quarter flows. Did you gain more deposits in the month of March, and was that in the US?",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Mark Mason,"Yes, that's what I was talking about, Mike, in terms of those flows. They did come largely in the US in the month of March, call it March 8th through kind of the end of March. They were overshadowed by these normal payments that I referenced, and we did, we still see good activity kind of even as we came through March and into early parts of April.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Jane Fraser,And that was both in the Institutional business that we saw the inflows as well as in PBWM.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Mark Mason,"Yes, in Wealth.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Mike Mayo,"And if you define deposits this way, I mean, if I'm oversimplifying, correct me, but, look, you have 5,000 multinationals you really target for payments, Capital Markets and Banking. Those companies have a lot of deposits, a lot of Services. That's the stickiness and that's where you said 80% of your clients in TTS have been with you for over 15 years. What if the deposits for those 5,000 multinationals, and I know I'm asking you to slice and dice in a little bit different way, but even just a general sense, because the reason I'm asking this is because I think there's a disconnect between showing percent of uninsured deposits as a measure of stickiness, and I don't think that's valid, and you've showed higher deposits even though you have a big percentage of uninsured deposits or maybe that doesn't matter as much as some front pages of newspapers are suggesting, so if you could address that.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Mark Mason,"Yeah, thanks, Mike. Look, I'd tell you to turn to page 26 in the earnings presentation. We've broken down the deposits for each of the businesses that we have, and at the bottom, you see the TTS deposits, and this is where the 5,000 or so large multinational client deposits reside, and you can see the stability, as well as the steady growth in those deposits over time. And to your point, these are largely operational deposits that these clients have with us, and we shouldn't mistake rate sensitivity or betas with stickiness, right, and it's because these deposits tend to be quite sticky with us, as you can see here. Now, they're price-sensitive in the sense that as rates go up, we often have to reprice those. But remember, the relationships we have with these clients are broader than just deposit relationships, and that's what gives us the opportunity to adjust pricing accordingly with our deposits both in the US and outside of the US. And so the other page, in your own time you can look at it is the page prior to that which again speaks to the diversification of the portfolio but it also speaks to the length of time that many of these clients have been with us and have grown with us, and so nearly 80% of our deposits are from clients that have a greater than 15 year relationship with us, and that says a lot. And so anyway, those are the two points I'd make. Hopefully that addresses your question around the stickiness.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Jane Fraser,"Yeah, I often say it takes a root canal to extract us from the operations of our clients just because of exactly what we're talking about here, and that's also we see it even with the mid-market clients that are a growing portion here as well because we're helping them expand internationally, and that stickiness comes through and the LCR of 120% is a very high-quality LCR ratio.",,yes,No,,Yes,lcr,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,Yes,lcr

2024,Q1,Jane Fraser,"Thank you, Jenn, and good morning to everyone. Today I am going to touch on the macroeco quarter. While global economic performance was surprisingly desynchronized last year, the overall story has been consistent of late: one of economic resiliency supported by tight labor markets and the consumer. Growth this year looks poised to slow in many markets. And conditions are generally disinflationary - you are already seeing some central banks in the emerging markets starting to cut rates. In the U.S., a soft landing is viewed as increasingly likely. But we continue to see a tale of two Europes with Germany hurt by the weak demand for goods while southern European countries such as Spain and Greece benefit from stronger demand in services. In Asia, although its property market remains a concern. Amidst all these dynamics, we continue to focus on executing against our strategy and delivering the best of Citi to all our stakeholders. I said 2024 will be a pivotal year for us as we put our business and organizational simplification largely behind us and we focus on two main priorities: the Transformation and the performance of our businesses and the firm. Last month marked the end to the organizational simplification we announced in September. The result is a cleaner, simpler management structure that fully aligns to and facilitates our strategy. We are now more client-centric clear lines of accountability, starting with my management team, fewer layers, increased spans of control, and frankly much less bureaucracy and needless complexity. This will all help us run the company more efficiently, it will enhance our client experience, and improve more roles were ultimately impacted than the 5,000 we discussed in January. We also took a number of other steps to sharpen our business focus and improve returns by right placing strategy; and right sizing the workforce in Wealth. As a result of all these combined steps, which include the simplification, we are eliminating approximately 7,000 positions which will generate $1.5 billion of annualized run-rate expense saves. The combination of these actions and the measures we are taking to eliminate our remaining stranded costs will drive $2 to $2.5 billion in cumulative annualized run-rate saves in the medium term. We are keeping a close eye on the execution of these efforts and overall resourcing to ensure we safeguard our commitment to the Transformation. As you know, given its magnitude and scale, the Transformation is a multi-year effort to address issues that have spanned over two decades. We have made steady progress as we retire multiple legacy platforms, streamline end-to-end processes, and strengthen our risk and control environment. All of which are necessary, not only to meet the expectations of our regulators, but also to serve our clients more effectively. A transformation of this magnitude is never linear. So while we have made good progress in many areas, there are a few where we are intensifying our efforts, such as automating certain regulatory processes and the data related to regulatory reporting. We are committed to getting these right and will look to self-fund the necessary investments to do so. Turning to the quarter, we had a good start to a pivotal year. We reported net income of approximately $3.4 billion, EPS of $1.58 and an RoTCE of 7.6% on over $21 billion of revenues. Our revenues were up over 3% year-over-year, excluding divestitures, which was primarily the billion-dollar gain from the India consumer sale last year. Our expenses were slightly down quarter-over-quarter, excluding the FDIC special assessments. Services continues to perform well and generate very attractive returns. Revenue was up 8% for the quarter as both businesses won new mandates and deepened relationships with existing clients. Fees were up a pleasing 10% for Services year over year, driven by the investments we have made across our product offering, platforms and client experience. In Securities Services, we took share again this quarter. And in TTS, cross-border activity continued to outpace global GDP growth, and commercial card spend remained robust. We look forward to diving deeper into these two businesses at our Investor Presentation on Services in June. impacted Rates and Currencies, that was off a very strong first quarter last year. We saw good client activity in Equities and in Spread Products, where both new issuance and securitization activity were particularly robust. We fully integrated our Financing and Securitization capabilities within our Markets business and we started to see the benefits of having a unified spread product offering for our clients. The rebound in Banking gained speed during the quarter, led by near-record levels of investment grade debt issuance as improved market conditions enabled issuers to pull forward activity. And after a bit of a slow start, ECM picked up in the second half of the quarter, notably in convertibles. Our strong performance in both DCM and ECM drove Investment Banking revenue growth of 35% and overall Banking revenue growth of 49%. While M&A revenues are still low across the street, I was pleased We are cautiously optimistic that we could see a measured reopening of the IPO market in the second quarter in light of improved market valuations. Corporate sentiment is quite positive, especially in the U.S., and our clients around the world have very sound balance sheets. We very much look forward to welcoming Vis Raghavan to Citi to lead our Banking franchise in early June. Like other new top talent who have joined In Wealth, while revenues were down in the quarter, we grew fees and gathered an estimated $22 billion of net new assets over the past 12 months. As you have seen, Andy continues to form his team and is focused on three areas: first, rationalizing the expense base, second, turning on the growth engine by focusing on investment revenues, and third, enhancing our platforms and capabilities to elevate the client experience. Now t , but getting these things right will help us get more than our fair share of the $5 trillion of assets that they need to be in this business in the medium term. USPB had double-digit revenue growth for the sixth straight quarter. We feel good about our position and our resiliency as a prime, lend-centric issuer and are seeing positive momentum across proprietary card and partner card businesses. Healthy spend growth persists in Branded Cards, primarily driven by our more affluent customers. Across both portfolios, increased demand for credit continues to drive strong growth in interest-earning balances. And while they are only a small part of our portfolio, we are keeping an eye on the customers in the lower FICO bands. We also continue to see strong engagement in digital payment offerings such as Citi Pay, a point-of-sale more value from our Retail Branches as well as getting the expense base right to increase returns there. Our balance sheet is strong across the board, an intentional result of our high-quality assets, robust capital and liquidity positions, and rigorous risk management. During the first quarter, we returned $1.5 billion in capital to our common shareholders, including $500 million through share buybacks. Our CET1 ratio ticked up to a preliminary 13.5% and we grew our Tangible Book Value per share to $86.67. We have a great franchise around the world, with great clients who are served by great colleagues. I am simplification behind us, and a good quarter under our belt, we have started this critical year on the right foot. While there will be bumps in the road, no doubt, we will continue to execute with discipline and we are committed to reaching our medium-term targets. o Mark and then we will both be delighted, as always, to take your questions. Thank you.","billion, , revenue, net income, liquidity, million, trillion, cet1",yes,Yes,cet1,No,,No,,No,,No,,Yes,fdic,No,,Yes,cet1 ratio
2024,Q1,Mark Mason,"Thanks, Jane and good morning, everyone. I am going to start with the firmwide financial results, focusing on year-over-year comparisons for the first quarter unless I indicate otherwise, and then spend a little more time on the businesses. On slide 6, we show financial results for the full firm. In the first quarter, we reported net income of approximately $3.4 billion, EPS of $1.58 and an RoTCE of 7.6% on $21.1 billion of revenues. Total revenues were down 2% on a reported basis. Excluding divestiture-related impacts, largely consisting of the $1 billion gain from the sale of the India consumer business in the prior year, revenues were up more than 3%, driven by growth across Banking, USPB and Services, partially offset by declines in Markets and Wealth. Expenses were $14.2 billion, up 7%, on a reported basis. Excluding divestiture-related impacts and the incremental FDIC special assessment, expenses were up 5%. Cost of credit was approximately $2.4 billion, primarily driven by higher Card net credit losses, which were partially offset by ACL releases in Wealth, Banking and Legacy Franchises. At the end of the quarter, we had nearly $22 billion in total reserves with a reserve-to funded loans ratio of approximately 2.8%. On slide 7, we show the expense trend over the past five quarters. We reported expenses of $14.2 billion, which included the incremental FDIC special assessment of roughly $250 million. Also included in this number are $225 million of restructuring charges largely related to the organizational simplification. In total, actions, we expect approximately $1.5 billion of annualized run-rate saves over the medium term related to a headcount reduction of approximately 7,000. In addition to the restructuring, we took approximately $260 million of repositioning costs largely related to our efficiency efforts across the firm, including the reduction of stranded costs associated with the consumer divestitures. The expected savings from these actions will allow us to continue to fund additional investments in the Transformation this year. And relative to the prior year, the remainder of the expense growth was largely driven by inflation and volume-related expenses, partially offset by productivity savings. In the remainder of the year, we expect a more normalized level of repositioning, which is already embedded in our guidance. Therefore, you can expect our quarterly expense trend to go down from here in line with our $53.5-$53.8 billion ex-FDIC expense guidance. On slide 8, we show net interest income, deposits, and loans, sequential variances. In the first quarter, net interest income decreased by $317 million, largely driven by Markets, which resulted in a 4 basis point decrease in net interest margin. Excluding Markets, net interest income was relatively flat. Average loans were up $4 billion, primarily driven by Loans in Spread Products in Markets, as well as Card and Mortgage loans in US Personal Banking, partially offset by declines in Services. And average deposits were up nearly $7 billion, primarily driven by Services, as we continue to grow high-quality operating deposits. On slide 9, we show key consumer and corporate credit metrics. This quarter, we adjusted our FICO distribution to be more aligned with industry reporting practices and now show our FICO mix using a 660 threshold. Across Branded Cards and Retail Services, approximately 85% of our card loans are to consumers with FICO scores of 660 or higher. And we remain well reserved with a reserve-to-funded loan ratio of 8.2% for our total card portfolio. In our Corporate portfolio, the majority of our exposure is investment grade, which is reflected in our low level of non-accrual loans at 0.5% of total corporate loans. As a reminder, our loan loss reserves incorporate a scenario-weighted average unemployment rate of approximately 5%, which includes a downside scenario unemployment rate of close to 7%. As such, we feel very comfortable with the nearly $22 billion of reserves we have in the current environment. highlight the strength of our balance sheet, capital and liquidity.We maintain a very strong $2.4 trillion high-quality balance sheet, which increased 1% sequentially. Despite this increase, we were able to decrease our risk-weighted assets reflecting our continued optimization efforts and focus on capital efficiency. Our balance sheet is a reflection of our risk appetite, strategy and diversified business model. The foundation of our funding is a $1.3 trillion deposit base, which is well diversified across regions, industries, customers and account types. The majority of our deposits, $812 billion, are corporate and span 90 countries. Most of our corporate deposits reside in operating accounts that are crucial to how our clients fund their daily operations around the world. In most cases, we integrated services payments & collections, liquidity management and working capital solutions. All of which greatly increase the stickiness of these deposits. The majority of our remaining deposits, about $423 billion, are well diversified across the Private Bank, Citigold, Retail and Wealth at Work, as well as across regions and products. Now turning to the asset side, over the last several years, we have maintained a strong risk appetite framework and have been very deliberate about how we deploy our deposits and other liabilities into high-quality assets. This starts with our $675 billion loan portfolio which is well diversified across consumer and corporate loans. And the duration of the total portfolio is approximately 1.2 years. About one third of our balance sheet is held in cash and high-quality, short-duration investment securities that contribute to our nearly $1 trillion of available liquidity resources. And for the quarter, we had an LCR of 117%. So to wrap it up, we are active and deliberate in the management of our balance sheet, which is reflected in our high-quality assets and strong capital and liquidity position. On slide 11, we show the sequential CET1 walk to provide more detail on the drivers this quarter. First, we generated $3.1 billion of net income to common shareholders, which added 27 basis points. Second, we returned $1.5 billion in the form of common dividends and share repurchases, which drove a reduction of about 13 basis points. Third, we saw an increase in our disallowed DTA, which resulted in a 10 basis point decrease. And finally, the remaining 6 basis point benefit was largely driven by a reduction in RWA. We ended the quarter with a preliminary 13.5% CET1 capital ratio, approximately 120 basis points, or over $13 billion, above our regulatory capital requirement of 12.3%. That said, our capital requirement does not yet reflect our simplification efforts, the benefits of our Transformation or the full execution of our strategy, all of which we expect to bring down capital requirements over time. So now turning to slide 12. Before I get into the businesses, let me remind you that in the fourth quarter, we implemented a revenue sharing arrangement within Banking, and between Banking, Services and Markets to reflect the benefit the businesses get from our relationship-based lending. The impact of revenue sharing is in In Services, revenues were up 8% this quarter, driven by continued momentum across both TTS and Securities Services. Net interest income increased 6%, driven by higher deposit and trade loan spreads. Non-interest revenue increased 14%, largely driven by continued strength across underlying fee drivers. In TTS, cross-border volumes increased 9%, USD clearing volumes increased 3% and commercial card spend volumes increased 5%, all of which was driven by strong corporate client activity. In Securities Services, our preliminary assets under custody and administration increased 11%, benefiting from higher market valuations, as well as new client onboarding. The growth in both businesses is a direct result of our continued investments in product innovation, the client experience and platform modernization to gain share across all client segments. TTS continues to maintain its number one position with Large Corporate and FI clients and see good momentum in the commercial client segment. And we continue to gain share in Securities Services. Expenses increased 11%, largely driven by continued investments in technology and product innovation. Cost of credit was $64 million as net credit losses remain low. Net income was approximately $1.5 billion. Average loans were up 4%, primarily driven by strong demand for working capital loans in TTS. Average deposits were down 3% as the impact of quantitative tightening more than offset new client acquisitions and deepening with existing clients. However, it is worth noting that we continue to see good operating deposit inflow. And Services continues to deliver a high RoTCE of 24.1% for the quarter. On slide 13, we show the results for Markets for the first quarter. Markets revenues were down 7% as lower Fixed Income revenues more than offset growth in Equities. Fixed Income revenues decreased 10%, driven by Rates and Currencies, which were down 21%, on the back of lower volatility and a strong quarter in the prior year. This was partially offset by strength in Spread Products and Other Fixed Income, which was up 26% driven by an increase in client activity, particularly in asset-backed lending. And we continued to see good underlying momentum in Equities, with revenues up 5%, driven by growth across cash trading and equity derivatives. And we continued to make progress in prime with balances up more than 10%. Expenses increased 7%, largely driven by the absence of a legal reserve release last year. Cost of credit was $200 million, primarily driven by macroeconomic assumptions related to loans in Spread Products that impacted reserves. Net income was approximately $1.4 billion. Average loans increased 8%, primarily driven by asset backed lending in Spread Products due to an improvement in market activity. Average trading assets increased 4% sequentially, largely driven by seasonally stronger activity in the first quarter. Markets delivered an RoTCE of 10.4% for the quarter. On slide 14, we show the results for Banking for the first quarter. Banking revenues increased 49%, driven by growth in Investment banking and Corporate Lending and lower losses on loan hedges. As I previously mentioned, Corporate Lending results include the impact of revenue sharing from Investment Banking, Services and Markets. Investment Banking revenues increased 35%, driven by DCM and ECM as improved market sentiment led to an increase in issuance activity, particularly Investment Grade, which is running at near-record levels. Advisory revenues declined given the low level of announced merger activity last year. However, in the quarter we participated in the pickup in announced M&A across sectors, including those Corporate Lending revenues, excluding mark-to-market on loan hedges, increased 34%, largely driven by higher revenue share. We generated positive operating leverage this quarter as expenses decreased 4%, driven by actions taken to right size the expense base. Cost of credit was a benefit of $129 million, primarily driven by changes in portfolio composition. The NCL rate was 0.3% of average loans, and we ended the quarter with a reserve-to-funded loan ratio of 1.5%. Net income was approximately $536 million. Average loans decreased 6% as we maintained strict discipline around capital efficiency, as we optimize Corporate loan balances. RoTCE was 9.9% for the quarter, reflecting a rebound in activity, reserve releases and continued expense discipline. On slide 15, we show the results for Wealth for the first quarter. Wealth revenues decreased 4%, driven by a 13% decrease in NII from lower deposit spreads and higher mortgage funding costs, partially offset by higher investment fee revenues. omentum in non-interest revenue, which was up 11%, as we benefited from higher investment assets across regions, driven by increased client activity as well as market valuations. Expenses were up 3%, driven by technology investments focused on risk and controls, as well as platform enhancements, partially offset by the initial benefits of expense reductions as we continue to right size the workforce. Cost of credit was a benefit of $170 million, driven by a reserve release of approximately $200 million primarily related to a change in estimate as we enhanced our data related to margin lending collateral. Net income was $150 million. End-of-period client balances increased 6%, driven by higher client investment assets. Average loans were flat, as we continued to optimize capital usage. Average deposits decreased 1%, largely reflecting lower deposits in the Private Bank and Wealth at Work and the continued shift of deposits to higher relationships and the associated deposits from USPB. Client investment assets were up 12%, driven by net new investment asset flows and the benefit of higher market valuations. RoTCE was 4.6% for the quarter. foundational priorities. As Jane mentioned, this will take time but over the medium to longer-term, we view this as a greater- than-20% return business. On slide 16, we show the results for US Personal Banking for the first quarter. US Personal Banking revenues increased 10%, driven by NII growth of 8% and lower partner payments. Branded Cards revenues increased 7%, driven by interest-earning balance growth of 10% as payment rates continue to moderate. And we continue to see healthy growth in spend volumes up 4%, primarily driven by our more affluent customers. Retail Services revenues increased 18%, primarily driven by lower partner payments due to higher net credit losses, as well as interest-earning balance growth of 9%. Retail Banking revenues increased 1%, driven by higher deposit spreads, loan growth and improved mortgage margins. Expenses were roughly flat due to lower compensation costs, including repositioning, offset by higher volume-related expenses. Cost of credit of approximately $2.2 billion increased 34%, largely driven by higher NCLs of $1.9 billion as card loan vintages that were originated over the last few years were delayed in their maturation due to the unprecedented levels of government stimulus during the pandemic and are now maturing. In Branded Cards, the NCL rate came in at 3.65%, in line with our expectations. In Retail Services, the NCL rate of 6.32% was slightly above the high end of our guidance range for the full year and will likely remain above the range in the second quarter, reflecting historical seasonality patterns. However, given the persistent inflation, higher interest rates and continued sales pressure at our partners, we now expect to be closer to the high end of the full year NCL guidance range for Retail Services. This expectation, along with the continued mix shift from transactors to revolvers across both portfolios, led to an ACL build of approximately $340 million. Net income decreased to $347 million. Average deposits decreased 10%, as the transfer of relationships and the associated deposits to our Wealth business more than offset the underlying growth. RoTCE for the quarter was 5.5%. We recognize that this business is facing a number of headwinds from a regulatory perspective and from higher credit costs given where we are in the credit cycle, both of which are putting pressure on returns for the quarter and for the full year 2024. -term view of the business we feel good about our position as a prime, lend-centric issuer. We will continue to take mitigating actions to manage through the headwinds, lap the credit cycle, and drive more value from Retail Banking and Retail Services while improving the overall operating efficiency of the business all of which will ultimately result in a higher returning business over the medium term. On slide 17, we show results for All Other on a managed basis, which includes Corporate Other and Legacy Franchises and excludes divestiture-related items. Revenues decreased 9%, primarily driven by closed exits and wind-downs, as well as higher funding costs, partially offset by higher revenue in Mexico. And expenses increased 18%, primarily driven by the incremental FDIC special assessment and restructuring charges, partially offset by lower expenses from the wind-down and exit markets. Slide 18 shows our full year 2024 outlook and medium-term guidance, both of which remain unchanged. We have accomplished a lot over the past few years and have made substantial progress on simplifying our business and organizational structure. The year is off to a good start as we are laser focused on executing the Transformation and enhancing the business performance. These two priorities will not only enable us to be a more efficient, agile company, but a client-centric one that brings together the best of Citi to drive revenue growth and improve returns. And we are on the path to reach our 11-12% return target over the medium-term. With that, Jane and I will be happy to take your questions.","capital ratio, billion, , revenue, risk-weighted assets, net income, liquidity, million, loan growth, trillion, net interest income, cet1",yes,Yes,"cet1, capital ratio, risk-weighted assets",Yes,lcr,Yes,loan loss reserves,No,,No,,Yes,fdic,No,,Yes,"lcr, net interest margin"
2024,Q1,"Question And Answer
Operator",Our first question will come from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Please go ahead.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q1,Mike Mayo,"Hi. Well, you just finished your seventh month of your org simplification and you said 7,000 positions go away, with $1.5 billion of expense savings. So that's very concrete, but more generally, after 20, 30, 40 years of matrix structure down to five lines of business, you're reporting these differently, you're talking about them differently, but the question that I think a lot of people have is, are you simply reporting these lines of business differently, or are you actually running them differently? Thanks.",billion,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q1,Jane Fraser,"Thank you, Mike, for the question. The simplification that we've just gone through, it is what we said it is. It is the most consequential set of changes, not only to the organization model that we have but how we run the bank. It's aligned the structure with the strategy. It's simplified the bank. It's eliminated needless complexity. It's created greater transparency into the five businesses and their performance as you can see. It's increased accountability. And very simply, it's just easier for our people to focus on our clients, but also getting things done and the execution that we have ahead of us. So maybe if I try and bring this a bit more alive, the first thing we did was we elevated the five businesses and that eliminated the ICG and PBWM layer, and we brought all the elements that the businesses needed to run end-to-end under the direct management of those five business heads, an example being operations. It's enabled transparency, greater accountability, and this end-to-end and total P&L focus, so focus on the bottom line and the returns driving growth, expense discipline, etcetera. We also right-placed businesses to align with the strategy, so Banking all being under one umbrella, the Investment Bank, the Corporate Bank, Commercial Bank, really helping us drive synergies there. Putting F&S and Securitization into Markets, so that we have a unified spread product there, also beginning to see the benefits of that this quarter. So that's an example in the businesses, but I do want to highlight a couple of other areas around this change. So, by eliminating the regional layer and putting in a far slimmer, lighter management structure in place in the geographies, that's enabled us to make sure that our countries are focused on client delivery and legal entity management, and we've eliminated the whole shadow geographic P&L. We've eliminated a large number of committees in the geographies, and this is where a lot of the functional and management roles were streamlined and eliminated through the last seven months. And we also broke the regions into smaller, lighter clusters, and that allows us to much better capture the big changes in trade flows and financial flows, etcetera we're seeing around the world. It's just much nimbler. The third piece, we created the client organization. So that organization makes sure that our core capabilities and disciplines are being applied firm-wide to drive revenue synergies. And then the governance has got a lot easier, it took up a lot of time, and we've given much clearer mandates and we've more than halved the number of committees. That's 200 committees-plus that we've eliminated in the firm, either by consolidating them or eliminating them. The spans and layers, if you exclude me, 98% of the firm now operates within eight layers. That is a much, much faster decision-making, it's much quicker to get execution done. It also means that you can very quickly get close to where the engine room of the firm is. We've got clearer accountabilities. We've eliminated most co-heads. We've reduced matrix reporting. We've got the producer to non-producer ratio improved. So all of this really means, as I've said, a clearer deck, so we can be laser-focused on business performance in those five businesses and the Transformation. It already feels different. Around my table, I'm much closer to the businesses and the clients. It makes it much easier for Mark and I and the rest of the team to run the bank like an operator versus the head of a holding company. You don't have to go through these aggregated layers to get things done. And we're done, as we said we would be at this point, we're wrapping up the final consultation periods. Not an easy few months for the organization. We've had to say goodbye to some very good people. We've put a lot of change through the organization. And now, as we close the chapter on this, we look forward to being back in BAU mode again, continuing to drive improvements and simplification and processes and the like, but now the focus is going to be really getting the full benefit from all the changes we've made in business and organization and moving forward.",revenue,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,

2024,Q1,Glenn Schorr,"Thanks very much. So I think it shows how much you've helped us see the simpler organization.

I think where I, personally, and others still have questions on is on the revenue side and getting to those 4% to 5% medium-term targets. So, could you take us just conceptually where we're going to where you think you'll drive that growth from, from this baseline where we're at now? And if you want, you can totally use my second question in there and tell us what good things you're doing inside the Investment Banking line.",revenue,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q1,Jane Fraser,"You snuck that one in, Glenn. So I'll kick off with some of this, pass it to Mark and then I'll come back to Banking. So look, we are laser-focused on the growth and improving the returns of these businesses to where they should and will be in the medium term, and it's not just the growth story, but let me anchor it in those medium-term return targets. In Services, we want to continue around the mid-20s in RoTCE. Banking should be getting to around 15%. Markets 10% to 13%, so we'd like to see it at the higher end of that range. USPB getting that back to the mid teens and then moving on to the high-teens in the medium term. And then lastly, as Andy and Mark have talked about, getting Wealth to a 15% to 20% return in the medium term, but the goal is to the mid-20s in the longer-term here. And we're confident that our strategy is going to drive the revenue growth of 4% to 5% CAGR in the medium term and that's a combination of maintaining our leadership in certain businesses, gaining share in others. We have good client growth. Look at our win rate, for example, in TTS at over 80%. We've got our Commercial Bank also bringing in new clients in the mid-market and helping them accelerate their growth and success around the world. But, Mark, let me pass it over to you.",revenue,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q1,Mark Mason,"Sure. And good morning, Glenn, and we appreciate the acknowledgment around the expenses. As you know, we've been quite focused on that and working hard to ensure that we deliver on what we say we're going to do there. I'd point on the revenue line, I'd first point to, if you look back, since Investor Day, we've in fact been able to deliver on the guidance that we've given for the medium term, so that 4% to 5% top line growth. And, yes, it was a different rate environment, but that growth that we delivered over the past couple of years has been a mix of both revenue and underlying business strength. As you think about the guidance we talked about for this year, we talked about the NII ex-Markets being down modestly. And so what that means is that the momentum and the growth that we expect is going to come from the non-interest revenue. And I think this quarter is a good example of where and how that's likely to play through, so the revenue top line being up 3-plus percent, but when you look through each of the businesses, and if you look on each of the pages where we disclose the revenue, you can see the underlying NIR growth in the bottom left hand corner of each of those pages, that's coming through as well. So Services up 14% with growth in both TTS, between cross-border, clearing, commercial cards, but also and Securities Services, right, with the growth that we're seeing from continued momentum in assets under custody. We expect that trend to continue with existing clients and new clients as well as how we do more with our commercial market commercial middle market business, excuse me. So NIR growth there. The Investment Banking piece is the other driver of fees. We're seeing that wallet start to rebound. We're part of that rebound. The announced transactions, we're part of those in sectors that we've been investing in. We're bringing in new talent to help us realize and experience that. And even in Wealth, where we're not pleased with the top line performance this quarter of down 4%. When you look through that, we do have good underlying NIR1 growth in the quarter in Wealth and that's up 11% year-over-year and it's in the area that Andy and the team is leaning in on which is investments and not just in one region, but across all the regions. And then finally, the USPB piece which is showing good NIR1 growth as well, so the long and short of it is that the 4% growth that's implied in $80 billion to $81 billion is going to be continued momentum, largely in fees, helping us to deliver for our clients and make continued progress towards that medium-term target.","billion, revenue",yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q1,Jane Fraser,"So let me pick up, I'm sure Jenn Landis will give us the evil eye for sneaking in a second question there, Glenn, but let me pick up on Banking and what's going on there. So we have a very clear strategy that we've been executing over the last couple of years, really to lay the foundation for growth in Banking. North America is our key priority. It's the biggest contributor to the global IB wallet. Tech, healthcare and industrials are likely to constitute over 50% of the fee wallet going forward. So we have better aligned our resources to position the franchise for this. Defending areas of traditional strength in industrials and the like, energy, whilst investing in high-growth sectors such as healthcare and technology with some strong talent. Financial sponsors are sitting on $3 trillion of estimated fire power, which they are incentivized to deploy, so they're likely to be between 20% to 30% of global Investment Banking fees. We've great relationships with this community, we've built that over years and decades. You're going to see us more active in the LevFin space, in the right situations for our key clients, and we'll continue to ensure we're well-positioned and active around this important opportunity. You'll likely see us seeking to remain competitive in the private capital asset class. That's going to be an important source of liquidity for many clients and the middle market will be fertile hunting ground for corporates and private equity and our Investment Bank and Commercial Bank are going to be closely coordinated to harvest the deal flow around the world. And indeed, the new org structure that I was just talking about really enables us to drive a more joined-up, client-centric, strategic coverage across Corporate, Commercial and Investment Banking. So over and above the wallet recovery, Mark and I are going to be very laser-focused on ensuring that we're driving revenue growth from a more holistic focus on the wallet share across flow and episodic activity. Vis Raghavan is the right person to take over at this important moment for our Banking franchise, the momentum that we've been generating with the foundations we've been laying. Now, the intention here from him is to accelerate that. He will focus on increasing our performance intensity, driving productivity and disciplined growth, and he will keep us firmly on the path towards delivering on our commitments, fundamentally improving the operating margin, generating high returns and that all-important fee revenue.","trillion, revenue, liquidity",yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,

2024,Q1,Betsy Graseck,"I guess a couple of questions. Well, so I know we talked through the Institutional Securities business already on moving that expense ratio a little bit. Could we dig in a little bit on the Wealth side, because the expense ratio there is running a little higher, and so, it'd be useful just to understand the pace or speed or timeframe when we should expect to see that start to inflect.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q1,Jane Fraser,"Yes, absolutely. And some of it, just as a reminder, the actions that we've been taking on org simplification and that Andy has also been taking in the Wealth business. We will work through notice periods in the coming weeks. And so, you'll start you'll see the impact coming through in our head count numbers, and in Wealth, in the expense base next quarter. Look, as Mark said in his opening and Andy has been talking about, this should be a sort of up to a 30% pre-tax margin business. Andy is focused on rationalizing the expense base. He's also, as Mark said, turning on the growth engine. He's enhancing our platforms and capabilities to elevate the client experience. The heart of the opportunity for us lies with our existing clients. They are an extraordinary client base, but they're underpenetrated. So, a lot of the operating efficiency is frankly going to be is going to come on the revenue side here. That said, Andy's taken a number of pretty decisive moves this quarter on the expense side. Mark, let me toss it over to you.",revenue,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q1,Mark Mason,"Yes. I mean, look, I think that the quarter expenses that you see of growth of 3% is not yet reflective of the work that Andy has been steadfast at. There is still some investment in there in technology and in the platform that's important. But I think coming out of the first quarter, you'll start to see some of the reduction in expenses that's a by-product of that work. And the work has been across the entire expense base in the Wealth business. So, that includes non-client-facing roles and support staff. It includes looking at the productivity of existing bankers and advisors, and those kind of reductions will start to play out in the subsequent quarters. I do want to point out, as Jane mentioned, this is a growth business for us. And so, you can see on some of the metrics on page 15 in the bottom left, some of those good signs of investment momentum. And I highlight that because as the expenses come down from some of those efficiencies, there will be a need for us to continue to invest and replenish low-performing or low-producing bankers and advisors with resources that actually can generate the revenues we expect and take advantage of the client opportunity that's in front of us. So, long-winded way of saying there's some operating efficiency upside for us for sure. It's a combination of the top line and the expense work playing through the balance of the quarters and the year here.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q1,Operator,Our next question is from Jim Mitchell at Seaport Global. Your line is open. Please go ahead.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q1,Jim Mitchell,"Okay. Good morning. Jane and Mark, I very much appreciate the comments on your growth opportunities and driving growth. But revenues are often dictated by the macro that is a little bit out of your control. So, can you talk a little bit about the flexibility on the expenses? You have a range in 2026 of $51 billion to $53 billion. So, if revenues are coming in below the targets, is it, I guess, A, fair to assume you'd be at the very low-end of that range or is and I think there is some revenue growth built in there. So, is there some flexibility to the downside to try to get to your targets in a tougher revenue environment? Thanks.","billion, revenue",no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q1,Mark Mason,"Yeah. Look, the top line growth, as you've heard us say, is a CAGR of 4% to 5%. We've put that target out there of $51 billion to $53 billion as a range of what we're working towards. We've given you a good sense of how we expect to get there with the $2 billion to $2.5 billion reduction by then. We've already signaled $1.5 billion that's in front of us. The reality is that if there's softness in revenues, that's why we have a range, obviously, the volume-related expenses would come down with any softness in revenue. And depending on the drivers of why that revenue is softening, we'd look at the investments that we're making across the business and make sure that those are appropriately calibrated for where we are in the cycle and what we're seeing on the top line. With that said, we've got to continue to invest in the Transformation. We're not going to compromise that. That's going to be something that we have to spend on to ensure we continue to get right. But that's kind of how the dynamic works. There's a top we've got a mix of businesses that I think we've demonstrated resiliency around if you think about the past couple of years, and we expect for those to continue to drive some top line momentum. But we've got levers in case they don't.","billion, revenue",yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,

2024,Q1,Ebrahim Poonawala,"Thank you. I guess just one question, Mark, around capital. So, you talked about $13 billion over the reg minimum. Like you could easily be doing 2x the buyback you did in one quarter, if not more. I know you don't like to talk about out-quarters, but give us a sense of the case this quarter. Should we expect the pace of buybacks to increase? And if you could provide additional color as we think about the rest of the year would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.",billion,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q1,Mark Mason,"Sure. Look, you know and I've said it repeatedly, Jane has said it repeatedly, given where we trade, we think buying back is smart and we'd like to do as much as we possibly can and as much as makes sense in light of the uncertainty that's out there. We have run at about 13.5% this quarter. That does give us capacity above the 13.3%. But it's important to keep in mind that there's client demand that will continue to evolve. We want to make sure we can support the clients that want to do business with us, whether that be in Markets or other parts of the franchise. And then, there's still uncertainty out there about how the capital regulation evolves. The good news is we are hearing kind of favorable things about how the Basel III Endgame proposal could evolve, but that hasn't happened yet. It's not finalized. It's not in place yet. And so, we want to see how that continues to play out. We're obviously in the midst of a CCAR process. We want to see how that evolves, and we'll continue to take the buyback decision on a quarter-by-quarter basis. But we recognize that there's an opportunity there, and we'll get after it just as soon as it makes good sense for us.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,Yes,ccar,No,,No,,Yes,basel iii,No,
2024,Q1,Operator,Our next question is from Erika Najarian at UBS. Please unmute your line and ask your question.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q1,Erika Najarian,"Hi. Good afternoon. So, clearly, the theme of this that's emerging on the Q&A is a healthy skepticism about the revenue targets in line with the in light of the expense declines, which is not really us analysts, we're sort of a little bit parroting what we're hearing from long-only investors that haven't yet jumped into the stock. So, to that end, I guess I'm going to ask Ebrahim's question differently, and then ask a question about card late fees. How are you balancing clearly, your valuation would demand that the buybacks be ramped up from $500 million. But growing revenues at a 4% to 5% CAGR would mean potentially some capital plowed back into the business. I guess how are you balancing that, especially given that the demand for buyback is louder at Citi than any other money center peer? And could you give us a sense of what card late fees are and how that would impact the $80 billion to $81 billion for the year if we do get an earlier implementation than October?","billion, revenue, million",no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q1,Mark Mason,"Yeah. Thank you, Erika. On the first part of the question, I'd just remind you and everyone else that we're playing for the long-term here, right. So, we have set some medium-term targets. Obviously, Jane has recasted the vision and the strategy. I think we're making very good progress against that, but we're playing for the long-term. And what that means is that we have to continue to invest in the franchise. It's why I've given you a range around the expenses, at least in part. It's why I've continued to stress the importance of protecting the Transformation and risk and control spend. And it's why I started the answer to Ebrahim's question by saying that we want to be sure that we can match the client demand out there, where the returns to do so makes sense. And so, we are having to balance kind of the use of capital and other resources against that longer term strategic objective and utilize it where it makes sense and generates good returns against the idea of returning that to shareholders. And so, we'll continue to do that. It's an everyday assessment. It's an everyday discussion with the teams. Frankly, it's why things like the revenue sharing has been put in place to intensify the discussion around the clients that we're using balance sheet with and ensuring that we're driving broader revenues across the platform. And so, that's kind of how we're operating in terms of making that trade-off on a regular basis, in addition to obviously the broader regulatory environment that we're in. In terms of the second part of your question around late fees, we haven't disclosed kind of the dollar amount of the late fees. What I would say is that we did and have factored that into the $80 billion to $81 billion. And the only thing I'd add to that is it did kind of it's being implemented a bit earlier than what we had assumed. But again, it's inside of the range of the guidance that I've given you for top line revenue for the year.","billion, revenue",yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q1,Jane Fraser,"s a reminder, 85% of our two card portfolios are prime, and in CRS, where you tend to see some of the lower income households, we do have that the economics of the fee change will be shared with our partners in CRS. So, we want our customers to pay on time. We have a number of mechanisms to do so. But in terms of the economics, I think we, along with the rest of the industry, will be putting in mitigating actions over time, some of which we've already begun to implement.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,

2024,Q1,Operator,Our next question is from John McDonald at Autonomous Research. Your line is open. Please go ahead.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q1,John Mcdonald,"Thanks. Mark, I was hoping you'd give a little more color on how you're feeling about the credit card charge-offs. You maintained the outlook for the year. You mentioned the higher end on Retail Services. Do you still feel like you'll see a peak this year? And what kind of metrics are you looking at in terms of delinquency formation and seasoning to inform that view that you might see the peak in card charge-offs this year?",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q1,Mark Mason,"Yeah. Thanks, John. We have obviously continued to manage this portfolio very actively. We've seen continued top line growth. We've seen continued average interest-earning balance growth. We've talked about how we expect for the cost of credit to normalize, and we've seen that continue to happen. The range that we've given on Branded Cards, we're inside of that range. When you look at the spend across the portfolios, the spend is really happening with the affluent customers more so than anything else. And so, we're watching the lower income customer profile or customers that we have. But again, as Jane mentioned, we tend to skew to the higher end to begin with. Where we're really seeing the pressure is where I mentioned in terms of Retail Services. And so, there, the current NCLs are higher than the high-end of the full year range that I've given. But if you look back, that is not inconsistent with seasonality that we've seen in the past in that portfolio, where the first two quarters are higher than the back half of the year, in part because of coming out of the holiday season and how losses tend to mature or materialize through that process. And so, I'd expect to not only see them be higher than the average range in Q1, but also in Q2 before coming down. And then, I still expect that in 2025, you tend to see them further normalize and come down a bit off of these ranges. But look, the reality is that we continue to watch it, and the factors that are out there that are important include how unemployment evolves, what happens with inflation, what happens with interest rates, and those will be important factors as to how the loss rates continue to evolve over time. I think the final point I'd make and I mentioned it in the prepared remarks is that we have to remember that the loss rates in both portfolios reflect kind of multiple vintages maturing at the same time. And you'll recall, and this is an industry dynamic, through the COVID pandemic period, losses were at an all-time low, payment rates at all-time highs, supported by government stimulus. And now coming out of that, we're seeing the COVID vintages mature, albeit at a lagged pace from what would be normal, and we're seeing the incremental acquisitions that we've done start to mature at their normal pace. And so, these loss rates are exacerbated by that impact and that's an important factor we can't lose sight of. But the bottom line is that we're watching it. The macro factors matter. We feel good about the quality mix that we have, and we'll kind of see how things evolve from here.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q1,John Mcdonald,"Okay and on the Branded side, you still expect kind of the peak-ish? Are you still inside of the range for the full year and expect 2025, you could move lower on the Branded charge-offs?",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q1,Mark Mason,"Yes, I still kind of expect that trend line of peaking and then kind of moving a bit lower in Branded.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,

2024,Q1,Ken Usdin,"Great. Thanks. Can I follow up on the card line of thinking and just ask you, Mark, to talk a little bit about just cost of credit? We did still see some card related build this quarter even with the comments you just made and seasonal softer loan growth So, just from a bigger picture perspective, how do you think, continue to think about reserve builds from here and how that informs your outlook for cost of credit?",loan growth,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q1,Mark Mason,"Yeah, sure. Look, I think that when I think about the reserve builds, I think it's the same factors that come into play. So, obviously, the view on the macro is important. And right now, if you think about some of the key macro factors that impact the cards portfolio, the unemployment assumptions weighted is about 5%, the downside is about 7% kind of weighted over the period. And so, how that evolves will be an important factor. How HPI evolves would be an important consideration here for this portfolio, but also what happens with volumes becomes a factor on reserve builds and how important or how much they increase or decrease. And then the final piece is mix, and it's kind of related to that revolver point. As we see the mix evolve from transactors to revolvers, that's going to play into how much of a reserve from a lifetime point of view we have to continue to build. And so, it's why I mentioned on John's question the importance of looking at the interest rates, looking at what's happening with inflation, watching the lower income customer base, because all of those things combined with how we think about the scenarios and the weighting will be a factor on the reserves. But I will say, Ken, as I sit here and think about what we have in the quarter, I feel very good about the reserve levels. The 8.2% for combined kind of ACL-to-loan ratio feels right for the mix of this portfolio and we'll continue to watch it.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q1,Ken Usdin,"Okay. And a separate question on TTS. That NII related to TTS has been remarkable with rising rates. This quarter, granted there was a lesser day and there could be currency stuff in there, the first quarter that it stepped back, I'm just wondering like where is that in its asset liability sensitivity, the TTS NII, and what are your thoughts about that piece of the NII puzzle going forward? Thanks.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q1,Mark Mason,"Sure, yeah. I mean, I think I'd say a couple things. We do have kind of some Argentina playing through the NII line. I will say that the best way to think about it is kind of the underlying beta activity. And we have seen, this is the corporate client, it is an institutional client. We have seen betas, particularly in the US, at kind of normalized or terminal levels and playing a bit through that. We are seeing betas outside of the US continue to increase as it relates to the TTS client base. But all of that again is inside of the range that we've talked about. I don't expect to see kind of year-over-year growth on the NII line anywhere close to kind of what we've seen in prior years, prior quarters, just in light of kind of how the rate environment s evolved, and in light of kind of quantitative tightening and the impact on deposit levels. The last point I'd make on this is, we will continue to drive and see growth as it relates to the operating deposits, and that will be an important tailwind that kind of plays through.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,

2024,Q1,Vivek Juneja,"Hi. Thank you. Jane, Mark, just a question maybe on Argentina, you've shown $100 million in NII. Total net income benefit of $500 million after-tax, so probably implying about $500 million, $600 million of non-interest income benefit. Which line item sorry, which segment did that come through, and is that sustainable?","net income, million",no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q1,Mark Mason,"Yeah, look, there's a mix obviously of things that are driving that net income, including a tax impact on the heels of last year Argentina devaluation activity that's in that line. But the short answer is that if you think about the nature of the business that we do in Argentina, it is a big part of our institutional client relationships. And the primary activities include some of the TTS-type of activities that we've talked about, so liquidity management, payments, custody within the Services business. And so, you'd see a good portion of the activity in Argentina playing through the Services business, some of it in Markets as well, but again, the majority of the activity in Services.","net income, liquidity",yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q1,Operator,Our next question is from Scott Siefers at Piper Sandler. Your line is open. Please go ahead.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q1,Scott Siefers,"Hey, everyone. Thanks for taking the question. Mark, I think you touched on at least a component of this a couple questions ago, but maybe just broadly an update on your rate positioning. I guess I only ask, because it looks like we might be starting to diverge in terms of global rate trajectories, if we potentially go lower in Europe, but higher here for a while. In the aggregate, do these kind of complicate your management or make you feel better or worse about the overall NII momentum for the company?",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q1,Mark Mason,"Yeah, let me try and take it in, in two pieces, I guess. So one is, if I think about how the rate implieds have evolved from the 3 to 6 to now something a little bit north of 1 in the context of what I expect for our performance, it doesn't have a material impact on the guidance that I've given of $80 billion to $81 billion. And in part, that's because as I think about the timing for the planned cuts, which was generally back-loaded, as well as some of the other factors that play through. So, you know, Argentina just announced a policy rate reduction yesterday or a couple of days ago. If rates are a bit higher for longer, we'll watch how the betas continue to evolve. I mentioned earlier, the late fees for the cards business happened a bit sooner. Late fees are actually booked in our NII line. And so, those factors put me in a place where I feel like there will certainly be puts and takes around how that rate curve evolves, and therefore I'm very comfortable kind of leaving the guidance where it is. To answer your broader question, in terms of kind of how we are positioned, I'd point you to the 10-K that we have that's out. And in that 10-K, we offer as we have before a number of IRE scenarios for plus or minus 100 basis points and what it means for our business. And if you look at it, you'll see that for the aggregate firm, for Citi, US dollar and non-US dollar, that we're asset-sensitive. So, as rates increase, we should see an increase in our NII performance. But if you look at the breakdown and that's about I think it was about $1.4 billion or something in terms of the impact of that move. But if you look at the breakdown, what the breakdown will show is that for US dollar, at this point we're neutral. So, if rates were to go up, rates were to go down, no material impact as it relates to our revenue. For the non-US dollar, we're still quite asset-sensitive, right? And so, that should give you some sense for and we recognize the limitations with IRE, it assumes 100 basis point parallel shift across the curve to a static balance sheet, etcetera, but that should give you some sense for the implications of the rate curve moves as it relates to our book of business.","billion, revenue",yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,

2024,Q1,Gerard Cassidy,"Hi, Mark. Hi, Jane. Mark, can you share with us, there's been obviously a lot of conversation around the credit card charge-offs and the credit quality there. If we could shift over to the corporate side, which obviously is very strong, we have seen spreads narrow in the markets on high-yield corporate debt, leverage debt, etcetera. It's very robust out there, but around the global geopolitical risk, do you think the spreads would be widening? Can you guys share with us what you're seeing on the corporate side in terms of competition? Are underwriting standards getting a little bit weaker now as people are trying to grow their books, what are you seeing on that front?",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q1,Mark Mason,"So, look, we're still seeing good demand for corporate credit. And what I'd say is that we've been very disciplined about where we want to play on the risk profile here. We've been very disciplined in terms of the investment-grade large multinationals that we serve. And that hasn't shifted from an underwriting point of view. We have seen spaces like private credit pick up quite a bit, and that I think will continue to evolve. I think importantly, as we think about our Corporate Lending activity, you'll note that actually we've been very disciplined about how we want to deploy balance sheet. And part of that again is a by-product of the revenue sharing that we've implemented, where there's been healthy debate and discussion around the names that we want to continue to serve, and whether they're positioned to take advantage of the broader platform that we have. And so, I think the space will continue to evolve. I think there's been good, healthy demand, despite continued strong balance sheets and part of that demand has been because of where rates are likely to go and continue to evolve. And I think we're well-positioned to be thoughtful about that, but Jane, you may want to add a couple points to it.",revenue,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q1,Jane Fraser,"Yeah, look, around the world, the corporate client base and our Commercial Banking mid market client base have very healthy balance sheets and we're also seeing market access gradually opening up as well, which is also helpful for to the quality issuers across all asset classes. We're seeing both the issuers taking advantage as well as the investors. The deals are well over-subscribed. So, that's also been beneficial as corporates think about their financing needs. The other piece I just pop out there as well is the recent large M&A announcements in multiple industries is a sign of rising confidence from CEOs and boards and active discussions are increasing, as supportive capital markets create confidence, as people think about larger strategic transactions. This is going to feed acquisition finance, bridge financing and some of the higher-margin capital markets and lending activity as well. So, as we look forward, I think it's recognizing the shift in some of the drivers from company just investing, refinancing, looking at where they can diversify their capital raising in different quarters. But I'd just close by saying I couldn't agree with you more about geopolitical risks and fragility. I think the market's too benign in its risk pricing on some of these factors.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q1,Operator,"Our next question is from Matt O'Connor at Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Please go ahead. : Hi. In your prepared remarks, you talked about intensifying certain efforts regarding regulatory processes and data on slide 4 here and was just wondering if you could elaborate on I guess what you're doing or trying to do differently on that front and if there's any meaningful financial impact. Thank you.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q1,Jane Fraser,"Yeah, look. I think, Matt, as we've talked about many times, the Transformation is our top priority, it will be for the next few years. It is foundational for our future success, both in terms of delivering the strategy and the medium-term financial path and we've been making significant investments behind it, as well as not only on the consent order, but also making sure we've got this modern efficient infrastructure. And we're currently deep into a very large body of work, upgrading our data architecture, automating manual controls and processes, consolidating fragmented tech platforms, and all of these help enhance our business performance more broadly, not just the risk and control in the medium term. And as I've said though, there are a few areas where we are intensifying our efforts, such as the automation of certain regulatory processes and data remediation, particularly related to regulatory reporting. We're committed to getting these right. The org changes will help us with execution and making sure that we have the impetus and everything that we need behind it, the investments that we need. We keep a close eye on execution, making sure we've got the right level of resourcing and expertise and we'll invest what we need to do to make sure that we address these different concerns. I can't go into much more detail in terms of CSI obviously, but something of this magnitude you'd expect us to have some areas where we have good progress and others where we need to intensify efforts.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q1,Mark Mason,"Yeah, I mean I think that's exactly right, but you'd also expect that in this type of environment, and on the heels of the regional bank stress last year that we're looking at stress scenarios, we're enhancing our CCAR processes, we're enhancing our resolution to recovery processes. All of those things just to kind of make sure that we're shoring up capabilities and you'd expect that across the industry quite frankly.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,Yes,ccar,No,,No,,No,,No,

2024,Q1,Saul Martinez,"Hi. Good afternoon. I'll change tacks a little bit here, but I'm curious if there's any update on the Mexican IPO and more specifically, I'm kind of curious how set in stone the IPO process is. You will have a new administration and even if it's a candidate from the same party, she may have a less confrontational view of the private sector, perhaps be more allowing of a local bank to extract value from buying a bank. I guess if the facts on the ground were to change, would you be open to a sale potentially being back on the table, because it does seem like this is a situation where a private market valuation could be higher and even materially higher than the public market valuation.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q1,Jane Fraser,"The guiding principle that we have and we've had all along is making sure that we make a decision here that is in the best interest of our shareholders and makes the most sense for them. We are we never say never, but we are very focused on the IPO path here. We believe it is the right one for our shareholders. We're well on track in the path in Mexico. We're very pleased to bring Ignacio Deschamps in as the Banamex Chairman to help guide the IPO process. We announced the management teams for the two banks earlier this quarter. We're far down the path of the technological separation of both banks, and then the full legal separation in the second half of the year. Obviously, the election Is coming up fairly shortly, but we're not anticipating that we would be deviating from the IPO path. That is the path that we are on at the moment. I'll never say never but we do believe that this is the right one, but we'll keep an eye on what's happening in Mexico as we always do.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,

2024,Q1,Chris Kotowski,"Good afternoon, thanks. Just a quick one for Mark. Previously, you had talked about ""bending the cost curve"" between the third and the fourth quarter of this year, and on this call I thought I heard you say it's basically bent, that second quarter should be down and we should be sequentially lower from here, so did it just happen six months earlier or is there still some other bending that comes late this year?",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,

2024,Q1,Steven Chubak,"Hey, Jane. Hey, Mark. Did want to ask on DFAST and SCB just recognizing this will be the last opportunity before the results come out. The macro scenario, Fed assumptions look quite similar to last year but just given the significant transformation that's underway, repositioning actions, which admittedly depressed earnings last year, want to get a sense as to whether there are any idio-factors that could result in greater SCB volatility in the coming exam and just broader thoughts on longer-term trajectory for the SCB, just given the org simplification efforts that are underway.",,no,No,,No,,No,,Yes,dfast,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q1,Mark Mason,"Yeah, Steven the first part of your question is just impossible to answer to be candid with you, right. I mean it's we obviously have an internal based scenario we've run. We have a severely adverse scenario that we've run. We've provided a balance sheet as part of the submission, but ultimately, the regulators have to run through their models, the information that we've provided and that informs what happens with the stress capital buffer, and we don't have as much transparency to that as we'd like and so really hard to call at this stage. The second part of your question I think is spot-on and I kind of alluded to in my prepared remarks in that we have the medium-term targets that we've set and we're still in the midst of kind of the execution of our strategy, the evolution of the business mix and the business model. The mix towards more consistent, predictable and repeatable revenue streams that would impact PPNR, the simplification which obviously plays through an expense base that'll be lower when we get to that medium-term period. So all of those things, the divestitures and kind of what that means and how that might impact the G-SIB score and the like and the freeing up of capital which we've already freed up $6 billion or so, and so all of those things have kind of yet to have been factored in and we believe will be beneficial to the SCB over the medium-term.","billion, revenue",yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,

2024,Q1,Mark Mason,"We have seen growth in the quarter, in operating deposits. The confidence comes from the focus that we've had with our existing clients as well as the growth we've seen with new clients, doing more with existing in more countries, more deeply penetrating the commercial middle-market space, and so we've been very thoughtfully focused on deposits that obviously give us the most value and also, provide the most stickiness as it relates to that relationship and so yes, the confidence is rooted in what we're seeing in the way of underlying operating deposit growth including inside this quarter.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q1,Jane Fraser,"It's also a lot of the investments that we've been making, fuel a lot of the growth we've got. We have a market- leading product innovations and those continue to drive good returns, good growth. If it's Citi Token Services, Citi Payment Express, 24/7 Clearing, all of these different elements really mean that this business is utterly invaluable and indispensable to our clients and the stickiness of the deposits, the operating deposits comes with that, so we feel good about that growth. And you'll hear more about this as well, Mike, in the Investor Day in mid-June which will be I think we hope will be very helpful to everyone so you really get your arms around how this business operates, makes money, and see why we call it a crown jewel.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,

2024,Q1,Vivek Juneja,"Hi. Mark, completely different topic, because I think I understood your answer to be just from my previous question to be the tax benefits so we'll leave it at that. If it's different then I need to go down that path, but the question I signed on to ask was, you talked about the percentage of revolvers increasing from transactors in the private-label and the retail partner cards. What is that percentage and how does it compare with what it was pre-pandemic?",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q1,Mark Mason,"Yeah, I don't we haven't broken down the transactor versus revolver mix, and so I'm not going to get into that. I will say that the revolver levels are at least back to where they were pre-pandemic and leave it at that, but we are seeing kind of continued revolver activity which you'd expect kind of given the way the cycle has evolved and given payment rates have started to moderate and the stimulus has kind of unwound, and so all of that is kind of consistent with expectations but obviously, is a factor in reserve levels as I mentioned earlier.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,

2024,Q1,Betsy Graseck,"Oh, hi, thanks so much. I just wanted to make sure of one thing on the expenses. I know in the past you've talked about the fact that 1Q will be a little elevated with the restructuring. And you showed that was the $225 million in the quarter, and then when we look to 2Q, we should should we still be expecting a step-down in 2Q? And is that step-down just the elimination of the $225 million or is there some restructuring that we're likely to see in 2Q as well? In other words, should I just fade sequentially 2Q, 3Q, 4Q to hit your annual number or is there a bigger step-down in 2Q that I should still be expecting here? Thanks.",million,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q1,Mark Mason,"Sure. I think you should just fade it, to answer your question very directly, but I'd also point out that in Q1, if you really look through to it, it has the $250 million of FDIC charge in it, and so when you back that out, we effectively are coming in lower than what we had guided right. Despite that I'm telling you the same I'm making the same point, which is you can expect a downward trend from here through to the end of the year and while there won't be additional restructuring charge, there will be the normal BAU activity around repositioning that plays through, so hopefully that answers your question, Betsy. The guidance still holds, and the downward trend is what we are managing towards, as we kind of play out the balance of the year.",million,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,Yes,fdic,No,,No,

2025,Q1,Jane Fraser,"Thank you, Jenn, and a very good morning to everyone. First, I am going to discuss our first quarter results and then talk about the environment we are operating in and how we are positioning the bank for it. This morning, we reported net income of $4.1 billion and earnings per share of $1.96 with an RoTCE of 9.1%. Overall, it was a strong quarter, marked by continued momentum in each of our five businesses. We maintained a disciplined approach to our expenses, which declined by 5% year-over-year. We delivered our third consecutive quarter of positive operating leverage for each of our five lines of business and the fourth consecutive quarter for the firm overall. We increased both our return on tangible common equity in each business and our return of capital to our shareholders. This quarter is a further proof point of how the consistent execution of our strategy is improving our performance. Services recorded its highest first quarter revenue in a decade. TTS continues to demonstrate momentum in the key underlying drivers across U.S. dollar clearing and cross-border activity. Securities Services gained share and grew its Assets Under Custody and Administration to $26 trillion. Markets had a good quarter with revenue up 12%. The three most significant Fixed Income businesses – Rates, Spread Products and FX – each contributed to an overall 8% increase over last year. And in a good macro quarter for Equities, we were up 23% as we continued with our long-term strategy to augment our high derivatives share with a larger prime business. Banking was up 12%, as we continue to gain share in Investment Banking across most industry sectors. Most notably M&A revenue nearly doubled. We are seeing the benefits of our talent investments – as you can see by the leading role we played in some of the year’s biggest transactions such as advising Altair on the Siemens acquisition and on the recently announced Intra-Cellular transaction by J&J. Turning to Wealth, all three businesses contributed to overall growth of 24% and fee revenue drove non interest revenue growth of 16%. We remain focused on capturing assets our clients have “off” us as demonstrated by the roughly 11% organic growth in client investment assets. Andy and his new team are making excellent progress executing our strategy, with the business delivering record revenue this quarter and improved efficiency and returns. USPB was up 2%, driven mainly by increased loan balances and spending in Branded Cards. The high credit quality of our cards portfolio reflects the focus we have put on prime consumers and our portfolio continued to perform in line with our expectations. Overall, USPB’s return increased to nearly 13%. During the quarter, we returned $2.8 billion in capital to our shareholders including $1.75 billion of buybacks as part of our $20 billion plan, which is about $250 million more than we had originally guided. That’s our highest quarterly amount since 2022 and demonstrates our commitment to returning capital. We ended the quarter with a CET1 ratio of 13.4% and our tangible book value per share crossed $90. Turning to our strategic priorities, our transformation investments continue to modernize our infrastructure, simplify our processes, and reduce manual touchpoints. During the quarter, we retired legacy applications and automated reconciliations to name but a few accomplishments. We are also integrating AI directly into our business operations to improve the client experience. The latest example is “Agent Assist,” our first generative AI tool for customer service in U.S. Personal Banking. It is designed to help our team resolve inquiries faster and it is now being piloted in credit cards. From quarter to quarter, we are building on our track record of progress, and I am confident in our ability to continue delivering despite the uncertainty of the moment. In terms of the macro environment, I am not going to try to predict the unpredictable. While our corporate and consumer clients are resilient and in good financial health, the world is in a wait-and-see mode and is facing a more negative macro-outlook than anyone had anticipated at the beginning of the year. And we know that prolonged uncertainty generally hurts confidence. The changes underway globally will go beyond trade and tariffs. In the U.S. for example, regulation and tax policy are all likely to look different in a year’s time. These changes will not only have economic impacts but geopolitical and cultural ones as well. We appreciate the Administration taking a fresh look at regulations across all industries to unlock growth. We welcome the changes being discussed in our own industry to place more focus on material financial risks and to make it easier for banks to contribute to economic growth and to improve client service. When all is said and done, and these long-standing trade imbalances and other structural shifts are behind us, the U.S. will still be the world’s leading economy, and the dollar will remain the reserve currency. The deep knowledge and breadth of capabilities that we have from decades on the ground in so many local markets are real points of distinction when serving our clients, from reconfiguring their supply chains, to addressing their hedging and funding approaches, to advising on their strategic agendas. I am very confident that we have built a strategy based on a diversified business mix that will perform in a wide variety of macro scenarios and is differentiating in times like these. With capital strength, plentiful liquidity and strong reserves, we can navigate through any environment from a position of strength. In periods of stress, we have shown that we are a port during the storm for our clients, the global markets, and the economy, and this time is no different. We are ready to lean in. As I look forward to the rest of the year, we shall remain disciplined about returning capital and managing our expenses whilst protecting necessary investments in our businesses as well as our transformation. And we shall not allow the uncertainty to distract us from executing our strategy and improving our returns. Now, over to Mark and then we would be happy to take your questions.","billion, , revenue, net income, liquidity, million, trillion, cet1",yes,Yes,cet1,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,Yes,cet1 ratio
2025,Q1,Mark Mason,"Thanks, Jane and good morning, everyone. I am going to start with the firmwide financial results, focusing on year-over-year comparisons unless I indicate otherwise, and then review the performance of our businesses in greater detail. On slide 6, we show financial results for the full firm. This quarter we reported net income of $4.1 billion, EPS of $1.96 and an RoTCE of 9.1% on $21.6 billion of revenues, generating positive operating leverage for the firm and in each of our five businesses. Total revenues were up 3%, driven by growth in each of our businesses largely offset by a decline in All Other. Net interest income excluding Markets was up 2%, driven by USPB, Wealth and Services, largely offset by declines in All Other and Banking. Non-interest revenues excluding Markets were down 6%, as better results in Banking and Wealth were more than offset by declines in All Other, USPB and Services. And total Markets revenues were up 12%. Expenses of $13.4 billion, were down 5%. Cost of credit was $2.7 billion, primarily consisting of net credit losses in Cards as well as a firmwide net ACL build, reflecting the uncertainty and deterioration in the macroeconomic outlook. Before I move on, I would like to note that certain card transaction processing fees paid primarily to networks were previously presented in operating expenses and are now presented as a contra-revenue in non-interest revenue, primarily impacting USPB. This change does not impact net income, and prior periods have been aligned. We’ve provided additional detail in the appendix of the presentation on slide 22. On slide 7, we show the expense trend over the past five quarters. As we’ve said in the past, we are very focused on bringing down our expense base. At the same time, the transformation remains our #1 priority, and we will continue to make the investments needed, specifically as it relates to data and regulatory reporting. Having said that, the drivers of our expense reduction going forward remain consistent with those that we have referenced in the past. Savings related to stranded cost reduction, productivity from our prior investments and our organizational simplification, all of which allow us to self-fund our investments in transformation. As we look at this quarter, expenses declined by 5%, which included a favorable FX impact. The decline was driven by a smaller FDIC special assessment, absence of a restructuring charge and lower compensation. Partially offset by increases in technology and communications, professional fees related to transformation, as well as advertising and marketing. And looking at the rest of the year, we remain on track to meet our full year expense target. On slide 8, we show key consumer and corporate credit metrics. As I mentioned, the firm’s cost of credit was $2.7 billion, primarily consisting of net credit losses in cards as well as a firmwide net ACL build. The ACL build reflects uncertainty and deterioration in the macroeconomic outlook, including a further skew to the downside scenario in our CECL framework. Our reserves now incorporate an eight-quarter weighted average unemployment rate of 5.1%, which includes a downside scenario average unemployment rate of 6.7%. Largely offsetting this build was a release related to lower balances in our card portfolios. At the end of the quarter, we had $22.8 billion in total reserves with a reserve-to-funded loans ratio of 2.7%. Now turning to consumer credit on the left-hand side of the page, approximately 85% of our card portfolios are to consumers with FICO scores of 660 or higher. NCL rates increased sequentially in both card portfolios, consistent with historical seasonal patterns, and we continue to see stabilization in delinquency rates across both portfolios. And our reserve to funded loan ratio in our card portfolio is 8.2%. And corporate non-accrual loans remain low, reflecting the investment grade nature of our portfolio. Based on the quality and mix of our portfolio we believe we are well-reserved, but as always, we continue to monitor the evolving macroeconomic outlook. Turning to slide 9, where I will speak to sequential variances. Citi’s $2.6 trillion balance sheet increased 9% driven by growth in trading-related assets, which is typical given the seasonal increase in Markets activity. We also built our cash position as we let investment securities roll off and opportunistically issued long-term debt. Loans increased 1%, driven by Services and Markets, largely offset by lower balances in cards. Our $1.3 trillion deposit base remains well-diversified across regions, industries, customers and account types, and increased 2%, primarily driven by Services. We reported 117% average LCR and maintained $960 billion of available liquidity resources. We ended the quarter with a preliminary 13.4% CET1 Capital ratio, down approximately 20 basis points, as net income was more than offset by capital distributions, RWA growth and higher DTA deductions. We continue to feel very good about the strength and quality of our balance sheet, and our robust capital and liquidity position us well to support our clients in a range of economic environments. Turning to the businesses on slide 10, we show the results for Services in the first quarter. Services revenues were up 3%, driven by growth in TTS. NII increased 5%, driven by higher deposit spreads as well as an increase in deposit and loan balances. NIR declined 4%, driven by the absence of certain episodic fees in Securities Services as well as higher revenue share and the impact of FX across both TTS and Securities Services. That said, we continue to see strength in underlying fee drivers across the business, as you can see on the bottom right-hand side of the page. Expenses declined 3%, largely driven by lower deposit insurance costs, severance and legal expenses. Average loans increased 6%, driven by continued demand for export agency finance as well as working capital loans. Average deposits increased 2% as we continue to see growth in operating deposits. Services generated positive operating leverage for the third consecutive quarter and delivered net income of $1.6 billion, and continued to deliver a high RoTCE of 26.2%. On slide 11, we show the results for Markets in the first quarter. Markets revenues were up 12%, driven by growth across both Fixed Income and Equities. Fixed Income revenues increased 8%, with Rates and Currencies up 9%, reflecting increased client activity and monetization. And Spread Products and Other Fixed Income, up 7%, driven by higher client activity and loan growth. Equities revenues increased 23%, primarily driven by Equity Derivatives, on increased market volatility and higher client activity, and momentum in Prime Services, with Prime balances up approximately 16%. Expenses increased 2%, driven by higher volume and other revenue-related expenses. Cost of credit was $201 million, primarily related to Spread Products, driven by net credit losses and a net ACL build. Average loans increased 7%, driven by financing activity in Spread Products. Markets generated positive operating leverage for the fourth consecutive quarter and delivered net income of $1.8 billion and an RoTCE of 14.3%. On slide 12, we show the results for Banking in the first quarter. Banking revenues were up 12%, driven by growth in Investment Banking as well as the impact of mark-to-market on loan hedges, partially offset by a decline in Corporate Lending. Investment Banking fees increased 14%, with growth in M&A partially offset by declines in DCM and ECM. M&A was up 84%, as we gained share overall and across numerous sectors. DCM was down 3% compared to a near-record first quarter last year. And ECM was down 26%, amid a pullback in the wallet for follow-ons and convertibles. Corporate Lending revenues, excluding mark-to market on loan hedges, declined 1%, as increases in revenue share were more than offset by the combined impact of lower loan balances and higher recoveries in the prior year. Expenses declined 12%, largely driven by lower compensation, as we see the benefits of our prior actions to right-size the workforce and expense base. Cost of credit was $214 million, consisting of an ACL build of $180 million, driven by changes in the macroeconomic outlook, and net credit losses. Banking generated positive operating leverage for the fifth consecutive quarter, and delivered net income of $543 million and an RoTCE of 10.7%. On slide 13, we show the results for Wealth in the first quarter. Wealth revenues were up 24%, with growth across Citigold, the Private Bank and Wealth at Work. NII increased 30%, driven by higher deposit spreads partially offset by lower deposit balances. And NIR increased 16%, primarily driven by growth in investment fee revenues, as we grew client investment assets by 16%. This includes net new investment assets of $16.5 billion in the quarter and over $56 billion in the last 12 months, representing approximately 11% organic growth. Expenses were roughly flat, as the benefits of our prior actions to right-size the workforce and expense base as well as lower technology expenses were offset by higher revenue-related expenses and severance. End-of-period client balances increased 7%, driven by higher net new investment asset flows and market valuations. Average loans declined 2%, as we continue to be strategic in deploying the balance sheet to support growth in client investment assets. Average deposits also declined 2%, driven by a shift in deposits to higher-yielding investments on Citi’s platform and other operating outflows, largely offset by client transfers from USPB, reflecting our ability to support clients as their wealth and investment needs evolve. Wealth had a pre-tax margin of 17% and generated positive operating leverage for the fourth consecutive quarter, and delivered net income of $284 million and an RoTCE of 9.4%. On slide 14, we show the results for U.S. Personal Banking in the first quarter. U.S. Personal Banking revenues were up 2%, driven by growth in Branded Cards and Retail Banking, largely offset by a decline in Retail Services. Branded Cards revenues increased 9%, with interest-earning balance growth of 8% and we continue to see spend growth, which was up 3%. Retail Banking revenues increased 17%, driven by the impact of higher deposit spreads. And in Retail Services revenues declined 11%, primarily driven by higher partner payment accruals. Expenses were roughly flat, due to continued productivity savings offset by higher advertising and marketing as well as legal expenses. Cost of credit was $1.8 billion, consisting of net credit losses, partially offset by a net ACL release of $172 million. This included a build related to changes in the portfolio composition and macroeconomic outlook, which was more than offset by a release due to lower card balances, largely in Retail Services. Notwithstanding this release, our cards reserve to funded loan ratio increased to 8.2% from 7.9% last quarter. Average deposits declined 11%, driven by client transfers to Wealth that I just mentioned. USPB generated positive operating leverage for the tenth consecutive quarter and delivered net income of $745 million and an RoTCE of 12.9%. On slide 15, we show results for All Other on a managed basis, which includes Corporate/Other and Legacy Franchises and excludes divestiture-related items. Revenues declined 39%, with declines across both Corporate/Other and Legacy Franchises. Corporate/Other was largely driven by lower NII as well as the impact of mark-to-market valuation changes on certain investments on NIR. Legacy Franchises was driven by the impact of Mexican peso depreciation, expiration of TSAs in our closed exit markets and continued reduction from our wind-down markets. Expenses declined 17%, driven by a smaller FDIC special assessment, absence of a restructuring charge, reduction from exit markets and wind-downs and the impact of Mexican peso depreciation. And cost of credit was $359 million, largely driven by net credit losses of $256 million, driven by consumer loans in Mexico. On slide 16, I’ll briefly touch on our full year 2025 outlook, which we’ve adjusted for the impact of the card transaction processing fee presentation change that I mentioned earlier, but is otherwise unchanged. As you know, in January, we provided guidance for full year revenue and expenses as well as card NCLs – and that guidance was informed by a number of scenarios and assumptions. Based on what we know today, and assuming markets remain open and constructive, we still expect to deliver full year revenues of approximately $83.1 to $84.1 billion, with net interest income excluding Markets up approximately 2% to 3%. And we expect full year expenses to be slightly lower than $53.4 billion. Clearly there remains a lot of uncertainty, but we are confident that our diversified business model and resilient strategy can withstand many environments, and we remain well-positioned to support our clients. So, while a lot is changing around us, we remain steadfast and focused on continuing to execute on our transformation and strategy while remaining disciplined with our expenses and capital with an eye towards improving returns over time. And with that. Jane and I would be happy to take your questions.","capital ratio, billion, , revenue, net income, liquidity, million, loan growth, trillion, net interest income, cet1",yes,Yes,"cet1, capital ratio",Yes,lcr,No,,No,,No,,Yes,fdic,No,,Yes,lcr
2025,Q1,Operator,Our first question will come from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2025,Q1,Glenn Schorr,"Hi, thanks very much. So, I know it's early, but I'm curious if you could help us with a refresher on Treasury and Trade Solutions and Services in general. In terms of what opportunities there's risk, but also opportunities in helping clients manage through this re-tariffing and redrawing of economic lines. I think about nationalization and vertical integration as bad things, but a lot of shifting, and maybe you can help clients deal with all that shifting. But anything any help there would be great.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2025,Q1,Jane Fraser,"Glenn, I would be delighted to do so. So, our diversified business mix is very well positioned for a variety of scenarios. We think we've got a very broad suite of products and services. And they are the ones that clients need if they're going to be repositioning for a new order in trade or broader impacts here. And think about what you've seen over the last few years where we played a very central role: the Ukraine Russia war, China, the COVID-related supply chains. We saw a lot of growth from deepening with clients and acquiring new ones because they need us, because we have exactly the expertise and the products and services that multinational institutions need, and we have them in the places that they need it. Now,the mix of those different revenues, different products and services we have could be different depending on which scenario prevails. And what I have to say at the moment, the level of engagement that we have with our clients all around the world, is just off the charts, given the unique depth of our presence and the insights we have in all the markets. So, if I dig down a bit more, what would the persistence of high tariffs, what would it mean? Well, it would dampen economic activity here in the in the U.S. and abroad. Cross-border trade flows will change, we'll be in the middle of facilitating that. So, we expect to be very busy there along with the hedging and associated financing activity that goes with it because it's not just about TTS. This is about the bundle of different capabilities we bring to bear. And take some comfort, look at what happened with the Ukraine war. We grew a lot in that time period. Equally, most of our business is very local. Think of what Services is, it's payroll, it's supplier management, it's liquidity, it's payables, it's receivables. And we're very deeply embedded into our clients' day-to-day operations in every market they work in as well as across market flows. And that's not going to change. It's not nearly as sensitive to tariffs. And I would say, I think all of us recognize the environment is very fluid right now. So let me also just say for clarity sake, at the firmwide level, our RoTCE targets for 2026 are still 10% to 11%. The drivers behind them are the same, but the revenue mix might be different. We'll certainly know more as things get clearer as to how that plays out. I think actually the other thing you mentioned about nationalization. Most of our clients have been clients for decades. I mean, a number of them have been clients for over a century. And it would not be British understatement to say that we are deeply embedded into them. I mean, it is extraordinary how deep we are. We've been on the ground for over a century, and we are viewed as quasi-local in most of these markets. Citi is not a bunch of suitcase bankers that fly in. We're not transactional. We're very unique in the footprint. And these factors do make us less vulnerable to the different geopolitical dynamics that are going on.","revenue, liquidity",yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2025,Q1,Operator,Our next question comes from the line of come from Jim Mitchell with Seaport Global. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2025,Q1,Jim Mitchell,"Hey good morning. Maybe Jane, just following up on that conversation, and you talked about leaning into, as being a port in the storm and leaning into it. So, I guess in the near term, are you seeing sort of demand already in terms of your balance sheet, whether it's raising liquidity and deposit flow like sort of flight to safety deposit flows and sort of the trading aspect of it from this volatility in April, have you sort of already seen greater demand from clients?",liquidity,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2025,Q1,Jane Fraser,"What I'd say about the clients at the moment, you're seeing deals still happening. We've done a number of them, as we've talked about, even over this last weekend, we were pretty busy, but I would say that most clients are pausing their plans. Now no one is taking bets in the market right now. We're seeing them prep for more headwinds. So, we're seeing some bolstering of already strong balance sheets. Remember, our client base aren't the smaller companies in the mid-market that are going to get more pummeled in this type of environment. So that our clients are getting ready. We're seeing some accelerating of imports to stockpile inventories. We are seeing a pausing on significant CapEx, while everyone waits to get clarity on the full agenda. And in that full agenda, remember, there's tax bill, there's deregulation actions. These are some positives that will be coming. It's a very big agenda. Clients appreciate it's going to take time. In terms of the trading side, what we're seeing is it is pretty orderly out there. There's a lot of complicated dynamics happening, but it's not being catalyzed by liquidity crisis or other things going on. Let's not fight the war, the last war. The issue we're tackling at the moment is something different. And we're seeing clients taking the opportunity to de-risk. We are, others are, so that if we have more turbulence ahead, everyone is in a stronger position for it, and that is a good thing. But it's early days, Jim. We've got to see how this unfolds.",liquidity,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2025,Q1,Jim Mitchell,"Sure. No, I appreciate that color. And then maybe for Mark, I mean, you highlighted at least on a period-end basis, deposit growth and commercial loan growth looked pretty good on a period-end basis quarter-over-quarter. So, I guess when we think about the NII assumptions, deposit and loan growth looks good, but anything different given the strong start to the NII ex-Markets story and seemingly some good momentum in deposit and loan growth. Do you feel good, better, worse on sort of your NII outlook for this year?",loan growth,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2025,Q1,Mark Mason,"Yes. Thanks, Jim. Look, I continue to feel good about the NII outlook. There's obviously uncertainty that Jane has referenced, but that 2% to 3% ex-Markets. We've talked in the past about what the tailwinds and headwinds are. And you referenced, we saw some of that play through in the quarter in terms of deposit volumes. We saw a good operating momentum in our Services business in TTS in particular. The loan growth saw not just in average interest-earning balances on the Branded Cards side, but also saw trade loan growth as well. And so those are going to be important tailwinds as I think about the balance of the quarter. You've heard me reference as well, reinvestment from maturing securities in our investment portfolio into higher-yielding assets, including cash, and you can see that on the balance sheet that some of that started to take place as well in helping deposit spreads. And then the team has been very, very engaged as it relates to deposit repricing and managing beta through the current environment. So, the combination of those things, along with the removal of the reduction of late fees are really tailwinds that contribute to that 2% to 3% growth, and then there's some headwinds. So lower rates on floating rate assets would be a [headwind]. The potential of FX translation, primarily in Mexico would be a [headwind], but net-net, I feel good about the 2% to 3% growth in NII ex-Markets.",loan growth,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2025,Q1,Operator,"Our next question comes from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open, please go ahead.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2025,Q1,Mike Mayo,"Hi, I just wanted to continue the discussion about, on one hand you’re a port in the storm. You've been embedded decades and you're not a bunch of suitcase bankers. So that message has landed. On the other hand, I mean, you are the bank that facilitates global trade in the middle of a global trade war. And so, I think the concern is not just the possibility that that revenues will nosedive, but credit will implode or as I've heard many, many times that Citigroup is going to stub its toe, just 100 countries in the mix of it all. What else can you say in addition to what you said to either reassure investors that the oversight is strong or that you have your arms around the situation, the best that that you can, again, recognizing it's a fluid situation. Thank you.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2025,Q1,Jane Fraser,"So, you've seen us perform extremely well over the last few years in the face of pretty wrenching changes in the global economy. You’ve seen it with say, shifts in supply chains after COVID and then between the geopolitical tensions that are going on, you saw it in pretty significant changes that were happening from the Russia and Ukraine war. And you see us exactly as that, we are where the clients come, it's hedging for foreign exchange, interest rates, commodities, you see it for how they're looking at changing their financing around, and we tend to be the ones that are helping them reconfigure the flows. So, from that point of view, we are the active agent in a lot this mix. And we are a port in the storm as I said, Mike, we've got very strong balance sheet, capital and liquidity to deploy. We have the big strategic changes and organization changes behind us, and they're enabling us to be on the front foot. And this is a firm that is much more agile and able to respond and be much more focused on clients right now. So, I feel good about this.",liquidity,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2025,Q1,Mark Mason,"Yes. The only thing I'd add, I mean, Jane, you're spot on, right. We come in with a strong balance sheet, strong capital, strong liquidity. If you think about your point around credit, Mike, we've said repeatedly, and you can see it in the numbers. We skew towards the higher investment grade, larger multinationals who also come into this with strong balance sheets. We've been very disciplined about that risk framework, our risk appetite, both on the corporate side as well as it relates to our consumers. And then what we tend to see in times of stress is a flight to quality as it relates to deposits. And so again, depending on how this evolves, we're well positioned to manage whatever the needs are of our clients, whether that be lending needs or the storing of liquidity, and we're very well reserved to manage whatever credit risk may come with that despite us being skewed towards higher quality names in both of those demographics.",liquidity,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2025,Q1,Mike Mayo,"Okay. The flip side of this is you did say the drivers are same. They might be different in magnitude to take you from where you are now you had over 9% RoTCE in the quarter. You said you're on track to get to 10% to 11% next year. Can you put a little meat on the bones kind of verbal waterfall chart, if you would, or maybe some numbers around org simplification stranded costs, productivity savings. How do we get from 9% in the first quarter to that magical double-digit return target for next year?",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2025,Q1,Jane Fraser,"And I'd just remind everyone, we're a very different bank than the one we were a few years ago in terms of our business mix, our risk profile and all the investments we've made into the business. And I think you can see us managing the bank doing what we say we'll do and please take some confidence in that.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2025,Q1,Operator,"Our next question will come from the line of Ebrahim Poonawala with Bank of America. Your line is now open, please go ahead.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2025,Q1,Ebrahim Poonawala,"I guess Mark, just wanted to on Slide 9 and the capital waterfall. I guess we are all thinking about what buybacks can do in the second half of this year. So, if you don't mind, one, the RWA sort of drag, the 32 basis points. Is that normal as we think about what the RWA consumption should look like? Just talk about that in the context of getting to a 13.1% CET1 by the end of the year. And how we can back into the pace of buybacks.",cet1,no,Yes,cet1,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2025,Q1,Mark Mason,"Yes. So, I'd say a couple of things. So one, last quarter, we announced a $20 billion share repurchase program. And we continue to feel good about that program, as you would expect. And we increased our buybacks this year, or this quarter, I should say, to the $1.75 billion, seeing the strength of the performance that was playing out through the quarter. And so those are both, I think, indications of our continued commitment to returning capital to the shareholders. We're clear on where we're trading, and we're clear that, that is a smart thing to do once we've funded demand from a client point of view across our businesses, that's accretive to returns. And so, the RWA consumption is tied to that demand that we see. We think we've seen good client demand across the platform that's helped drive the top line momentum that you see in each and every one of our businesses that's helped to drive the improved returns that you see in the quarter in each and every one of our businesses. And as we see that demand, again, accretive in returns, we'll be looking to meet that as a first priority. We are targeting the 13.1% [CET1 Capital ratio] by the end of the year. But as you know, we'll get a new stressed capital buffer in June on the heels of the DFAST/CCAR work that's just been submitted, and we'll have to see what that tells us. That's hard to forecast as you well know. And so based on what that tells us will inform that downward trajectory, but that is what we're focused on. The combination of funding growth that's accretive to returns and returning capital to shareholders in a way that's consistent with that repurchase program.","capital ratio, billion, cet1",yes,Yes,"cet1, capital ratio",No,,No,,Yes,"ccar, dfast",No,,No,,No,,No,
2025,Q1,Ebrahim Poonawala,"Understood. And I guess you mentioned, I think, in your prepared remarks, the reserves on the card book went up to 8.2%. Remind us, I mean, I think, and the genesis of both questions is I think there's a fragility to your RoTCE guidance for next year that I think makes investors nervous. And I'm just trying to get to the pieces around buybacks? And then in terms of credit, like how what's it baking in around the unemployment rate? What would cause you to ratchet up provisioning in the near term? What kind of an implied job market deterioration do we need to see for the credit outlook to deteriorate fast and materially? Thanks.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2025,Q1,Mark Mason,"Yes. Let me take that in a couple of different pieces. So, the first thing I'd say is that as I look at our credit exposure and I look at the consumer, the consumer continues to be resilient and discerning in their spend. And in fact, we did see spend hold up in the quarter, and we saw spend actually increase in our Branded Cards portfolio, up about 3%. The consumer has - we've seen a shift towards essentials and away from travel and entertainment. There's certainly a general performance that's consistent with what we've expected when we look at delinquencies, when we look at the loss rates that played to through the quarter, there are no surprises there as we think about that.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2025,Q1,Jane Fraser,And April is performing in line with that as well.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2025,Q1,Mark Mason,"Thank you. Yes. And April has been consistent that. As we think about reserves, we ended the quarter at about $23 billion of reserves across the entire business. That's about a 2.7% reserve-to-loan ratio. When I look at the drivers of that, as you know, when we establish when we do our [CECL] analysis on a quarterly basis, we have three scenarios that we run. A host of other stress scenarios, but that inform the [CECL] analysis, there are three scenarios, the base case scenario, there's a downside scenario and there's an upside scenario. And as we looked at the macroeconomic outlook and key variables that go into those scenarios, we assumed a deterioration in that macro-outlook. And we increased the probability or the weighting towards the downside scenario in light of what we were seeing in the macro environment. When you look through to some of the of the key variables, or one variables you referenced, unemployment, the average unemployment rate was 5.1% across those three scenarios. The unemployment rate in the downside scenario, the average was 6.7% across those eight quarters. And so, we've assumed some pretty meaningful shifts in unemployment, particularly on that downside our analysis. That informed the increase in our ACL reserves that's referenced in the deck. And that increase was offset a bit by the sequential reduction in volumes that is somewhat seasonal. So hopefully, that helps. We feel good about those reserves based on what we know and our current view of the macroeconomic environment, and we'll obviously do that on a quarterly basis as things continue to evolve.",billion,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2025,Q1,Operator,"Our next question comes from the line of John McDonald with Truist Securities. Your line is now open, please go ahead.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2025,Q1,John Mcdonald,"Thank you. Hi Mark, I wanted to ask you about capital optimization levers that you have to you've done, made some good progress in RWA mitigation. Is there still some room to go there. And then also, could you maybe increase the pace of DTA utilization to reduce the TCE density in a way to help the RoTCE goal.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2025,Q1,Mark Mason,"Yes, sure. So, look, we're always looking at opportunities to further optimize the use of capital. In Markets we've talked about last year a lot about the revenue to RWA as a tool that we've been using there. That's continued to increase that metric and ratio. We continue to look at, are we optimizing balance sheet and getting the broader revenue streams we'd expect from our client base, when we do our corporate lending work and some of that is showing up in how we've now introduced the revenue sharing as a tool to ensure we're capturing broader revenues from clients when we are using balance sheet. So, we're constantly working through this and identifying opportunities to ensure we're getting the highest return on that. In fact, as you look through the material we provided, you'll see that in light of the improvement we've seen across all of our businesses last year as well as our forecast for growth this year, there, in fact, is a shift in the TCE. And so,the allocated TCE has gone down for many of these businesses because they have shown good PPNR growth, good profitability. And so, as we stress test it internally, the stressed losses with the businesses have, in fact, come down. Now obviously, we have to adhere to the regulator stress test, and so that shifted from the businesses into Corporate/Other, but it is a positive sign as we think about how the stressed capital buffer might evolve and as we exit different parts of the franchise, the underlying segments are already showing that that improvement would suggest lower levels of stressed losses. And so that's another important point that we diligently manage even if we can't control the impact at the top of the house. Your point around DTA, we continue to focus on bringing the DTA down. As you know, that is largely driven by our ability to generate more U.S. income, which we're also very focused on. We did see a pickup this quarter, which is really just a timing difference pickup. It happens in the first quarter of every year. It is tied to deferred compensation and loan loss reserves as timing difference DTA and as we earn more income through the balance of the year and obviously create income tax liability, it will utilize that increase we saw or offset that that increase we saw in the first quarter here. We are targeting bringing down in 2025 and in 2026 in order to contribute optimizing capital.",revenue,yes,No,,No,,Yes,loan loss reserves,Yes,stress test,No,,No,,No,,No,
2025,Q1,John Mcdonald,"I wanted to ask Jane about the Banamex IPO planning. Just an update on where that stands, assuming that market conditions create some risk to the timing. Is it fair to say that there were pros and cons from the shareholder perspective to holding on to that business longer given that it's a profitable entity?",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2025,Q1,Jane Fraser,"Look, first of all, we continue to be on track with the preparation for the IPO, John. I was just down in Mexico last week. And the team is fully focused on driving Banamex's business performance. I was very pleased to see improvements and not the underlying drivers of their performance when is down there. And they're also focused on getting the work done to be able to go public, things like the prepared audited financial statements or filling the various regulatory requirements. As we told them we want to see the business performance improving and we want to make sure that we are doing everything in our control to be in a position to IPO by the year-end. And to the second part of your question, we will always look at what we believe to be in the best interest of our shareholders. We believe that the best interest of our shareholders is to be able to IPO this business. We think that is the right thing. It fits with Citi's strategy for all the reasons we've talked about in the past, we're the best owner of the corporate franchise we have there. We are not the best owner of a domestic bank. So, the timing of when we IPO will be driven by market conditions. It will be driven by the timing of regulatory approvals. So that could move that from 2025 into 2026. And we will always be guided by what we think will maximize value for our shareholders.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,

2025,Q1,Ken Usdin,"Thanks, good morning. I wanted to follow up on the points you made about the consumer hanging in there through April. And Mark, you mentioned that there could be more uncertainty as we get later. But I believe you're still intact with your charge-off guides for the year. I think just noticing Retail Services was, I think, expectedly higher than high end at 6.43%. Can you just remind us again how you're expecting the cadence of credit card losses to trajected for both Branded Cards and Retail Services as you go forward? Thanks.",charge-off,no,No,,No,,Yes,charge-off,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2025,Q1,Mark Mason,"Sure. Again, we do obviously feel that we are well reserved here. We did expect to see a pickup in the first half of the year before trending down in the back half of the year. And so that's kind of the cadence that we'd expect between now and the end of the year. The first half is usually seasonally higher than the back half of the year, and you see that in Retail Services. I would also point out that and you can see it in the deck and I think it's the second page of the appendix but also in the supplement, you are starting to see that delinquency buckets, we show the 90-day plus delinquency bucket starting to trend down in Retail Services, that is also an important indicator in terms of how we look at the expected losses, if you will, in the go forward. And so that seasonality as well as that trend is a good sign.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2025,Q1,Jane Fraser,"We've also, I think one of the pieces Gonzalo and the team have done a good job with is, they've been proactive and tightening risk and acquisitions and existing programs in the last couple of years. And I think that also puts us into another reason where we feel in a good position as we head into whatever lies ahead.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2025,Q1,Ken Usdin,"Very good. And one just a follow-up on NII and your outlook. Did you make any changes to including card fee still in the NII guide? Is that now removed? Does that fill in there? I know there's a lot of puts and takes given the change in the forward curve, if you can help us understand which curve you're using and some of the balancing act there, that would be great.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2025,Q1,Mark Mason,"Yes. So, look, the late fee impact is, for us, is important, and we included it in the range that we had given, and we still feel good. We've now removed it, obviously, with the changes that have taken place, but we have not changed our range because there's obviously going to be puts and takes that occur. It does have an impact on the Retail Services print that we have in the quarter and more importantly, the year-over-year that you see there of down 11% because, as you know, we share profits with those partners. And so that that that down 11% we see in the quarter is informed by last year where we had an assumption that the late fee rule was going to come into play and therefore, we had less profit to share with our partners versus this year first quarter where we've assumed it would not come into play and, therefore, have more profits to share with our partners. And so important to point that out on Retail Services, which jumps out in USPB, that it's unlikely that we see that downward percentage in the remaining quarters because it's really a byproduct of what we assumed last year. versus this year on late fees. In terms of the curve and the NII guidance we gave, we assumed two to three [U.S. interest rate] cuts. We're now assuming a fourth but given the timing and that it would be back-loaded in the year, it doesn't have a significant impact on the NII guidance that we've given, the 2% to 3% ex-Markets.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,

2025,Q1,Betsy Graseck,"And I know you indicated that you're looking to keep pace. And I'm wondering, does that mean at $1.75 billion or does that mean keep pace with the increased Q-on-Q, which was $250 million? And so, I know you're laughing, just trying to understand how you're thinking about that, given what we discussed last quarter, which is you have so much opportunity here for buyback and the accretion is so powerful. So, if you don't mind.","billion, million",no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2025,Q1,Mark Mason,"Sure. So, look, we're targeting a similar level. As you know, we've been working to bring the CET1 [Capital ratio] down. We brought it down 20 basis points this quarter. We're still focused on bringing it down to 13.1%. There is uncertainty. The uncertainty is multifaceted. And to some extent, you think about the uncertainty with the SCB. We'll hopefully get some clarity on that as we often do in the summer, and that will inform the pace at which we bring that that down. And then there's the broader market uncertainty, and we want to obviously be there to support clients, and the demand may come on the heels of that. And so, this quarter, like I said, similar level of share repurchases. $20 billion program that we will continue to work through. SCB clarity soon, hopefully, favorable clarity, and we're steadfast focused on it.

I just wanted to understand from your perspective on the transformation, how far along do you feel you are in the modernizing your infrastructure? And what kind of time frame do we have to go from here to check the box on that one, if you ever can check the box. And then separately on the Commercial Banking segment, if you could just give us some insights there, too.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2025,Q1,Jane Fraser,"Okay. There's a lot in there. So, as you remember, the transformation is a very large body of work. We're overhauling our infrastructure. We're reducing and modernizing our applications. We're simplifying our processes. And so, we're addressing the different root causes of what held us back, thoroughly and once and for all. And I feel good about the progress we've made. We're seeing more and more of the benefit into how we run bank. As you know, we fell behind in data, particularly regarding regulatory reporting. We've taken action to get that into shape, and we're confident in how that's now progressing. In many parts, the risk management compliance programs, we're already operating at or close to the target state. So, our focus is now ensuring we're delivering the risk reductions and the outcomes in a sustainable way. And I'm excited about the work we've been doing in making sure that our technology and our overall control environment is what we call modern and simple. We're simplifying and standardizing controls across common activities. We've put a lot more preventative and detective controls in place. We're upgrading others that weren't effective enough. We're driving automation. We're driving straight-through processing of our end-to-end processes across the bank. And you've heard us talk pretty consistently over the last couple of years about the work to make the technology infrastructure onto consolidating on to single platforms, retiring legacy applications. So, I'd say where we are as many of the efforts are now impacting how we run the bank better and more efficiently and in a much more controlled way. There's still work to do. And as you say, I'm not sure any bank finishes its modernization because the pace of innovation is there. And we're still innovating and investing in supporting our businesses, with new innovations in different areas. Talk briefly about AI, a lot of work in Services there, USPB and Andy in Wealth. So, there's a lot going on. I think you can tell I'm pretty excited about it. I'm pleased where we're headed and at the pace we're heading.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2025,Q1,Operator,"Our next question comes from the line of Erika Najarian with UBS. Your line is now open, please go ahead.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2025,Q1,Jane Fraser,"I forgot to do the Commercial Bank side. We can come back to it. Sorry, Betsy, I forgot to mention the Commercial Bank in my enthusiasm on our modernization efforts. Look, I think we are positioned to be the go-to bank for commercial clients. So, these are ones with cross-border needs. We've got these unique capabilities that, particularly the born-digital clients who are then going global very quickly, they can just sit on top of our existing capabilities in Services. And we help them go global. Then we help them think about their IPO or M&A or financing opportunities and the banking wallet builds on top of it. We've got quite a unique value proposition. I've been very pleased to see the growth we've been seeing in acquiring new companies, who will be the future major players as they grow in global economies. And this is happening in many of the big bright spots around the world. It's in India. It's in Australia. It's happening in Japan. It's happening through Europe as well as in North America. So, a lot of good future growth activities there, good returns.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,

2025,Q1,Erika Najarian,"Hi, good afternoon. Just a follow-up question here on the buyback pacing. Your message has been pretty clear about the first half versus the second half. That said, with the stock at $65 versus tangible book at $90, I guess, are you just so scared from the volatility of the SCB result that, that just must be hurdle before you can accelerate the buyback? And Mark, perhaps if you could sort of dispel some of the notion that sometimes happens in some of these chats with buy-siders about your inability to dividend from the bank sub to the holding company in order to increase your buybacks over the near term. If you could address that, too, that would be great.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2025,Q1,Mark Mason,"Yes, sure. So, look, we have accelerated the pace of buybacks. And I think this quarter is a good example where I had guided for $1.5 billion, and we kicked it up to $1.75 billion. And I think you should expect that as we see opportunities to continue to do that, then we're going to do it. And you should expect that given where we are trading relative to book value that we're constantly focused on those opportunities to take it up more than we had planned or more than expected. Look, I think we are, we have seen a lot of volatility in the SCB. And we're not the only ones. Other players in the industry have as well. I think we're encouraged by the dialogue that we're hearing, but there is still some risk to the SCB coming in different this year versus last year. And I think, I don't think we should lose sight. We're not losing sight of that. So, we'll get more clarity when the SCB comes, I think that will be important. We obviously are generating good earnings quarter after quarter, which obviously creates the capacity for us to do more here. And I think we've evidenced a willingness to do that. I think in terms of your other question with regard, your question implying whether there are any restrictions. We don't have any restrictions on the buybacks. We would not have announced a $20 billion buyback program if we didn't think we could execute the program in a reasonable amount of time. And so obviously, we disclosed what we dividend out from the bank, and you can look at that over the last three years, we've dividend somewhere in the range of $0 to $5 billion in any given quarter. But again, there are no restrictions imposed by the FRB, which governs the parent on the ability to pay dividends and buy back stock. In addition to that, we have multiple sources of funding, including loans to subsidiaries, which could be remitted as well as debt issuance programs as well as the earnings that are generated that put - we are well positioned to do, to execute on the program that we've described and to continue our desired pace of buybacks.","billion, ",yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2025,Q1,Erika Najarian,"Got it. And just my second question. Mark, you mentioned the four cuts that's now embedded in your NII outlook, I'm guessing that's for the U.S. How should we think about how you're thinking of global rates? Obviously, it's a basket of countries and currencies that we have to think about. And if your top exposures are exposed to lower rates, how should we think about deposit spreads in Services from here?",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2025,Q1,Mark Mason,"I think I'd say, I guess the easiest way to answer the question is to point to the IRE analysis that we show on a quarterly basis. And there are a lot of - that's obviously a risk measure. There are a lot of limitations associated with taking it too deeply or taking it too literally, but as you know, it is a view on how lower rates could impact Citi over a 12-month period. It assumes a static balance sheet, no growth, no change in composition or mix or changes in our hedging actions. And it is an instantaneous shock to the entire curve. With that said, we do break out the impact for U.S. dollar versus non-U.S. dollar. Remember, as you just referenced, there are over 60 currencies, but that asset sensitivity would suggest with a - in the fourth quarter - with a 100-basis point move across the currencies that the non-U.S. dollar impact would be $1 billion over a 12-month period. And so that take that with a grain of salt, but that gives you some sense as to the sensitivity to rates, that would assume all of those currencies and rates in those countries moved at the same time across the curve, and we did nothing to actively manage or dynamically manage the balance sheet.",billion,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2025,Q1,Operator,"Our next question comes from the line of Vivek Juneja with JPMorgan. Your line is now open, please go ahead.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2025,Q1,Vivek Juneja,"Thanks for taking my questions. A couple of them as follow-ups to questions that have been asked. First one for you, Mark. The doing buybacks of the dividending from the bank to the holding company that we just asked. How much are you willing to let your double leverage go up? Is there any sort of internal limits that you follow, what would be the implications of that from a funding cost standpoint?",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2025,Q1,Mark Mason,"Yes. Look, we have internal limits. We have management action triggers internally. We're not anywhere close to those limits or triggers. It's not something that I'm worried about as it relates to the buyback program that I have and/or the buybacks that we forecasted over the balance of the year.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2025,Q1,Vivek Juneja,"Jane, sharing about all turmoil and reading some new stories about mandates being shifted from U.S. broker-dealers to local players. Jane, are you concerned about that? Is that a shift that's starting outside the U.S. for big players like yourselves and others who are widespread globally, does this start to create stronger competitors or move some business away over time?",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2025,Q1,Jane Fraser,"No, it doesn't. We haven't seen any shifts of business away from us. And just remember the nature of our business. These are many of these markets around the world we've been in for over a century. We were the first bank in, sometimes we're the only international bank in, and we truly have a unique footprint that we are everywhere, and we're able to connect everything everywhere, and there aren’t other banks that have this. They don’t have the scale, they don't have the depth of local capabilities. They don't have the risk management skills. You don't have all of these different elements that the clients need now. And they need in this type of environment where things are shifting around. It's very easy to move your supply chains around on our platform, to shift the mix of different businesses. You're doing different geographies you're in. And as I said, a lot of the work we do is very local, and we're at the cutting-edge leading edge, in Services, both in TTS, custody, in particular, our corporate bankers have got very strong, deep relationships. We've got balance sheet strength. So, you tend to see flights to quality in these environments. And when you're in the emerging markets, there is only one word for quality, and that's Citi.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2025,Q1,Operator,"Our next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Your line is now open, please go ahead.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2025,Q1,Gerard Cassidy,"Hi Jane, Hi Mark. Mark, you touched on in your opening comments about the seasonal increase in trading-related assets. And then the growth was very strong. Was there any types of strategies that you guys employed? Because when you go back in other seasonal periods, first quarter of prior years, we've not seen this kind of growth. So, what led to this kind of success of growing your trading assets so well this quarter?",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2025,Q1,Mark Mason,"Yes. Again, it's the growth you've seen across the platform in both fixed income as well as equities and so that equities growth of 23% strong performance in derivatives in prime and prime balance growth tied to that particularly with hedge funds and asset managers as they looked at regional reallocation, strong contribution there. And then, rates and currencies, good increased client activity in portfolio trading. And then, we saw a lot of good spread product momentum driven by higher client activity and loan growth. And so, the nature of the activity, the structure of the products and what have you were all contributing factors there. Really strong performance across the business. And it obviously shows up in both the assets and the – the trading assets and the trading liabilities and the funding mechanisms associated with that.",loan growth,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2025,Q1,Gerard Cassidy,"Very good. And then as a quick follow-up, you guys gave us good details about the allocation of equity. I think it was Slide 23. I was curious, I noticed that you've lowered some. The total equity doesn't change, of course, but you did lower the allocation of the equity for different lines like Wealth and Banking. What was the thinking behind lowering it in the first quarter relative to 2024?",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2025,Q1,Mark Mason,"Yes. So, as you probably know, Gerard, we kind of look at this on an annual basis. It's a process that we run, and we run it at the end of the year with an eye towards how we want to make adjustments in the year that's following. As we looked at the performance of the business, overall, our five businesses have improved their PPNR and their profitability and therefore, improving their resiliency in stress scenarios and reducing their stress losses. And so, as we thought about that that underlying strength we saw as well as our forecast for what demand would be through 2025, those were important factors in that allocation or that attribution to the businesses for TCE. So, in a way, they're getting the benefit of that improved resiliency even before it shows up in our Stress Capital Buffer, right? And so, each of the businesses, we talked about Markets as a great example. We've been talking about optimizing use of capital, revenue to RWA, and the improvement all last year. We talked about that. And you see that showed up in their performance, but also showed up therefore, in the amount of TCE allocation that they have this year. So hopefully, that helps. Obviously, regulatory capital hasn't changed in the aggregate, that's comprised of the RWA, GSIB and Stress Capital Buffers. But over time, we'd expect, as we've talked about our strategy, we'd expect exits to obviously continue to come off the balance sheet, and we'd expect our strategy and the resiliency of our PPNR and the steadiness of those earnings to ultimately show up in our Stressed Capital Buffer.",revenue,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,Yes,gsib,No,,No,,No,

2025,Q1,Connor,"Hi, just a follow-up on the expenses, came in a bit lower than expected 1Q even ex the accounting change. What's your thought process for the rest of the year? Because I'm getting at is off in 1Q the high-water mark. So, if you trickle down a little bit from here, that would imply costs coming in a below what you're expecting. Can you just talk about the trajectory here?",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2025,Q1,Mark Mason,"Sure. So again, I gave kind of stuck to the guidance that we had given in January. So expenses $53.4 [billion] for the full year. We did come in at $13.4 [billion] in the quarter. I kind of went through the puts and takes around that. I'd expect probably a bit of a tick up in Q2 when I think about the things in front of us and some of the continued investments that we plan to make in transformation and some of the other things underneath that, like data and regulatory reporting. And then I'd expect it to trend down so that we get to the target of the $53.4 [billion] that I referenced for the full year.

And so, I'm very pleased as well with the caliber of the team that he has brought to bear here. We've got real horsepower and firepower in our investment capabilities. And he is also investing to improve client experience, a new relationship with Palantir here as well. And it's a team that's on the front foot. And in this environment, around the world, clients are really looking to us for advice because there are not many global wealth managers. They're looking to us for a global perspective, the capabilities we've got on the ground all around the globe and helping put them into good position amidst the uncertainty.

The strategy is working.",trillion,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q2,Jane Fraser,"Thank you, Liz, and good morning to everyone. I'm delighted to join you again today and first, I'm going to discuss the results of my first full quarter as CEO and then update you on the progress against our strategic priorities. For the quarter, we reported $6.2 billion in net income or $2.85 per share. We continue to benefit from an improving macro environment as evidenced by another significant release of our allowances for credit losses. Indeed, the pace of the macro recovery is exceeding earlier expectations across the globe and with it comes growing consumer and corporate confidence, and this also came through loud and clear in my conversations with clients over the course of the week I just spent in London. Now, clearly, we have to remain mindful of the unevenness in that global recovery due to continued contagion and challenges in vaccine distribution in several parts of the world, but we are optimistic about the momentum ahead and as a result, we deliberately accelerated some of our investments. In our Institutional businesses, we saw the expected normalization of fixed income trading compared to the striking volatility of Q2 last year. And our Equities franchise had a particularly strong quarter. Looking forward, we do expect the volatile markets to be higher than pre-COVID levels. Performance in our Investment Banking franchise remained healthy with good momentum in M&A and a very solid pipeline ahead for the rest of the year. We saw very good progress in our strategies to increase fee revenues with double-digit growth in our ICG fee revenues and specifically over 20% year-over-year fee growth in Treasury and Trade Solutions, in Securities Services and in the Private Bank. Now, TTS is the backbone of the unique global network we deliver for our clients and while the business continues to be impacted by low rates, we particularly like how we are positioned here from a market share perspective as the post-pandemic recovery takes shape. In Consumer Banking, while our loan book and revenues were impacted by the elevated payment rates in Cards, spending is well above pre-COVID levels now with a 38% increase in global purchase sales year over-year. We expect this to translate into loan growth in the second half of the year. And we continue to have good momentum in both deposit growth and AUMs across our Consumer franchises. In the US, as we discussed, we're investing in our home market as demonstrated by the well-received launch of our innovative Custom Cash Card in June. Internationally, the picture for our Consumer businesses diverges. So while there is still the softness in the Mexican economy, in Asia, loan growth returned and that's despite new COVID outbreaks. Turning to capital, for the first two quarters of 2021, we returned close to $7 billion to our shareholders, which was the maximum amount permitted under the Federal Reserve's rules. Going forward, we're committed to returning any excess capital over and above the amount necessary to invest in our franchise. So, while our stress capital buffer increased to 3% as a result of the Fed's recent stress test, that won't impact the Common Equity Tier 1 target we've been managing to of approximately 11.5%. We ended the quarter at 11.9% on a standardized basis and have excess capital to return to our shareholders through a healthy dividend and ongoing stock repurchase program. Lastly, our tangible book value per share increased to $77.87, up over 9% from a year ago. Now, let's turn to three of our strategic priorities: strategy, transformation and talent. I'm very pleased with the progress we've made on our strategy refresh. We have moved swiftly to begin the sales process for the 13 Consumer markets we plan to exit in Asia and EMEA. The first round of this was very encouraging and competitive, which isn't a surprise, because these are terrific businesses for the right owners. In those regions, we're off to a running start in our Wealth strategy. We're making significant strategic investments in product capabilities, technology and talent and have already seen this in increased client acquisition. We continue to do thorough and rigorous work to refresh our strategy across our Consumer Institutional businesses, guided by the four principles I outlined to you earlier in the year: being clinical, being focused, and ensuring both connectivity and simplification. Our overarching goal is to increase the returns we generate and close the gap with our peers by investing in the franchises that will drive the most growth – the three most notable of which are TTS, Wealth and Commercial Banking. And I'm very confident in the growth and return prospects these connected franchises will afford us. As we have done so far, we will share our decisions with you as we make them on the strategy. And we are also looking forward to presenting our plans to you more comprehensively during an Investor Day, which we intend to hold in the first quarter of next year. We're going to put our entire vision for the firm in front of you, so you can then hold us accountable for executing against it. As we discussed in the call last quarter, we're also working very hard and diligently on our transformation. This is a significant, it's also an exciting body of work and we're working closely with our regulators to meet their expectations and we intend to submit our plans to them this quarter. Now, while addressing the consent orders is an intense focus of the transformation, our work here goes well beyond the orders themselves. We've set out to modernize our bank. We want to achieve nothing less than excellence and this means investing in our risk and control environment but also in the infrastructure we need to serve our clients in an increasingly digital world. So let me give you an example in TTS. These investments will improve the scalability of our platform. Automation will drive efficiency and client experience, and investments in data will enhance revenues. And the investments we're making will help position us to retain our leading position as the preeminent global corporate bank. And that leads me finally to talent, where we have made material progress over the last few months. I'm delighted with the caliber of talent we have been attracting to the firm to grow our businesses and support our transformation. We've enhanced our existing ranks with best-in-market hires in data, risk, strategy and controls as well as in the front lines of Wealth, the Commercial Bank and BCMA in particular. We continue to invest in a culture of excellence and our own people, providing them with new leadership and growth opportunities, and it's this combination of new perspectives and our existing high caliber talent pool that will enable us to take the firm forward with excellence, urgency and accountability. Now, before I turn it over to Mark, I would like to thank Liz Lynn for her great work leading our investor relation efforts over the past several years. And as you know and as she mentioned, she is going to be our finance lead for BCMA where we all know that she is going to do a wonderful job. With that, Mark will go through our presentation and then we'll both be happy to take your questions.","billion, loan growth, net income, ",yes,Yes,common equity tier 1,No,,No,,Yes,stress test,No,,Yes,federal reserve,No,,No,
2021,Q2,Mark Mason,"Thank you, Jane, and good morning, everyone. Starting on slide 3, Citigroup reported second quarter net income of $6.2 billion, EPS of $2.85, and a 15.2% RoTCE. Revenues declined 12% from the prior year, reflecting a normalization in Fixed Income Markets along with lower card loans in Consumer as well as the impact of lower interest rates. Expenses were up 7% year-over-year. In constant dollars, expenses were up 4%, reflecting a normalization relative to the low print last year, along with continued investments in our transformation as well as other strategic investments, partially offset by productivity savings. Credit performance remained strong with net credit losses of $1.3 billion, more than offset by an ACL release of $2.4 billion, reflecting portfolio improvements as well as the continued improvement in our macroeconomic outlook. In constant dollars, end of period loans declined 3% year-over-year, reflecting higher repayment rates across Institutional and Consumer, although I would note that we are starting to see some pockets of loan growth emerge, and for the first time in over a year, loans were up sequentially. Deposits grew modestly, up 4% year-over-year, reflecting continued engagement with our Consumer and Corporate clients. Looking at the first half of 2021, total revenues declined 9% year-over-year and 10% in constant dollars, mainly driven by the normalization in Fixed Income Markets and lower card balances in Consumer, although we did see strong fee revenue growth across Consumer and in ICG, excluding Fixed Income Markets. Total expenses were up 6% on a reported basis and 3% in constant dollars, midway through the year. I'll talk more about our outlook for the remainder of the year in a moment. Cost of credit was a benefit of roughly $3 billion as we released over $6 billion in reserves. And we delivered roughly $14 billion in net income and an RoTCE of 17.6%. Finally, as Jane noted earlier, we returned roughly $7 billion in capital so far this year. And we remain committed to continuing to invest in our franchise as well as returning any excess capital to shareholders given the flexibility provided by the SCB framework. Turning now to each business. Slide 4 shows the results for the Institutional Clients Group. For the quarter, ICG delivered EBT of $4.9 billion, up significantly from last year. Revenues decreased 14%, driven mainly by the decline in Fixed Income Markets. Expenses increased 4% and were up 2% in constant dollars as investments in transformation along with other strategic investments were mostly offset by lower incentive compensation and efficiency savings. Credit costs were down considerably given a roughly $900 million ACL release as well as lower net credit losses, and ICG delivered a 16.4% return on allocated capital. Slide 5 shows revenues for the Institutional Clients Group in more detail. Product revenues were down 17% in the second quarter, primarily reflecting a comparison to a strong prior year period, particularly in Fixed Income Markets. However, we are continuing to see robust client engagement and strong underlying growth in our fee businesses across the franchise, including TTS, Investment Banking, Securities Services, Commercial Banking and the Private Bank. And excluding the markets related component, non-interest revenues were up 24% this quarter and we are confident in our outlook for continued strong fee growth in the back half of the year. Looking at the results in greater detail, on the Banking side, revenues decreased 1%. In Treasury and Trade Solutions, significant growth in fee revenues of roughly 25% reflecting solid client engagement as well as growth in trade were more than offset by the impact of lower interest rates, with revenues down 1%. We're continuing to see momentum across our Payments business with 13% growth in cross-border flows and 10% growth in clearing volumes over the past year, as well as the early days of a recovery in Commercial Cards. And as of the end of the quarter, TTS loans grew roughly 5%, reflecting increasing client demand and improving macroeconomic conditions. Investment Banking revenues were up 1% as higher M&A and equity underwriting revenues were largely offset by a decline in debt underwriting. While the overall DCM wallet was up in the second quarter, all the growth was in non-investment grade, which did not benefit our results given our skew to investment grade. But looking at results versus a more normal year, revenues were up 38% versus the second quarter of 2019 with strong growth across all products. Private Bank revenues grew 4% driven by higher fees and lending volumes, reflecting momentum with both new and existing clients, partially offset by the impact of lower interest rates. Corporate Lending revenues were down 15%, primarily driven by lower volumes. Total Markets and Securities Services revenues decreased 30% from last year. Fixed Income revenues decreased 43%, reflecting a comparison to a strong prior year period in both rates and spread products. However, we remained engaged with our clients with steady growth in both corporate and investor client revenues relative to the historical average. Equities revenues were up 37% versus last year, primarily driven by good performance in both derivatives and prime finance, reflecting robust client activity and favorable market conditions. In Securities Services, revenues were up 9% on a reported basis and 5% in constant dollars. Here we saw a strong growth in fee revenues with both new and existing clients, driven by growth in assets under custody and settlement volumes, partially offset by lower spreads. Finally, looking at first half results in ICG, we've seen a strong contribution from Investment Banking as well as good results in the Private Bank and Securities Services, which helped to offset the expected normalization in Fixed Income Markets. I would also note that Equity Markets revenues are up over 30%. Turning now to the results for Global Consumer Banking in constant dollars on slide 6. For the quarter, GCB delivered EBT of $2.4 billion, up significantly from last year. Revenues declined 10% as continued strong deposit growth, albeit with lower spreads and momentum in investment management, were more than offset by lower card balances across all three regions. In Cards, while we are encouraged by the continued improvement in consumer spending, with purchase sales up close to 40% versus last year and almost 20% versus last quarter, we are still seeing the impact of high payment rates on revenues. Expenses increased 7%, reflecting continued investments in our transformation as well as other strategic investments, along with an acceleration in marketing and higher volume related costs from the low point a year ago, partially offset by efficiency savings. Credit remains healthy and credit costs decreased significantly, driven by the $1.4 billion ACL reserve release and lower net credit losses. And GCB delivered a 20.8% return on allocated capital. Finally, looking at results for the first half of the year, we've seen steady improvement in our drivers, which gives us confidence in our outlook as we move into the back half of the year. Slide 7 shows the results for North America Consumer in more detail. Second quarter revenues were down 11% from last year, primarily driven by lower Cards revenues, but better than the 15% decline last quarter on a year-over-year basis. Revenues declined in both Branded Cards and Retail Services by 12% and 14%, respectively, reflecting continued headwinds from higher payment rates as consumers have continued to use liquidity from stimulus and other relief programs to pay down debt, driving lower loans and a shift in mix towards transactor balances. This is creating pressure on our net interest revenues, but it's also benefiting our delinquency and loss trends. However, we are continuing to see a recovery in sales activity, with purchase sales now above pre-pandemic levels led by discretionary spend, including travel and dining. In Branded Cards, total purchase sales were up 40% versus last year, and importantly, up 11% versus the second quarter of 2019. And in Retail Services, purchase sales also grew versus both second quarter 2019 and 2020. So, the good news is that we're continuing to see the recovery in spend and we're also returning to pre-COVID acquisition levels. Looking ahead, we expect the growth in purchase sales to translate into loan growth by the end of the year, as stimulus moderates and consumers return to more normal payment patterns. Turning to Retail Banking, revenues were down 7% year-over-year reflecting pressure from lower deposit spreads and lower mortgage revenues. That said, we are continuing to see good momentum as we grow and deepen our retail bank relationships as well as improve the quality and stickiness of these relationships. Average deposits were up 18%, including 24% growth in checking. And the number of Citigold households increased by 16%, contributing to a 23% increase in AUMs. On slide 8, we show results for International Consumer Banking in constant dollars. Revenues declined 6% year- over-year in the second quarter with an 11% decline in Latin America and a 3% decline in Asia. Looking at International Consumer overall, we are seeing good momentum in investment management with 15% growth in assets under management, primarily driven by Asia. And the numbers are meaningfully higher if you look specifically at the four international wealth hubs. Average deposit growth remains strong at 8%, albeit at lower deposit spreads. And similar to the US, we saw a 26% increase in purchase sales year-over-year, but Cards loan growth remained a challenge this quarter, with average card loans down 8% due to elevated payment rates. Slide 9 provides additional detail on Global Consumer credit trends. In the US, both NCL and delinquency rates remain favorable driven by the significant amount of customer liquidity due to stimulus and other relief programs. Given the delinquency trends we're seeing today, we do not expect credit deterioration in the US portfolio in 2021. And the ultimate timing and level of losses as we look into next year will depend on whether or not the stimulus results in a permanent benefit. And as expected, credit losses and delinquency rates trended downward in both Mexico and Asia, following a peak in the first quarter of 2021. So, overall, we're seeing a rebound in activity along with a consumer who is in a very healthy financial position, suggesting good momentum as we move into the back half of the year. Slide 10 shows the results for Corporate/Other. Revenues were down slightly in dollar terms as episodic gains this quarter were more than offset by previously disclosed one-time items in the prior year. Expenses were up slightly in dollar terms, mainly reflecting the impact of FX. And similar to last quarter, we have further allocated costs to the businesses related to investments in infrastructure, risk and controls. As we mentioned previously, this change had no impact to EBT at the Citi level. However, we have re-cast prior periods to enable better comparability of results. Credit costs declined year-over-year driven by a release this quarter compared to a build in the prior year. Finally, EBT was breakeven this quarter. Looking ahead, we would expect a quarterly pre-tax loss in the range of $200 million to $300 million for the remainder of 2021. Slide 11 shows our net interest revenue and margin trends as well as non-interest revenues on a reported basis. We've also provided net interest revenues in constant dollars on slide 19 in the appendix for a comparison to prior periods. In the second quarter, net interest revenue of $10.2 billion declined $880 million year-over-year, reflecting lower loan balances and the impact of lower rates. Sequentially, net interest revenue continued to stabilize as the extra day in the quarter was offset by lower Cards revenues. And net interest margin declined 3 basis points, driven by lower Cards NIR and modest growth in the balance sheet due to deposits, partially offset by the increase in Markets NIR in the quarter. Turning to non-interest revenues on the bottom of the slide, in the second quarter, non-NIR declined $1.4 billion driven by normalization in Fixed Income Markets. However, outside of Markets, we did see strong broad-based fee growth of over $600 million across GCB and ICG. And for the past two quarters, we've seen these fee revenues return to pre-pandemic levels of roughly $4.4 billion per quarter, pointing to a somewhat faster-than-expected recovery. Looking at these results midway through the year, we are comfortable with our prior outlook and continue to expect total Citi revenues to be down in the mid-single digit range on a full year basis, although the composition is likely to be somewhat different, which I will talk more about in a moment. On slide 12, we show our key capital metrics, which remain strong and stable again this quarter, allowing us to support clients and return capital to shareholders. Our CET1 Capital ratio increased to 11.9% as net income was mostly offset by buybacks and dividends. During the quarter, Citi returned a total of $4.1 billion to common shareholders in the form of $1.1 billion in dividends and share repurchases of $3 billion. Our Supplementary Leverage Ratio was 5.9%, a decline from the prior quarter, largely driven by the expiration of a temporary SLR relief. And our tangible book value per share grew by 9% to $77.87, driven by net income. Before we move on to Q&A, let me spend a few minutes on our outlook for 2021. On the top line, for total Citigroup, we still expect revenues to be down mid-single digits on a reported basis, but as I mentioned, the composition is likely to be somewhat different than we originally anticipated. Year-to-date, we've seen stronger than expected growth in non-interest revenues. And we do expect the strength in fee growth to continue in the back half of the year, driven primarily by ICG. Meanwhile, for net interest revenues, we expect continued stabilization in the back half. And we should start to see some loan growth by the end of the year. So while net interest revenues are down roughly $2.2 billion year-to-date, just outside our original outlook for the full year, assuming this base case holds, we do not expect a significant further decline in net interest revenues from here on a full year basis. So, again, in aggregate, for total Citigroup, we still expect revenues to be down mid-single digits. On the expense side, based on our latest work on the strategic refresh, we've made the decision to further accelerate certain strategic investments, in part in reaction to what is shaping up to be a faster than expected recovery. As a result, we now expect total Citigroup expenses to be up mid-single digits. These are strategic investments that we are making to strengthen our franchise and drive long-term growth. For example, we've accelerated investments where we believe there are significant opportunities for growth, including holistically across Wealth and the Commercial Bank. We've also doubled down on our existing strengths in businesses like TTS, Securities Services and the Investment Banking business. Finally, given the faster recovery we are seeing today, we are accelerating investments in areas like cards marketing to capture this upside. All of these investments will have significant benefits over time. Meanwhile, expenses related directly to the transformation, which we had expected to drive the 2% to 3% increase in total Citi expenses this year, are coming in largely as expected. These investments include the work around the consent order as well as the broader work to modernize the bank, which will improve our risk and control environment as well as allow us to better meet the needs of our customers and clients through an improved operating environment, leading to faster decision-making, better efficiency and improved client experience. And I'd point out that the mix of this spend is 30% technology and 70% non tech related investments. Finally, this outlook includes the realization of productivity savings as a by-product of the investments we've been making over the past few years. And to be clear, we will continue, as we have done in the past, to look for ways to operate as efficiently as possible during this investment period. And one additional note. We could also see some episodic impacts this year related to the market exits we are pursuing. And as I've mentioned previously, we will be very transparent about the impact of these actions on our financials. So, in summary, we feel good about the investments that we are making and firmly believe these investments will position us well to close our return gap to peers over time. With that, Jane and I would be happy to take your questions.","capital ratio, billion, , revenue, net income, liquidity, million, loan growth, cet1",yes,Yes,"cet1, capital ratio",No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,Yes,"leverage ratio, net interest margin"
2021,Q2,"Question And Answer
Operator",Your first question is from the line of John McDonald with Autonomous Research. Please go ahead with your questions.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q2,John Mcdonald,"Hi. Good morning. Mark, thanks for the comments at the end there about the expense outlook and the revision to your outlook for this year. Just wondering if you could just unpack that a little bit more. You're not the only bank that's been kind of raising expense guidance. So I was wondering how much of this might be inflationary due to the cost of doing business as a big bank here and how much is Citi specific? And does the run rate that you're expecting to be at on expenses in the back half of this year feel like that's the run rate you'd go into next year with or are there things that are elevated this year? Thank you.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q2,Mark Mason,"Yeah. Good morning, John. Thanks for the question. Look, I start by saying and repeating a little bit of what I said in my remarks, which is that we are taking a very deliberate decision on how we manage the franchise, right? And so what I spoke to was Jane and I along with the leadership team are going through a very thoughtful strategy refresh. And as we go through that, we are identifying, particularly given the pace of the recovery, some real strategic opportunities to invest in the franchise. And we don't want to – we're not going to miss this window of opportunity. You've heard me mention that before. And it's in parts of the franchise that will undoubtedly grow and are high returning. So when we talk about TTS, we talk about the Commercial Banking business, we talk about Wealth, those are businesses that have strong growth prospects and have returns that are north of 20% in a normal environment. And so like I said, we're jumping at that. On the transformation side, I've been very clear and consistent that we expected that to drive the 2% to 3% increase year-over-year. That's coming in largely as expected and again, the right thing to do, and important thing to do to modernize this bank. Inflation, of course, is going to be a factor, particularly as we look at labor and the competition for talent but again, that's – we deal with that on a regular basis and we continue to look for productivity and efficiency savings that largely tend to offset that. In terms of 2022, I'm not going to give any guidance on that. But again, this is, I think, an important period of time as we come out of this to ensure we're putting money to work in a smart fashion that prepares the firm for the future.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q2,Operator,Your next question will come from Jim Mitchell with Seaport Research.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q2,Mark Mason,Good morning.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q2,Jim Mitchell,"Maybe the first question – hey, good morning. Maybe first question on Branded Cards in North America. Average balances were pretty flat, but there was a little pressure on spread. Can you just maybe clear that up? Is that just sort of greater user rate activity or does that bounce back? How do we think about the revenue trajectory there and the spread compression we saw this quarter?",revenue,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q2,Mark Mason,"Yeah. So, again, the dynamic on Cards revenues, Branded Cards in particular in North America which were down 12%, is largely driven by what we're seeing in the way of loan balances. And if you look at average interest earning balances, our average interest earning balances for Branded Cards are down about 11%. Now, the good news is, as we've said, purchase sale activity is up meaningfully year-over-year and relative to the prior quarter, but it's really those payment rates are remaining quite high, quite elevated. The good news is that plays through in the form of a benefit as it relates to cost of credit, lower losses than expected, and now lower reserves as we see releases. But it's really that dynamic of payment rates high, lower loan volumes - average interest earning in particular - that is putting pressure on that top line.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q2,Jim Mitchell,"All right. That's helpful for the clarification on the transactor balances. And then maybe just more broadly on the Wealth business, you guys put out a press release saying you made some significant investments in new hires in Asia Wealth with a pretty substantial and aggressive target to grow head count. Where do you stand on that build-out? And are you making similar investments in other markets?",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q2,Jane Fraser,"Yes. Look, I think as we said, we're pretty excited about the Wealth opportunity for us because we have all the different pieces to be successful here: the brand, the client relationships, the platform, the Commercial Banking franchise. And we're already a sizable player. We're number three in Asia, for example, where a lot of the growth is coming from. The opportunity for us is pulling all of the pieces together into a single integrated offering across the full spectrum of clients and so we've been investing in that platform, the technology. You'll have seen the announcement yesterday in the US about a self-directed digital offering there. We've been expanding and growing talent in the front line as well and are very pleased as well with the investment product revenue growth which is where from a mix point of view we see the greatest upside for us. So early days in the execution of this, but I think pleasing progress as we pull this together into this single integrated offering, invest behind it and you'll see the benefits in terms of growth as well as obviously return and revenue mix going forward for the bank.",revenue,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q2,Mark Mason,"Yeah. Jane, only thing I would add to that, we are already seeing good performance in the quarter, right? So Private Bank revenues up 4%, continued strong growth in client assets up 26% including AUMs that were up 29% and deposit strength, et cetera. And as Jane mentioned, even as we invest in strengthening the platform, we just announced yesterday that we were launching the self-directed investment digital offering which, again, is targeted towards US Consumer and Wealth Management clients. And so good progress while we invest and position ourselves to capture further opportunity here.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q2,Operator,Your next question comes from Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Please proceed.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q2,Ken Usdin,"Thanks. Good morning, Jane and Mark.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q2,Mark Mason,Good morning.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q2,Ken Usdin,"Wanted to ask you a little bit just on capital. When we got the SCB results, you had indicated a dividend of at least $0.51 and implied that you'd be buying back stock, but just wondering if you could help us just flush that out a little bit more in terms of how we should be thinking about the type of capital return or any increases that you might consider on the dividend from here? And how to put that into context with prospective changes in the SCB and your minimums?",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q2,Mark Mason,"Sure. Look, the first thing I'd say is that as you can tell through the second quarter, we bought back as much as the regulatory rules would allow for in the way of the average four quarters of net income. And so we continue to be very excited about the prospect of continued capital return. As it relates to the SCB and the recent results, as you know, we have a target of approximately 11.5% from a CET1 ratio point of view. The target includes an estimate for the stress capital buffer that's somewhere between 2.5% and 3%. Up until this recent set of results, the prior couple had been at the 2.5%. The 3% will go into effect at the end of the third quarter. And more importantly, we will actively manage the drivers that impact that stress capital buffer. That is to say, PPNR as well as the balance sheet, risk weighted assets, and we intend to do so with an eye towards how we bring that stress capital buffer back down. As we think about capital actions, as you know, with the SCB in place, we have the flexibility to take those decisions in a given quarter in line with the reg minimums and we intend to do that. Given where the stock trades, it makes a lot of sense for us to be buying back shares and so we'll continue to skew towards that. And as of right now, our dividend is going to remain at the $0.51, but as I mentioned, we will continue to lookat that quarter-to-quarter, given the flexibility from the SCB.",", net income, cet1",yes,Yes,cet1,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,Yes,cet1 ratio
2021,Q2,Jane Fraser,"And the only piece I'd add in is as we're doing this work on the strategy and the plans going forward, both Mark and I have a high degree of confidence around the capital generating capability of the franchise and look forward to returning excess capital to you over and above what we'll be doing to invest and close that return gap with our peers.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q2,Operator,Your next question will come from Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. MATT O’,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q2,Connor,"Good morning. I just wanted to follow up on the dividend commentary. I understand the preference to buy back stock and you're very explicit about wanting to do that below tangible book, so that makes sense. But I guess just kind of signaling the market, keeping a stable dividend, is there like a message there about the underlying earnings power or limited ability to increase the dividend? Because I'd think you'd want to at least top it up by a couple of pennies, just to kind of signal a positive trend, because it doesn't take that much capital to do that. So maybe you can elaborate a little bit on the dividend, again specifically on should we read into implied underlying earnings power? Are there any limits on increasing the dividend? Thank you.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q2,Mark Mason,"Yeah. Let me be very clear. There's no underlying message there at all. It's as I stated in terms of where the stock is trading and it making sense to do buybacks. Our dividend yield is quite comparable to that of peers at close to 3%. And so – and there's no constraint on our ability to take capital actions. And we don't have any concerns about the earning power of the franchise. And in fact, many of the areas, as I mentioned earlier and as Jane has mentioned, we know are going to contribute to continued strength in our earnings power. So, well capitalized. We feel good about our earnings power and no concerns or no underlying message to the capital actions and direction of them that we spoke to. And again, we have the flexibility given the stress capital buffer as we go quarter-to-quarter to adjust as we see fit in the best interest of our investors.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q2,Operator,"Your next question will come from Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research. Hello, Steven, your line is open.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q2,Steven Chubak,"Mark, I was hoping to unpack just some of the NII guidance. I think there was just a little bit of confusion how it should be interpreted. So, it sounds like we're down $2.2 billion year-to-date and that the full year we shouldn't see any incremental declines from there. So that would imply about $10.5 billion NII run rate in the back half. I just want to make sure that's the right way to interpret the remarks.",billion,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q2,Mark Mason,"Yeah. So, look, again, we do see kind of the NIR stabilizing and you see some of that particularly ex-markets but also in total on the page. Again, the guidance for total revenue is unchanged at down mid-single digits. You're right, as of the half, we're at down $2.2 billion as relates to net interest revenues. Look, the markets component of that can often be hard to predict, but what I'm suggesting is that any offset or any further pressure there will be offset likely in the fee momentum that we expect to see given the strength coming through this quarter.","billion, revenue",yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,

2021,Q2,Mark Mason,"Hey, Betsy. Good morning.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q2,Betsy Graseck,"Oh, hey. Thanks. Okay. I did have a question for Jane and you, Mark. The question has to do with how you're thinking about the importance of scale in the business refresh, I guess, I could call it that you're doing? And Jane, really, maybe you could help us understand how important scale is in what you're looking to execute here? I ask because many times I get questions from investors around what is Citi doing on the pieces of the business that don't have as much scale as the standout areas like Global, Fixed or Treasury Services or Mexico.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q2,Jane Fraser,"Yes. First of all, scale is clearly very, very important here, particularly in a more digital world and as you point out, Betsy, TTS, for example, has – we're moving $4 trillion of volume a day around the world and we've got a number of franchises that have material scale and we only expect them to be growing and this is where the transformation program will be very helpful in ensuring the scalability of our platforms. We made the decision on Asia Pac and EMEA to exit the 13 markets where we didn't believe that we would be able to achieve the scale needed to compete in those very local part of the business so that we can focus our firepower in those areas where we're either ensuring we retain a leading market position or in other areas where we want to be investing to attain the scale that we think is going to be needed going forward. US Consumer is an obvious example of that. So I think as we – you'll hear from us going forward, more and more focus around what are our plans for those businesses for retaining the leading positions in this, aided by the transformation program, or in the areas where we'll be investing to attain greater scale and as I say, US Consumer is the obvious one. There are pockets in Commercial Bank we're excited by. Securities Services is one where we think it is very readily attainable, particularly given our pre and post trade capabilities and part of that scale, finally, will come from the linkages between our businesses as we create more connectivity. That will also provide us scale, so collectively the different franchises we have will be competitively advantaged and not just individually strong.",trillion,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,

2021,Q2,Ebrahim Poonawala,"Just a follow-up – understand you're being deliberately in strategy leading up to, I guess, the Investor Day you mentioned next – first quarter next year. But as we think about just the investment spend and the expense outlook, handicap, Mark, if you could, the risk that we could see a little bit of an expense creep as you dig further deeper into this, both in terms of your guidance for mid-single digit expense growth this year and as we think about just the duration of that investment cycle over the next few years.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q2,Mark Mason,"Yeah. Look, again, this is something that we control, right? So, again, I want to reiterate that we are making very deliberate decisions around the opportunities that we see across the franchise. And it's the right thing to do, right? So we're going to continue to do that. In terms of kind of risk to it, I don't think there are any surprises here, right? If revenues come in meaningfully different, there's a certain component of our expense base that's tied to revenues and so that would obviously move around. But aside from those volume-related expenses, transaction, compensation, et cetera, you should expect what I've guided towards in terms of the very deliberate decisions to put the money to work in this fashion and we're going to continue to do that. If we see more investment opportunities in 2021 or 2022, we're going to go after them because, again, we know that we can deliver on the benefits and the returns that are associated with putting that money to work.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,

2021,Q2,Gerard Cassidy,"Mark, you said something interesting about the Investment Banking business revenues. I think you said that they were 39% or 38% higher than 2019. I'm checking my notes here. So your business is still nicely above the 2019 levels and we came through a period up until the pandemic that you're well aware of that it was somewhat challenging, the growth in Investment Banking and Trading businesses. As you look forward when you talk to your people in Investment Banking and in Global Markets, where do they see this? Because there seems to be an elevated amount of business due to what we just came through in the last 18 months. Do they think it's sustainable or do we get back to a 2019? What are those guys telling you about the next 12 to 24 months in those businesses?",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q2,Mark Mason,"Yeah. I'd start by saying we continue to have very, very good dialogue with our clients across the franchise and specifically in Investment Banking. And if you think about it, many businesses, many companies across industries are really having to take a look at their business model and think about how they want to transform their businesses coming out of this pandemic. Everything from how to think about digitization, how to think about going direct to consumers, what the pandemic means for supply chains, how people work remotely, how they manage their liquidity levels, what to do with that excess liquidity. Should they be buying or what? And so we're part of that dialogue, which is incredibly representative, I think – it represents strongly the franchise that we have. The general view from our clients is optimistic in terms of the go-forward environment. Yes, there's some things to kind of manage to, but there's a general level of optimism. And so what I represented relative to 2019 is while we are seeing normalization, we're normalizing at a higher level than where we ended in 2019 and we'd expect continued momentum and we'd expect to continue to take share over time. Jane, anything you want to add to that?",liquidity,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q2,Jane Fraser,"Yeah. Mark, I think you covered it very well. There's a high level of client engagement with us at the moment really around the world and a lot of demand. We're seeing in addition to the Investment Banking side, this shift to e- commerce with clients needing our TTS services, our cross-border flows. We're seeing this translating into demand in trade starting to pick up nicely. The Commercial Banking side is another area that we're seeing a lot of new demand coming through from clients both from strategic activity with our investment bank as well as their own expansion globally that we're supporting them through our Treasury Services and the like. So I think there's a general sense of optimism. We have a fabulous pipeline. One never wants to jinx these things, but we really have a fabulous pipeline heading into the second half of the year around the world and it does give you a good sense of confidence of continued momentum.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,

2021,Q2,Mike Mayo,"Hi. I'm going to ask my question here and then re-queue. The real question is just on capital. I mean, you're not blind to the fact that your tangible book value is $78 and your stock price is $68. So, we should probably be selling your desk chairs and your silverware and anything you can to buy back your stock, I would think. So, along those lines, the first question is when you're looking at these sales of assets, 13 Consumer markets, do you expect to have a gain on those or a loss on those relative to where they're marked currently?",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q2,Mark Mason,"Yeah. So, look, I mean, I think I'd tell you, Mike, that we, as Jane mentioned, we've seen strong interest from buyers as it relates to those assets. And there's no surprise, just given we think those are good businesses, just not of scale as Jane mentioned for us. We've got to run that process through and see what that results in and I'll continue to be transparent with you as to where gains and losses or how it flows through our financials, but I'm not going to sit here and tell you whether it's gains or losses or what it means specifically for those 13 markets. What I will tell you is that as capital is freed up from those transactions, we'll continue to make very deliberate decisions around what to do with that capital, first, looking at growth opportunities that can deliver returns above our cost of capital, and then looking towards how we can return as much of it to shareholders as it makes sense in the form of buybacks, dividends, et cetera. And we've been disciplined about that to date and we're going to continue to be disciplined about that.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q2,Mike Mayo,"So, to clarify, if I got this right, your CET1 ratio is 11.9% and your return on capital above 11.5%. So, if you were to quantify the dollar amount of that, how much would that mean in potential buybacks at this point and then I assume that would not include any capital freed up from any sale? So, you could have potential to buy back a lot of stock if you were willing and able, is that correct?",cet1,no,Yes,cet1,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,Yes,cet1 ratio
2021,Q2,Mark Mason,A little bit over $4 billion of excess capital between the 11.5% and the 11.9% and so that's what that equates to.,billion,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q2,Operator,Your next and final question will come from Vivek Juneja with JPMorgan. Please proceed.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q2,Vivek Juneja,Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. A couple.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q2,Mark Mason,Good morning.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q2,Vivek Juneja,"Good morning. Mark, any comments on promotional trends that you're seeing in card pricing, given everybody is back focusing on the business? You mentioned marketing spend, but can you talk a little about what you're seeing in promotional pricing in that?",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q2,Mark Mason,"Yeah. I guess, what I'd say is simply that as expenses would suggest and as we stated, we are legging back into bringing on new card customers. And so – and what we're seeing is that our acquisitions are largely at pre- COVID, pre-crisis or pre-pandemic levels and, frankly, we're seeing normal behaviors as those card customers come on. And as has always been the case, it's going to be a mix in terms of the acquisition strategy, but thus far, we're seeing normal behaviors, if you will. And look, the new account acquisitions skewed towards Branded Cards and they're in products that are less reliant on the 0% offers and products like Flex Pay and Flex Loan, which will generate interest immediately as those balances grow.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q2,Operator,We do have one more question in queue from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q2,Mike Mayo,"Hi. An unrelated question. Just, Jane, as you think about the technology approach, doing it yourself through Citigroup and pairing up with partners, what's the status of the relationship with Google and Google Plex and your desire to use third-parties to gather new customers at lower initial cost, but maybe not as much lifetime value? If you think of that trade-off, what's your current thinking today? And we haven't heard much about the Google relationship despite some initial headlines. Thanks.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q2,Jane Fraser,"Yeah, hey there, Mike. Excellent question. The partnership with big tech is an important part of our disrupter strategy in the US as we're looking at both how do we enhance value propositions to customers, the customer base itself, and then these new ecosystems that are evolving. And I think there's no question that COVID has accelerated the embedded finance model in the US, just think of the travel ecosystem, think of home improvement ecosystems. The benefit we've got is that for us, it's not a new space to us. We've been very much engaged with partners in Asia, Grab, Paytm, and WeBank as well as our traditional partners. What we find with these partnerships is that we learn a lot because it's still early days in the development of these new ecosystems. We learn a lot about marketing, about user experiences, around the tech stacks. It's certainly enables us to tap into next generation customer bases, but also importantly, it goes beyond consumer. And so if we look on the corporate side, our partnership with Stripe, the work that we're doing in TTS with Project Spring of enabling payments is a core piece, particularly as wholesale and retail kind of collapses some of these payment chains into one. So with Google Plex and several other tech partnerships that we have in the States and elsewhere in the world, we're very deliberately going about creating a broad suite of APIs and partner integration capabilities so that we're able to integrate other partners into our offerings, develop more innovative solutions without necessarily having to build it or buy it all ourselves. And Citi Plex with Google is an example of that. We are actively testing features with our own employees at the moment. We'll be finalizing dates. We'll share that with you when available. But it's one of many different partnerships that we have and an important partner for us, but far from the only one here in the States to help us disrupt and grow going forward.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q2,Operator,We do have a follow-up question from Vivek Juneja with JPMorgan.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q2,Vivek Juneja,"Hi. Sorry. But I kind of have a second question and that's on capital. Given that you're headed towards a higher GSIB bucket, Mark, Jane, what you're all thinking in terms of that, in terms of not just capital targets, anything you can do about that, because I know that's a year – a little over a year away from going into effect, but obviously, you're thinking about target capital, we'll have to keep in mind what's coming down the pipe for you.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,Yes,gsib,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q2,Mark Mason,"Sure. And look, as you know, with all of the liquidity in the market, many of us have seen pressure on our GSIB score. That certainly has been the case for us and it wouldn't go into effect, the higher GSIB score of 3.5% until the beginning of 2023. And we look at the entire capital stack holistically, the 11.5% target in our case, which is well above reg minimums, but certainly does consider that in it. And there are elements of that, as I mentioned earlier, that we can influence and control. So the stress capital buffer is part of that, and I talked earlier about our ability to influence those levers without having full understanding of the Fed models, we know we can influence PPNR, we know we can influence the balance sheet and how it gets allocated and ultimately, what stress losses come out of it. And so we will continue to manage that. We will still have a buffer obviously, even with a higher GSIB score. And as you know, regulators continue to talk about capital as being at about the right levels in the system and they'll continue to look at drivers that influence the stack as well, including GSIB and balance sheet size, et cetera, and we'll see how that evolves. But again, we feel good about where we are. We're well capitalized. We have a good sense for the drivers going forward that will create capital capacity for us and we intend to, again, invest that where it makes sense and return that otherwise to our shareholders.",liquidity,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,Yes,gsib,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q2,Operator,I would now like to turn the call back over to Elizabeth Lynn for closing remarks.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q2,Elizabeth Lynn,Thank you all for joining today's call. Please feel free to reach out to us in IR with any follow-up questions and thank you again and have a nice day.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q2,Jennifer Landis,"Thank you, operator. And thank you all for joining us. I'd like to remind you that today's presentation, which is available for download on our website, citigroup.com, may contain forward-looking statements which are based on management's current expectations and are subject to uncertainty and changes in circumstances. Actual results may differ materially from these statements due to a variety of factors including those described in our SEC filings. With that, I'll turn it over to Jane.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q2,Jane Fraser,"Thank you, Jenn and thank you everyone for joining us today. When we last spoke, we said the macro and geopolitical outlook was complex and uncertain, so in one sense, little has changed. However, the headwinds have certainly crystallized. And it's against that backdrop that I'm proud of the results our team delivered this quarter as we execute on our strategy and transformation. There are mounting costs to the series of supply shocks we've experienced, and now we need to pay attention to an additional S in ESG, and that is security. In addition to energy and cybersecurity, food security has also come into sharper focus, threatening to spread the humanitarian cost of the war well beyond Europe. Resiliency is the new priority for governments and corporates alike. And all of this is adding to inflationary pressures which are in turn being met with a more hawkish response from the Fed and other central banks, all contributing to sharply lower US consumer confidence. Higher rates and QT will keep volatility high. That said, while sentiment has shifted, little of the data I see tells me the US is on the cusp of a recession. Consumer spending remains well above pre-COVID levels, with household savings providing a cushion for future stress, and as any employer will tell you, the job market remains very tight. Similarly, our corporate clients see robust demand and healthy balance sheets, with revenue softness attributed to supply chain constraints so far. So, while a recession could indeed take place over the next two years in the US, it's highly unlikely to be a sharper downturn as others in recent memory. I'm just back from Europe, where it's a different story. We expect a very difficult winter is coming, and that's due to disruptions in the energy supply. There is also increasing concern about the second-order effects on industrial production and how that will affect economic activity across the continent. And the mood is, of course, further darkened by the belief that the war in Ukraine will not end anytime soon. In Asia, a rebound in China also faces some constraints, given the potential for future lockdowns, the amount of leverage in the Chinese economy, and stress in their property sector. Given this uncertain environment, I'm quite pleased with our overall performance. We reported net income of $4.5 billion, an EPS of $2.19, and an RoTCE of 11.2%. We grew revenues at 11% year-over-year, whilst remaining on track to meet our expense guidance for the year. Services continued to show excellent momentum, with revenues up 28% year-over-year. While some of that growth is a result of the rate environment, we had double-digit fee growth, consistent with the strategy we presented to you in March. TTS in particular fired on all cylinders as clients took advantage of our global network, leading to the best quarter this business has had in a decade. The market volatility that we saw in the first quarter continued into the second, driving corporate clients in particular to be more active in risk management, contributing to revenue growth of 25% in Markets. The volatility we saw in foreign exchange rates, commodities, and equity derivatives favored our mix, and we were more efficient in our capital usage. Now, while this level of activity is related to where we are in the current cycle rather than a new baseline end market, I believe we are helping our clients navigate this environment quite well, and it shows how our emphasis on our corporate clients globally, given their consistent trading needs, is a differentiating one for us in Markets. On the flip side, that same environment continues to put a great deal of pressure on the investment banking wallet, with our revenues down 46%. However, we are seeing an increase of lending as our clients are being less inclined to obtain financing through the debt markets given the recent swings. In US Personal Banking, the positive drivers we saw in our two credit card businesses over the last few quarters converted into solid revenue growth this quarter, most notably, 10% growth in Branded Cards. And you can see how resilient the consumer is in US through the elevated payment rates and the low level of credit losses. They have, however, shifted their spend far more to travel and entertainment, which are now outpacing 2019 levels. While volatility can be an opportunity for our trading desks, lower asset prices are a headwind for Wealth Management. Asia again was hit harder than other regions leading to flat year-over-year Wealth Management revenues overall. That said, we continue to execute our wealth strategy across a number of fronts, including building our base of client advisors, expanding our Private Bank's physical footprint to reach 20 countries, with the additions of Germany and France, and increasing referrals from our branch network in the US. So, the underlying strategic drivers for the long-term growth of this business continue to advance. Overall, while we did have a slight build in reserves, given the increasing possibility of a recession, we are operating from a position of strength. Our capital, liquidity, credit quality, and reserve levels are strong, and our diversified business mix also positions us well for the choppy waters on the horizon. Well, while the world has changed since we presented our Investor Day to you in March, our strategy has not. We have continued to execute it with discipline and with urgency. The quarterly report card on slide 3 should help you hold us accountable for our progress. We are laser-focused on the long-termgoals we set out in March, and I see this quarter's performance as validating that we are indeed on the right path. Simplifying the firm is a high priority, and we made good progress executing on our divestitures such as closing the sale of Australia during the quarter. We are well into the sales process in Mexico, working through the regulatory and legal dynamics that can be expected in a transaction of this nature. In terms of Russia, we continue to shrink the size of our business and take steps to reduce our financial exposure. Given the complex environment, we are considering the full range of possibilities to exit our consumer and commercial banking businesses, including portfolio sales. As divestitures such as Australia progress, we are beginning to eliminate stranded costs and simplify our model, and this discipline is critical to ensuring we have the resources to invest in the businesses where we want to gain or maintain a competitive advantage and to ensure the success of our transformation. To that point, we were particularly pleased that our AML Consent Order was lifted by the OCC in April. We are committed to ensuring our technology, controls, and processes are up to the standards our regulators expect of us and we expect of ourselves. Let me end on capital. We increased our CET1 ratio to 11.9% this quarter, whilst returning $1.3 billion in capital, including a rather modest level of buybacks. Our tangible book value per share now exceeds $80. Despite the strength of our balance sheet and reserves, our stress capital buffer is set to increase to 4% in the fourth quarter as a result of this year's stress test scenario. So, over the near-term, we plan to build to a CET1 ratio of approximately 13%, including a 100 basis point management buffer. Over the medium term, our CET1 target remains at 11.5% to 12%. We are prioritizing our dividend and are pausing our share repurchases as we build capital. We have a management buffer which we can use to help ensure a smooth path to our required levels, and Mark will walk you through our approach in a few minutes. We will generate significant capital given our earnings power and the completion of pending divestitures. We know how important buybacks are to shareholder value creation, in particular when we are trading at these levels, and are committed to restarting them as soon as it is prudent to do so. We will make every effort to optimize our capital especially in businesses such as Markets so we balance the needs of our clients, our investors, and our regulators. Overall, in a challenging macro and geopolitical environment, our team delivered solid results, and the bank is in a very strong position to weather uncertain times whilst playing to our strengths. I'm confident about the path ahead, and I'm pleased with our early progress. Now, I'd like to turn it over to Mark, and then we'd be delighted, as always, to take your questions.","billion, , revenue, net income, liquidity, cet1",yes,Yes,cet1,No,,No,,Yes,stress test,No,,Yes,occ,No,,Yes,cet1 ratio
2022,Q2,Mark Mason,"Thank you, Jane and good morning everyone. I'm going to start with the firm-wide financial results focusing on year-over-year comparisons for the second quarter unless I indicate otherwise, then spend a little more time on expenses, capital, and Russia, and then turn to the results of each segment and end with 2022 guidance. On slide 4, we show financial results for the full firm. As Jane mentioned earlier, in the second quarter we reported net income of $4.5 billion, an EPS of $2.19, with an RoTCE of 11.2% on $19.6 billion of revenues. In the quarter, total revenues increased 11%, with growth in both net interest income as well as non-interest revenues. Net interest income grew 14% driven by higher rates as well as strong volumes across ICG and PBWM. Non- interest revenue grew 5% driven by Fixed Income and Services, which more than offset lower non-interest revenue in Investment Banking and PBWM. Total expenses of $12.4 billion increased 8%, largely driven by transformation, business-led investments, and volume-related expenses. On a year-to-date basis, expenses were up 12%, but excluding divestiture related impacts were up 9%, also driven by the factors I just mentioned. Cost of credit was $1.3 billion, driven by net credit losses of $850 million and an ACL build of approximately $400 million. At the end of the quarter, we had approximately $18.3 billion in total reserves, with a reserve-to-funded loan ratio of 2.44%, and are well capitalized with a CET1 ratio of 11.9%. On slide 5, we show an expense walk for the second quarter with the key underlying drivers. As I mentioned earlier, expenses increased by 8%. 3% of the increase was driven by transformation investments, with about two- thirds related to risks, controls, data, and the finance programs, and approximately 25% of the investments in those programs are related to technology. And as of today, we have over 9,000 people dedicated to the transformation. About 2% of the expense increase was driven by business-led investments as we continue to hire commercial and investment bankers as well as client advisors in Wealth. And we continue to invest in the client experience as well as front office onboarding and platforms. 2% was due to higher revenue and volume-related expenses largely in Markets and cards, and approximately 1% was driven by compensation as well as other risk and control investments, partially offset by productivity savings and the impact of foreign exchange translation. Across all these buckets, we continue to invest in technology, which is up 14% for the quarter. Before we move on from expenses, we wanted to provide some tangible examples of what we are working on regarding our transformation and some of the benefits we expect to see over time. The transformation is designed to improve our governance and processes, enhance our policies, and leverage technology to strengthen our controls. We've been actively investing in technology to improve automation and hiring people to stand up these efforts. To this end, we are enhancing our risk management processes and capabilities across a number of areas. For example, in Banking, we've gone live with a new platform and now begun to consolidate our 37 loan processing systems to one loan servicing platform. And we have continued to build out our infrastructure to enhance our stress testing capabilities across the firm, particularly useful in this market. Given the power and importance of data, we are redesigning our data governance and data organization, which will help us improve the timeliness and quality of our data. These foundational data-related changes will allow us to simplify and improve client onboarding and deepening, product development, as well as enhance our data analytics for every function. And we are streamlining our financial planning process to allow for multiple scenarios with greater frequency, including more agile capital planning. And we signed with a major software provider to begin a multiyear process of modernizing and moving our 16 ledger platforms deployed across 121 instances to one cloud-based ledger. And while we are in the early stages of these initiatives, we expect the efficiencies from these investments to be key in helping us meet our Investor Day commitments. On slide 6, we show net interest income, loans, and deposits. In the second quarter, net interest income increased by approximately $1.1 billion on a sequential basis, driven by higher rates, day count, growth in loans, as well as the impact of the European dividend season on our Markets business. On a year over-year basis, net interest income increased by approximately $1.5 billion, driven by higher interest rates as well as volumes across businesses, and we grew average loans by approximately 3% in ICG, mainly in trade finance, and 4% in PBWM. Legacy Franchises loans declined, largely driven by the reclassification of loans to held-for-sale. And sequentially, the gross yield on our loans increased by 35 basis points and the cost of our interest-bearing deposits increased by 20 basis points. On slide 7, we show our summary balance sheet and key capital and liquidity metrics. We maintained a very strong balance sheet. Of our $2.4 trillion of assets, about 22% or $531 billion are high-quality liquid assets, or HQLAs, and we maintained total liquidity resources of approximately $964 billion. Our end-of-period deposits increased by 1%, largely driven by TTS and Wealth. On a sequential basis, deposits decreased by 1%, including the impact of seasonality in Wealth. From an RWA perspective, we saw both advanced and standardized RWA come down both year-over-year and sequentially as we continued to optimize RWA. We ended the quarter with a standardized CET1 ratio of approximately 11.9% and standardized remains the binding requirement. And our tangible book value per share was $80.25, up 3%. On slide 8, we show a sequential CET1 ratio walk to provide more detail on the drivers this quarter and our goals over the next few quarters. First, we generated $4.3 billion of net income to common, which added 34 basis points. Second, we returned $1.3 billion in the form of dividends and buybacks, which drove a reduction of about 10 basis points. Third, the interest rate impact on AOCI through our investment portfolio drove a 12 basis point reduction. Fourth, the decrease in disallowed DTA drove a five basis point increase. And finally, the remainder was driven by a combination of our net RWA optimization efforts as well as a 12 basis point benefit from the closing of the Australia sale. The combination of our earnings generation, closing of divestitures, and continued RWA optimization efforts will be important tools as we manage towards our CET1 requirements. And our management buffer, which was designed to temporarily address volatility, will allow us to build gradually, while continuing to support our clients. Given all that, we do expect to build to a CET1 target of approximately 13% by midyear 2023, which accounts for the increased regulatory requirement and assumes a 100 basis point management buffer. However, consistent with what we said at Investor Day, our medium-term target remains at 11.5% to 12%. And while we are pausing buybacks for now, as I've said before, we remain committed to returning excess capital to our shareholders over time. On slide 9, we provide an update on our exposure to Russia. In 2Q, we reduced our exposure by $3.1 billion in local currency terms, which was more than offset by the ruble appreciation. As of today, the mix of our exposure has changed and is now reflecting a higher proportion of stronger credit names. Additionally, our net investment in our Russian entity is now approximately $1.2 billion, up from about $700 million due to the ruble appreciation. As a result of the actions that we've taken to reduce our risks, we now believe that under a range of severe stress scenarios, our potential capital impact is estimated to be approximately $2 billion, down from the $2.5 billion to $3 billion last quarter. On slide 10, we show the results for our Institutional Clients Group. Revenues increased by 20%, largely driven by TTS, Markets, Security Services, as well as a gain on loan hedges, partially offset by a decrease in Investment Banking revenues. Expenses increased 10%, driven by transformation, business-led investments, and volume- related expenses, partially offset by productivity savings. Cost of credit was a benefit of $202 million, with a net ACL release of $220 million and net credit losses of only $18 million. The release was largely driven by a reduction in Russia-related risks, partially offset by a build due to increased global macro uncertainty. This resulted in net income of approximately $4 billion, up 16%. We grew average loans by 3%, largely driven by TTS loans which were up 17%. Average deposits grew 1%, driven by the deepening of existing client relationships and new client acquisitions, and ICG delivered an RoTCE of 16.6%. On slide 11, we show revenue performance by business and the key drivers we laid out at Investor Day, which we will show you each quarter. In Services, we continue to see a very strong new client pipeline and deepening with our existing clients and expect that momentum to continue. In Treasury and Trade Solutions, revenues were up 33%, driven by 42% growth in net interest income as well as 17% growth in NIR, as we saw strong growth with both mid and large corporate clients, and we continue to see healthy underlying drivers in TTS that indicate continued strong client activity with US dollar clearing volumes up 2%, cross-border flows up 17%, and commercial card volumes up 61%. Again, these metrics are indicators of client activity and fees, and on a combined basis drive approximately 50% of total TTS fee revenue. Security Services revenues grew 16% as net interest income grew 41%, driven by higher interest rates across currencies. And NIR grew 8%, largely reflecting elevated activity levels in issuer services. Overall, Markets revenues were up 25%. The macro-environment played to our strengths, with the volatility leading to elevated corporate client activity. Fixed Income Markets revenues were up 31%, driven by FX, rates, and commodities due to active engagement with our corporate clients, as we helped them manage risk associated with volatile markets. Equity Markets revenues were up 8%, driven by strong equity derivative performance, partially offset by less client activity in cash and a net decrease in prime balances, as lower asset valuations more than offset new client balances. Banking revenues, excluding gains and losses on loan hedges, were down 28% driven by Investment Banking, as heightened geopolitical uncertainty and the overall macro backdrop impacted client activity, partially offset by higher revenue in Corporate Lending. So, we feel very good about the progress we are making here as we continue to deepen existing client relationships as well as acquire new clients. Now turning to slide 12, we show the results for our Personal Banking and Wealth Management businesses. Revenues were up 6%, as net interest income growth was partially offset by a decline in non interest revenue, largely driven by partner payments in Retail Services. Expenses were up 12%, driven by transformation, business-led investments, and higher volume-driven expenses partially offset by productivity savings. Cost of credit of $1.4 billion was up as we added reserves, given the increase in overall uncertainty in the macro environment compared to a net ACL release last year. And NCLs were down 19% as we continue to see strong credit performance across portfolios. Average loans grew 4%, driven by strong growth in Branded Cards as well as growth across Retail Services and Wealth. Average deposits grew 6%, driven by growth across Retail and Wealth. We continue to maintain a strong reserve-to-loan ratio of 7.5% in our US cards businesses, and PBWM delivered an RoTCE of 6.8%. While a low return, this was driven by the ACL build and an increase in expenses in the quarter. On slide 13, we show PBWM revenues by product as well as key business drivers and metrics. Branded Cards revenues were up 10%, driven by higher interest on higher loan balances. We are seeing encouraging underlying drivers with new accounts and card spend volumes, both up 18%, and average loans up 11%. Retail Services revenues were up 7%, also driven by higher interest on higher loan balances, partially offset by higher partner payments. So despite payment rates remaining elevated, the investments we have been making have driven growth in interest-earning balances of 3% in Branded Cards and 2% in Retail Services, and we believe we will continue to grow these balances in the second half of the year. Retail Banking revenues were up 6%, primarily driven by deposit spreads and volumes. Wealth revenues were flat as investment fee headwinds offset NII growth, driven by deposits and loan volumes. Excluding Asia, revenues were up 4%. We're starting to see the leading indicators pick up with average deposits up 7% and client advisors up 8%. And we are seeing strong new client acquisitions having added 800 Private Bank clients and over 50,000 Citigold clients since last year. On slide 14, we show results for Legacy Franchises. Revenues declined 15%, largely driven by the closing of the Australia consumer sale, the Korea wind-down, and muted investment activity in Asia. And as we mentioned, this quarter we closed the sale of the Australia consumer business, which was a benefit of up to $1.5 billion of capital. On slide 15, we show results for Corporate/Other. Revenues increased, largely driven by higher net revenue from the investment portfolio, and expenses were down. On slide 16, we briefly touch on the full year 2022 outlook. At this point, we continue to expect full-year revenues to be up in the low-single digit range. Relative to Investor Day, the rate curve is certainly giving us a tailwind from an NII perspective and Markets revenues are up for the first half of the year. However, as we mentioned earlier, we are seeing much lower levels of Investment Banking activity, and this will likely continue for the remainder of the year. In terms of expenses, we still expect to grow expenses by 7% to 8% excluding the impact of divestitures. While we are seeing some impact from inflation, we believe the efficiencies that we're executing against and the impact of foreign exchange translation should offset these headwinds. And with that, Jane and I would be happy to take your questions.","billion, , revenue, cet1, net income, liquidity, million, trillion, net interest income",yes,Yes,cet1,No,,No,,No,,Yes,regulatory requirement,No,,No,,Yes,cet1 ratio

2022,Q2,Donald,"Hi. Good morning. Mark, was hoping that maybe you could unpack the guidance for 2022 a little bit more. It seems like you've got more good guys than bad guys maintain the guidance, but maybe within that, could you give us a little bit more color on what you're expecting on net interest income, where the trend seems strong, and then maybe what you're assuming from Markets in the back half of the year? Thank you.",net interest income,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q2,Mark Mason,"Yeah, thank you, John. Good morning to you. As you said, we have seen the benefit certainly in the quarter here of the pickup in rates and certainly all indicators are that the rate increases will likely continue through the balance of the year. And as you've heard me say before, I do expect that we will see continued growth in loans, particularly on the card side, and we saw some of that start to play in sooner than expected, because I had talked about it being in the back half of the year. We saw some of that even here in the second quarter. So we do continue to think we'll get some lift there. We also expect to see continued momentum on the Services side, both in TTS and likely in Security Services as well. And that growth is more than just rates, but certainly a portion of that does come from rates as well. Where the pressure is going to come is in the non-interest revenue. And we saw that certainly in the quarter here on the Investment Banking side. We saw that obviously in some of the Wealth businesses, particularly in Asia, and that's where some of the offset is that we'd expect against that NII momentum. Now, the reality I think is that we'll have to see how this plays out as it relates to markets. All the uncertainty that's out there in the environment thus far has played to our favor, given our focus on corporate clients and what have you. But I'd tell you that as I look at the full year based on what we know now and with the uncertainty that's out there, I continue to feel comfortable with that guidance probably to the higher end of that low-single digit growth that I've talked about.

2022,Q2,Donald,...peers and relative to rates. Just remind us where you are on that and what kind of deposit pricing assumptions are embedded in that?,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q2,Mark Mason,"Sure. So, important to kind of just level set, John, great question. We got – I think there are a couple of drivers that kind of come into play when we think about the sensitivity. So, one is obviously the mix. And so, in our case we've got about two-thirds of our deposits are wholesale, about a third are consumer. We've got, obviously, 70% of ours are in US denominated and the rest are kind of non-US. And that mix is important when you think about betas, when you think about sensitivity and how they play out particularly in a rising rate environment at the pace that we've seen. And that pace varies for both the US versus the non-US currencies. And so, that's all going to be a factor in kind of how we think about it. You're right, in our disclosure, we forecast our IRE disclosure based on a run-off balance sheet assumption. And what I've been describing in the past couple of quarters is an approach that's more consistent with peers, which assumes a static balance sheet. And under that analysis, if we were to look at an assumption for 100 basis point parallel shift in rates, cross currencies, we think that would generate roughly a $2.5 billion increase in NII. Now, for us, that's going to skew towards non-US dollars. About 80% of that would be non-US dollar, about 20% US dollar. And that shift is in part because we've seen already a significant increase in the US. We've seen some increase in non-US, but nowhere near the magnitude that we've seen in the US. So I'll stop there. Hopefully that addresses your question.",billion,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q2,Operator,Thank you. Our next question will come from Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI. Your line is now open.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q2,Glenn Schorr,"Thanks very much. Mark, I wonder if you could just elaborate on the headwinds in non interest revenue within PBWM and Retail Services. It sounds to me like you extended a contract for a partner or something like that. And then maybe bigger picture, in cards, you just mentioned rising card loans. We all want rising loans, but in the backdrop and the economic outlook we're facing, how do you decipher what's good rise in card loans versus a little concerning rise in card loans?",revenue,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q2,Mark Mason,"Sure, let me take them in that order. So on the Retail Services side, it has nothing to do with kind of an extension of a contract or anything like that. What I'm describing is that it is a partner business that we have there in Retail Services. And what that means is that there's a sharing of the profits associated with the business that we generate. And so what happens is in this rising rate environment and the activity from a volume point of view, we've seen an increase in the net interest income that we've generated, and what that means is that there's more – fortunately, more profits to share with our partners. The sharing of those profits play through the non-interest revenue line. So it comes out as a fee, as a contra revenue, as we share those with clients. So that's the driver of the swing that you see happening there or the pressure that we have in PBWM as it relates to Retail Services. In terms of the cards growth, the cards growth we feel very good about it. There certainly is an environmental dynamic that's playing out as it relates to consumers and corporates. But what I would say is that you've also heard us describing more marketing spend, more advertising spend, more acquisitions, 18% growth in acquisitions. We've been targeting growing our customer base there, while staying within our risk appetite, and the parameters that we've set and been very disciplined about. And that's started to pay off. And that is part of what I'd describe in terms of the loan growth that is materializing. There's nothing that we see of significance as we grow these loans, that would suggest, one, that they're outside of the focus that we've had to-date, because they're not, nor that there's any material risk in terms of outsized losses. If you look at our loss rates, our loss rates are for Branded Cards 1.5%, Retail Services 2.6%. Those are 50% of what we would normally what we used to describe as a normal loss rate, NCL rate, through a cycle. And so, we feel very good about the loans that we're growing. There's obviously risk, but we also feel very good about the reserves that we have.","loan growth, revenue, net interest income",yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q2,Operator,Thank you. Our next question will come from Erika Najarian with UBS. Your line is now open.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q2,Erika Najarian,"Yes, hi. My first question is actually a follow-up to John's question, Mark. I think that, it's always been more challenging to forecast net interest income for Citigroup. And the net interest income and net interest margin certainly surprised to the upside. So, I guess, let me re-ask the question. Appreciate the $2.5 billion for each 100 basis point in parallel shift, but as we think about the US forward curve, how should we think about the trajectory of net interest income from that $10.58 billion from here? And clearly, as we think about a deposit base that's two-thirds wholesale, how should we think about both deposit flow, deposit growth, and deposit beta as we think about the second half of the year? In other words, does the rate of change quarter-over-quarter accelerate, flatten out, or decelerate?","billion, net interest income",no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,Yes,net interest margin
2022,Q2,Mark Mason,"Yeah, there's a lot there. But, I mean, I think what I'd say is a couple of things. One is, we've obviously seen a rapid increase in rates, and that the speed at which rates increases matters a lot as it relates to the betas, and so particularly on the wholesale corporate side. And so, we have seen betas increase there. They're probably at about to slightly a little bit better than we would have expected. But we would expect that momentum to continue in the back half of the year given the forecast for continued rate increases. The other thing that I'd point out just given your point around the ability to forecast from a Citi point of view, if you look at the first half of the year, we did about, I think it was $1.8 billion or so over the prior year, ex-Markets. So, NII ex-Markets, $1.8 billion year-over-year first half. To give you a bit more guidance on how we're thinking about it in light of the rate curve and in light of our mix, I'd tell you that I expect about another $1.8 billion or so in the back half. So that's probably year-over-year 8-ish percent or so on a full-year basis based on, again, our mix, our assumption around betas and our current assumptions around how the curve would likely play out. Let me pause there and see if Jane wants to add anything to that.",billion,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q2,Jane Fraser,"Yeah, I'd also add in, our institutional deposits account for about 65% of Citi's deposit base, but 55% of them are operational deposits. And the TTS deposits have increased by $134 billion since pre-COVID, but the operational deposits increased by $141 billion, and the non-operating decreased. So, with QT on the horizon, we'd certainly expect the amounts of deposits in the system to shrink. We anticipate this would primarily impact non-operating balances, and I think we feel very good about the stickiness of the deposit base we've got, and particularly internationally where these are operating accounts that are extremely sticky, frankly, in all environments.",billion,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q2,Mark Mason,Good point.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q2,Erika Najarian,"Thank you. And just my follow-up question is that was really an impressive capital build this quarter, particularly since it's been an issue with investors, and especially since the SCB came out. I think a piece that we may be missing as we think about the continued build to 13% is sort of what the CET1 benefit is from slide 19. So, similar to sort of the, I guess it was 12 basis points accreted from the Australia sale. Is there any way you could give us a range on, as the deal close for the Philippines, Thailand, Bahrain, Malaysia in the second half of the year, how that could boost your CET1 and get you closer to that 13% bogey?",cet1,no,Yes,cet1,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q2,Mark Mason,"Yeah, I guess let me kind of answer it in a more fulsome way, if you don't mind, and then I'll certainly make sure that I give you a sense for the contribution of what we expect from divestitures to the capital impact. So, again, there are a couple of drivers that are going to be important to us building to ultimately the 13% for as long as that is place given the SCB. One is obviously the income generation. And with a very strong quarter as it relates to income generation, I feel good about the back half of the year as I've just given you some guidance on. The other is, don't forget we've had 160 basis points on the two-year since the beginning of the year to the end of the first quarter in terms of rate increases, another 60 bps in the second quarter. And it's going to be – there were AOCI impacts from that, 34 bps in the first quarter, and as we point out here, another 12 bps in the second.There's a pull to par that we expect to start to play out and continue to play out in the balance of the year. That's going to be an important factor. The third, as you've heard us mention is, we've been working very hard to optimize our RWA and we'll continue to do that. We've paused the buybacks. That's a factor. And then as you mentioned, the divestitures, the close to $1.5 billion or so in Australia, I've talked about in the past about $4 billion for the year in terms of capital impact, I'm at about $3.5 billion with Australia is what I'm currently expecting. And so, a little bit less than what I had talked about before, in part because of some of the movement in terms of the timing of some of these closings. Still feel good about it. Just it's a difficult market that we're managing through. So that $3.5 billion total should give you a sense for how that translates into a CET1 impact that we're expecting, at least through the balance of this year, and obviously there'd be more to come as we continue to close out – and sign and close out some of the remaining deals.","billion, cet1",yes,Yes,cet1,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q2,Jane Fraser,"Yeah, I mean, I rather suspect that at the end of all of this, we're going to have an overabundance of capital. And I really feel good that Citi is already very well-positioned for any environment. And as Mark said, we have a confluence of various factors going on, I mean, some of which are temporary, that are causing this rapid buildup of capital for the industry. But I think we're extremely well-positioned for what lies ahead in terms of strong capital ratios, total liquidity resources. Portfolio credit quality is extremely high, well reserved. And so, we are very much looking forward to resuming share buybacks as I said once we've achieved this build, particularly given where we're trading, and I want you to hear loud and clear that commitment.",liquidity,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q2,Operator,Thank you. Our next question will come from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is now open.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q2,Mike Mayo,"Hi. I'm trying to figure out if you're lucky or smart. And the reason I say that is, at your Investor Day, I mean, right upfront you said you have five core interconnected businesses led by Services, led by TTS, and then a few months later you have your best quarter in a decade. And it just seems so coincidental that you highlight that as a growth area and then just a couple of quarters later, boom, here we are. So, how much of that TTS growth is simply because of one-off factors in the markets, in other words it won't repeat? How much of it is due to a higher baseline, because of, say, interest rates? And how much of that is due to market share gains? And just remind us what TTS and Security Services is again, because I think you got everyone's attention with this quarter?",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q2,Jane Fraser,"So, why don't I kick off and then I'll pass it to Mark. And it's a danger here of how long you have, Mike, because there's a lot to talk about. So I would encourage you to sit at the beach this weekend and have an excellent read of the supplement because we've provided you with a lot of good facts and proof points and information both around the Services businesses and the others about the early progress on the strategy. TTS was able to fire, as I said, on all cylinders this quarter. About two-thirds of the performance was driven by business actions and one-third was by rates. And as Mark said, very active management of the deposit base, beta discipline across all the regions, and the NIR growth that you saw was driven by cards, by payments, by receivables, and by trade. When you look in the strategic drivers we laid out at Investor Day this quarter, cross- border transaction value up 17% year-over-year, clearing volume up 2% in US dollar, commercial comp spend up 62% as that business recovered, average trade loan balances up 14%, average deposit balances up 2%. So that two-thirds that was not rates related has a very broad and substantive set of drivers behind it, that as Mark said, puts us into a very strong position for continued momentum here. This level of year-over-year growth is very pleasing. But we would expect to see it revert to the medium term guidance we gave you at Investor Day over time. But, no, this was across the board all elements firing. And I will give a shout out to Shahmir, the Head of TTS, as well as to our Security Services team. But he has really instituted a culture of intensity, of tremendous focus, of discipline in how he is running the business as well. And I think that is also a contributing factor to the confidence that you're hearing from us about this. Mark, do you want to explain what TTS and Security Services is?",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q2,Mark Mason,"Again, as you've heard us describe, the TTS franchise is core to our business. It provides obviously a network to the large multinational clients in over 90 countries. We manage the full swath of their working capital and cash management needs. We also provide trade financing for them and their vendors and partners. And this is essentially in many ways what differentiates our franchise from others. And not only is it in and of itself a core growing high-returning business, but it's one of the businesses that is well connected to the rest of the franchise when you think about the Markets business that we have and the FX that we manage on behalf of clients. And so – and this is a particularly relevant time for us to be engaged with those partners as they manage through supply chain issues and we're there to again help them work through those things and provide them alternatives to their production and operations, and similar type services we provide to our investor client base from a Security Services point of view. Look, the strategy here did not start with Investor Day. That is, we obviously spent time with you talking about that, but this has been a part of the franchise that we've been investing in on an ongoing basis, and it's important that we continue to do that. Investments in technology, investments in onboarding of new clients and the services we provide, in enhanced digital capabilities, in the operations, so all of those things. And some of that what you see here is those investments starting to pay off.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,

2022,Q2,Ken Usdin,"...follow-up on the RWA. When you talk about the premium of the $3.5 billion, and can you help us just discern between what is a numerator impact and what's the RWA impact of the sales that have been announced? And just as a related, just how far are you through the RWA optimization efforts, how much more could you really see doing there? Thank you.",billion,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q2,Mark Mason,"Yeah, so the – thank you. The $3.5 billion I referenced is all capital, so all numerator impact is what I'm describing. It's both the, you know, any premium that we get or impact gained from sale as well as the RWA that we have allocated as part of that business, and so that all kind of flows through from a numerator point of view. In the case of Australia, for example, that would include both the RWA that we had attributed to that business as well as the CTA impact coming back into capital. So, remember, we took a hit when we signed the deal associated with the CTA. I kept communicating that that would neutralize when the deal was closed. In fact, it did. And that contributes to the roughly $1.5 billion there. In terms of RWA optimization efforts, it's a continuous effort. We are constantly working through the balance sheet to make sure that it's allocated to clients who generate the highest prospect for growth and leverage the breadth of the franchise, and we're going to continue to do that. And I think the team did a very good job in ICG and particularly in Markets this quarter in making sure that we made progress against the revenue to RWA metric that they've been using, which is a proxy for returns. They worked very closely with clients to manage the recycling of trading inventory in a optimal way to optimize collateral positions and postings that we have to increase initial margins on derivative trading where that makes sense. And so, they've been actively working the balance sheet, and we're going to continue to do that. We want to be there to serve our clients, but we want to make sure that we are generating an appropriate return for the use of capital.","billion, revenue",yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q2,Jane Fraser,"And it's part of the shift that we've been instituting, Paco and Andy, in Markets and across ICG and across the firm in our commitment to our shareholders to be more returns focused and to be managing the business differently that way, and this is a very obvious example of that, because it's multi dimensional.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,

2022,Q2,Ebrahim Poonawala,"I guess just around capital, Mark, this is a two-part question. One, am I hearing you right that you're not going to leave the door open for buybacks until you get to 13%? Appreciating what Jane said about some of the transitory impact from AOCI, why not be a bit more opportunistic? And just tied to that, what's the risk that some of these deals get pushed out? I see slide 19 where you've extended the timeline for a few deals. Given just the macro backdrop, like, is that a real risk or do you feel pretty good about the updated timelines? Thank you.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q2,Mark Mason,"Yeah, sure. So, look, I mean, we are obviously going to take it quarter-by-quarter as it relates to buybacks and from a capital point of view. Again, without going through all of the things that reflect the environment that we're in, you can see the uncertainty that's out there. Obviously, the capital requirements with this SCB for the industry are higher. That's unfortunate. We feel as well the right amount of capital was in the industry already. We've got to manage through that. It's a reg requirement. We're going to do that. But we'll – SCB gives us the opportunity to take those decisions quarter-by quarter. We're pausing for now. And next year there will be another DFAST process, and there will be an SCB that comes out of that. And frankly we should have the strength of higher PPNR that we've been generating to help contribute to what that outcome looks like. So, we'll take that quarter-by-quarter. In terms of risk related to divestitures, again, we did highlight we're being very, very transparent with you all and with the world, and we do see some delays that we highlighted from our original schedule that's in the back of the presentation there, but we feel very good about getting to closure there, and it's not an if, it's a when, and we feel like we're on track with the schedule that we've highlighted for you.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,Yes,dfast,No,,No,,No,,No,

2022,Q2,Betsy Graseck,"So on slide 8, you do give the medium-term outlook here for what you see as your long-term goals for capital, the 11.5% to 12%. And so, implicit within that is an expectation that your reg minimums would fall to somewhere 200 basis points or so, and I get that the exits will be part of that. Is there a sense you can tell us, as you get more simplified, what the SCB benefit would be? I thought it was something like 25 basis points, but I must be off there.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q2,Mark Mason,"Look, I mean, the 11.5% to 12% is consistent with what we talked about at Investor Day. And the medium-term, as you know, Betsy, for us is three to five years. We've got a couple of things that we're working through, not the least of which are the divestitures. They will certainly contribute to that, but so will some of the other things that I've mentioned including utilization of the DTA, the AOCI pullback and things of that sort. The divestitures certainly will help from an SCB point of view, but I think the stronger performance that we're seeing will aid in that as well. And importantly, the mix change that we expect to come from executing on our strategy, a mix towards more sustainable, predictable earnings, earnings that are coming from some of the areas of growth that we demonstrated this quarter like TTS and Security Services, et cetera, et cetera. So, there's time there. There's obviously a management buffer component of that that I think is certainly an important factor and consideration as we evolve our mix, and then there's the GSIB score with not only a reduction in the divestitures that will impact peak-to-trough losses, there's also deposits that will go away with those and balance sheet evolution that will contribute to a reduction in the GSIB score as well.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,Yes,gsib,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q2,Jane Fraser,"Yeah, let me just underline a couple of points. When we built our strategy, it wasn't only to generate greater returns, but it was to lower our capital requirements over time as Mark said. And you can see how we're executing that both in terms of the shift in mix and the divestitures. Obviously, we don't control the regulatory capital framework, but we're not managing for short-term shifts in SCB. As you know, the banks experience considerable variability in the SCB each year. It's very much depending on the scenario chosen. So that's why we continue with our commitment and confidence around the medium-term.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,

2022,Q2,Steven Chubak,"So, I had a follow-up question for, arguably for Mark on NII. As the Fed continues down the path of balance sheet normalization, I just wanted to clarify whether that $1.8 billion increase in NII you cited for the back half assumes stable deposits or some QT-related attrition. And within ICG specifically, are there any insights you can share on what drove the increase in Markets NII and how that should traject just given the historical liability sensitivity within the Markets business?",billion,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q2,Mark Mason,"On the first point, when I think about the back half of the year and quantitative tightening, I do expect that we will see some continued deposit growth, as I mentioned earlier. The pressure from quantitative tightening I think will certainly play out over time. But again, our focus is on growing the operating deposits that we have with clients, and we think we've got good traction and ability to continue momentum with those operating deposits. And again, they put us in a position to really broaden the relationship with both those multi-national clients as well as with some of our commercial clients where we've been getting good growth and momentum from. So, yes, likely would be an impact across the industry, but we believe we can get some continued momentum particularly on the operating deposits that we have with clients. In terms of Markets NII, I mean, you've got the European dividend that plays out in the second quarter, so that obviously is a factor there. And again, I'd point you to – when we talk about Markets, I really like to talk about total revenues, because the nature of the security and the trading and the activity that we do there can have an impact on NII and NIR, and what really matters is the total revenues that we're driving and generating out of that franchise. And as you can see, we did 25% growth in Markets revenue year over-year. So a very good quarter for the Markets team for sure.",revenue,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,

2022,Q2,Connor,"Hi. Can you elaborate on your comment about why the Russia exposure is kind of less of a risk or it's a better mix than it was a few months ago? And then maybe related to that, quantify how much of the $8.4 billion is to subsidiaries of MNCs which does seem like it'd be much, much lower risk? Thank you.",billion,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q2,Mark Mason,"Sure. So, look, what we've been doing very actively since the beginning of the year and certainly in the quarter as well has been working – we've been working to bring down our exposure in Russia and specifically with the clients that we serve there. And so, that direct exposure in a local currency dollars, we brought down by some $900 million or so in the quarter. We brought down and reduced the cash and deposits that we have by another $1.7 billion or so, and then continued to bring down third-party related exposure by another $400 million, and that's been through working with clients to pay those exposures and loans down, and in some instances giving them incentives to do so and incentives to move their deposits out as well. So, very active engagement from the team as it relates to that. What's happened with that is the mix of the exposure that we have or that remains has skewed towards the higher-quality names and towards the global subsidiaries that we have in the country. And so, with that mix shift to better quality names and the reduction in exposure, that's allowed for us to take down the reserves that we had related to the direct exposure in the quarter. And so, that has been, I think, very good progress in terms of that reduction. It gets overshadowed a bit with the ruble impact, but we've made good progress and we're going to continue to actively do that. Approximately – Jane, do you want to jump in on that?","billion, million",yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q2,Jane Fraser,"Yeah, yeah, no, I was going to jump in in terms of just sort of overall, let's be very clear. We are systematically crunching down the size of our franchise. And as Mark says, the severe stress loss scenario is probably the best indicator of that, which is now roundabout the $2 billion, and materially reduced down. And we completely changed the nature of our exposure. Particularly when you think about today, most of our clients are multinationals, and many of the exposures there have parent guarantees against them, which is very helpful. What are we doing with them? Many of them, that we're helping them with their exit from the countries. And that obviously, as you can all appreciate, takes some time. So, for those that are able to exit swiftly, that's another factor that can help us reduce down our exposure presence and indeed our operations. There are also others, though, that it is harder. I think we've all seen how difficult it is to disconnect the Russian economy from the West in a couple of key sectors, in particular food and in particular energy. And as you can imagine, given the nature of our bank, we've been in the middle of some of those flows that are essential for the West and the multinationals that are supporting it. And so, you have a bit of a blended story here in terms of, yes, we're helping those that connects to exit, but we're also still playing the role that we have to and have been asked to in maintaining some of those flows. We anticipate that they will continue to reduce over time as the energy and food security issues get addressed. But it's a complex environment. And bottom line, you can hear us, we're pleased with how this has been managed by our teams.",billion,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,

2022,Q2,Gerard Cassidy,"Mark, can you share with us, both of you addressed in your opening remarks about the impact the market conditions had on Investment Banking and your peers have seen it as well. If the market conditions remain this way in the second half of the year and into 2023, just for Investment Banking, not Markets, your trading business, when do you guys have to take a sharper pencil to the expenses in that division, or do you just let it run?",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q2,Jane Fraser,"Maybe I kick off and then pass it over to Mark. Look, strategic advice is central to the vision to being the preeminent banking partner for multinational firms. We are continuing to strategically invest in talent and in the platform. You can expect us to continue doing so, with a particular focus on the tech, healthcare, and financial services sectors, because those are ones where it is a decade-long shift that we're going to see in their importance. And we've brought in some very strong bankers there. It obviously takes a few years to build share, build out the client relationships, and to see the full fruits of those investments. We're also focused on the broader opportunity by leveraging investments in commercial banking, I'm sure Mark will talk about that as well, and in Markets and the connectivity there. So I think you're going to see us take a strategic look at this and a long-term look rather than just a shooting from the hip on the expenses side, because we're building the firm for the long-term here. We'll certainly be incredibly disciplined around expenses. You've seen that with us this quarter. We've talked about what we'll do on expenses across the board in the firm as we become simpler in tackling stranded costs, our organization structure, et cetera. But we're very serious about the investments that we're making into some of the core talent in these areas, and you shouldn't be expecting us to make any significant material shifts right or left on this one. We're deadly serious. Mark?",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q2,Mark Mason,"Jane, I think that's well said. The only thing I would add is that the business is capital light and is high returning through the cycle, and so we see a lot of value there. We want to be prepared to ramp up when activity starts again, and as you've said, it's quite strategic for us. Since you kind of wound me up on the commercial banking activity, I have to jump at it. We had, as you know, Jane, a very strong quarter in commercial banking. When I look at the revenue momentum there, just kind of leveraging the breadth of the franchise, we're probably up 25% to 30% in revenues in that part of the business. And I know that's part of our – as you know, that's part of our core growth strategy that we talked about at Investor Day. So, good momentum in that part of the franchise as well.",revenue,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,

2022,Q2,Vivek Juneja,"Thank you. Jane, a question for you on Mexico. Given the comments of the Mexican President, would that limit the price that a buyer would be willing to pay, and what's your sort of minimum price that you're willing to accept? And what's Plan B if the prices being bid don't meet that hurdle?",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q2,Jane Fraser,"Oh, Vivek, I'm not going to answer your question. But I'll give you a few comments on Mexico nonetheless. So, we're pleased with the interest in our Mexican franchise based on the discussions with the buyers, and the franchise is performing well. It's more than maintaining its value. It's contributing nicely to our financial results. But it's still very early in this process. So when we have news for you, we will obviously convey that to you swiftly. But it's early days. And as you'd expect with a transaction of this nature, we need to work through a variety of regulatory and legal proceedings. We're actively doing so. We're working hard on separating our market-leading institutional franchise, which is a key part of our global network, taking the time necessary to do that the right way. And we have a variety of different options that we can always look at. But it's far too early in the process here to speculate, but so far so good.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q2,Operator,Thank you. Our next question will come from Andrew Lim with Société Générale. Your line is now open.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q2,Andrew Lim,"Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I guess I'd like to have a better view from you on your outlook on recession. It is difficult to reconcile how investors feel about recession. It is obviously quite negative, and seemingly a lot more negative than it was about a quarter ago. But when we look at you and at some of your peers, the delta on the recession outlook seems only a little bit worse than it was one quarter ago. So, I was just wondering how you think about recession, because some of the investors that we talk to, they look at the savings ratio, it's back to pre-pandemic levels. They look at mortgage affordability and it's really quite dire. And the perception they have is obviously perhaps inconsistent with the way you're looking at recession. So perhaps you can give us a bit of color as to how you're thinking about things.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q2,Jane Fraser,"Yeah, I'll kick it off, pass it to Mark. Look, as we've talked about, the current macro environment is kind of shaped by the three Rs; Russia, rates and recession. And it depends where in the world you are as to which one's prevailing. In the US, we're more concerned about rates than imminent recession. The consumer and the corporate are healthy. The labor market is exceedingly tight. We are increasingly concerned about the possibility of a recession next year. But I think what you're hearing from us quite loud and clear is that we think the economy is quite well-positioned to withstand it. Europe, different story, fragility of their energy supply to any further shocks makes it more vulnerable and it's kind of at the center of the storm. So we do believe that the continent is heading into a recession under the most likely scenario and could be as early as this fall. In Asia, concerns are largely focused around China and it's zero COVID policy. The economy is bouncing back, but you could have another wave that could be more problematic there. So, and you put all these different factors, it's a little bit depends where in the world that you are. When I think about Citi, look, we're prepared for a variety of scenarios. We are absolutely ready. We run stress tests all the time, given the unique set of risks facing the global economy right now. We have a set of playbooks honed over many years that can get instituted as necessary. And what matters for a bank heading into a recession: capital, liquidity, credit quality, and reserves. And we feel very good about all four of them. Very strong capital ratios, as you've seen, ending 2Q. Total liquidity resources just shy of $1 trillion. Over 80% of our corporate exposures are investment grade. Our consumer clients are heavily prime. And let's just talk a little bit about the ICG NCL this quarter. When you look at the numbers, it was $18 million only. The health of the corporate entering into the choppy waters is extremely strong. And we've got a very well reserve to funded loan ratio of 2.44%. So we have a lot of flexibility here. If we have a severe recession, I think you'll see certain actions taken and other ones being slower, but as a bank, we're ready for a whole variety of different scenarios. Mark?","trillion, liquidity, million",yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q2,Mark Mason,"Yeah, Jane, just to your point on reserves, just in the quarter, you saw we took a reserve build, that reserve build was in part driven by our view on the potential for some downside in light of everything that we're seeing and the concerns around recession. So, we did take a bit of a build from a CECL point of view on reserves. And as Jane mentioned, we feel very good about our reserves levels and the $18 billion that we have associated with our franchise.",billion,yes,No,,No,,Yes,reserve build,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q2,Jane Fraser,"Yeah, I think, the consumer, it's just an unusual situation to be entering into this choppy environment when you have a consumer with strong health and such a tight labor market. And I think that's where you hear so many of us not so much concerned about an imminent recession in the States.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q2,Operator,Thank you. Our next question will come from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is now open.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q2,Mike Mayo,"Hi. Before I had my beach reading, thank you for that, look, to regain investor credibility, you've mentioned meeting various proof points, and can you remind us which proof points you've met, but which proof points we should hold you accountable to looking ahead in the next quarter and year?",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q2,Jane Fraser,"Look, I think you hold us accountable for all the different proof points we laid out. We went through a very thoughtful process to come up with the different KPIs for the strategy, and those are transparently put into the materials. We're trying to make it as shareholder and investor-friendly as possible in that respect. And if you can see this quarter, the drivers exceeded expectations in some places. There were headwinds in others. We laid them out very clearly. You saw as we talked about Services, so I don't need to cover that one again. In Markets, we talked about optimizing RWA, driving the business for stronger capital productivity, also driving more of the alpha trade solution business, you see that. Personal banking returning to IEB, and revenue growth from customer acquisition and purchase sales being important metrics. Investment Banking, its progress on key hires that we've been making, that's obviously been a tough market to do so, but I've been pleased with the talent that we've brought in and delighted with the talent that we have. Wealth was more challenged with lockdowns in Asia understandably slowing some progress on client acquisitions and some of the key strategy drivers there, but synergies more disciplined, tighter processes reinforced by additional metrics on the scorecard. You'll be hearing us talking more and more about the delivery of those synergies. So, it's not really any different from exactly what we laid out on Investor Day, right? We've laid out a strategy we have a lot of conviction around. We've laid out the different metrics to hold us accountable to, and it should provide you a sense of progress along the way. And we've also talked about what we're doing to get this cultural change of accountability, of urgency, of intensity, and excellence, and we'll give you as many different indicators of where that's working well and where it's not as we go along.",revenue,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q2,Mark Mason,"If I could just add one thing to that, Jane, and that, Mike, I think you ought to keep in mind that this is a very strong quarter for us, we feel very good about it, but it's just a quarter.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q2,Jane Fraser,Yeah.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q2,Mark Mason,"Right? And we talked about at Investor Day a long-term strategy and we gave you a sense for medium-term targets. And those things are going to be things that you hold us accountable between now and then, right. And so, this is one quarter. We feel great about it. We're certainly glad that you're recognizing it. But there's a lot more wood to chop. We're making a lot of investments in the franchise that we know are going to pay dividends in the future. And we look forward to kind of talking through continued progress in these KPIs. It won't always be a straight line, but we remain confident that we're going to get there.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,

2022,Q2,Vivek Juneja,"Won't. Okay. Yeah, okay, won't. Hopefully this one you will. Mark, your 8% NII growth for full year, is there something in the second quarter that was unusually high that we should not carry forward? I'm just trying to reconcile that with the guide that you've given, because if we just take that forward, it would be above the 8%. So trying to reconcile what's the difference.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q2,Mark Mason,"Look, I mean, each of the quarters obviously have different dynamics, different rate moves, different levels of volume growth and what have you. And so, there's certainly different volume levels between quarter 1 and quarter 2. And I described kind of how rates would move between the quarters as well. And so to simplify it and because there is appropriate interest in how we think about it on an ex- Markets basis, I just gave you the annualization of the half and what it would mean for the full year. So, nothing that I would point out beyond what you would notice, which is differences in rates and volumes across the businesses. Operator: Thank you. There are no further questions at this time.

2023,Q2,Jane Fraser,"Thank you, Jenn, and good morning to everyone. first quarter, it was not without its moments. The global economy continues to be remarkedly resilient, although the macro backdrop differs across key markets. While the bulk of the tightening is behind us, central banks are responding vigorously to inflation In the U.S., the tight labor market keeps pushing the timing of this elusive recession later into this year or 2024, with the robust demand for services providing a backstop for the economy. The Eurozone has also exceeded expectations; however, most countries are facing pressure from labor and -term competitiveness. China is the biggest disappointment, as growth decelerated after an initial post-reopening pop. I was there year as some had hoped. So bottom line, globally we continue to see the same quite challenging macro-economic conditions that business model and strong balance sheet. We remain laser focused on executing our strategy and simplifying and modernizing our bank. Despite the turbulence and macro backdrop of the first half, we are on track with the plan we laid out at Investor Day and remained committed to our strategy and medium term ROTCE target. Today we reported net income of $2.9 billion and an EPS of $1.33. Our revenues ex-divestitures are relatively flat to last year and we remain on track to meet our revenue guidance of $78-79 billion for the year. We are also on track to meet the expense guidance for the year. And, consistent with the plan we shared with you at our Investor Day, we are pursuing cost saving opportunities to help offset the significant investments in our Transformation. In Services, TTS continues to deliver, with revenues up a healthy 15%. This was driven by both net interest income and non-interest revenue as we win fee-generating mandates with new clients and deepen our relationships with existing large corporate and commercial clients. We are proud of our number one ranking for large institutional clients1. And this week, we announced our latest innovation, Citi Direct Commercial Banking, a digital platform to help our growing commercial clients tap into our global network. Securities Services revenues were also up 15%, driven by higher interest rates across currencies. We are really pleased with execution in this business as we continue to bring in new assets under custody and administration, which are up by approximately $2.4 trillion in the last year. And we have gained 100 basis points in share year-over-year as a result of the investments we have been making2. Markets revenues were down 13%, compared to an exceptionally strong second quarter last year. From early April, clients stood on the sidelines as the debt ceiling played out and we continued to experience very low levels of volatility throughout the quarter. Despite this, our corporate client flows remained strong, and we achieved our medium-term revenue-to-RWA target again this quarter. In Banking, the momentum in investment grade debt has spread into other DCM products. But the long awaited rebound in Investment Banking has yet to materialize, and it was a disappointing quarter in terms of both the wallet and our own performance with Investment Banking revenues down 24%. We continue to right-size the business to the environment whilst making investments in selected areas such as Technology and Healthcare. In the U.S., taken together our cards businesses had double-digit revenue growth aided by customer engagement and the continued normalization in payment rates. In Branded Cards, spend is still strong in travel and entertainment, and acquisitions remain pretty healthy. This is a great franchise, and we have launched a raft of new innovations from transforming our ThankYou rewards platform to our enhanced value proposition for the premium card with our longtime partner, American Airlines. Credit normalization is happening faster in Retail Services, given the p say we are seeing a more cautious consumer but not necessarily a recessionary one. Wealth revenues were down 5% as the business continues to be negatively impacted by the deposit mix shift, particularly in the Private Bank, and by lower investment revenues. However, we have seen activity pick up a bit in Asia for two quarters with growing net new assets. Referrals from the U.S. retail bank are increasing, and globally, new client acquisition in the Private Bank and Wealth at Work has grown significantly on the back of our investments in our network of client advisors and bankers. Turning to expenses, they were elevated this quarter, as we expected. This includes the additional repositioning actions we took to right size certain businesses and functions in light of the current environment. Year-to-date, severance is about $450 million, including $200 million in the quarter. Separate to repositioning, we remain committed to bending our expense curve by the end of 2024 through three significant efforts. First, we continue to make investments in our Transformation and other risk and control initiatives which are necessary to modernize our infrastructure, automate our controls, as well as improve the client experience. As we said before, we will start to see the more material benefits of these investments over the 1 al revenues. Peer Group includes BAC, BARC, BNP, DB, HSBC, JPM, SG, SCB, and WFC. Institutional/ICG Client includes Corporates with Turnover >1.5bn and all Financial Institutions. 2 al revenues. Market . medium-term. Second, as part of our simplification efforts, we expect to close the sales of our remaining two Asia consumer franchises by year-end, and we plan to restart the exit process in Poland. As you can see on the slide, we made excellent progress this quarter in the consumer businesses we are winding down, aided by material asset sales, and we are now attacking stranded costs and closing out the TSAs in the markets we have already exited. You saw our determination to execute when we decided to IPO Banamex after exploring a sale. We should complete the process of separating the two businesses next year in preparation for the IPO and I am pleased with the progress on the ground we are about to begin acceptance testing on the new systems for the retained businesses. All this means that by year end, considering how far the divestures and winddowns have progressed, Legacy Franchises will have materially reduced its exposures and primarily be down to Mexico, Poland, Korea and the elimination of the remaining stranded costs. As such, as we move through the second half of the year, we will be in a position to focus on the third leg of bringing down our expense base through a leaner organizational model. Together, these three efforts are why we have confidence in saying that we will start to bend the curve on an absolute basis by the end of 2024 and continue to bring down expenses over the medium-term. Let me end with capital. Stress Capital Buffer. We have engaged in active dialogue with the Fed to better understand the differences between our model and theirs in terms of Non-Interest Revenue. And the industry awaits further clarity on capital requirements and importantly their implementation timing from the holistic review the Fed has undertaken and the expected Basel III Endgame NPR. There is still uncertainty as to what the final rules will be and we, like the rest of the industry, will need to work through the implications. The exit of fourteen international consumer markets, coupled with the results of our transformation investments and change in business mix, will help reduce our capital ratios. In addition, we have other levers to pull over time, such as capital allocation, DTA utilization, our GSIB score and our management buffer of 100 basis points. We are committed to returning capital to our shareholders, as you saw with our decisions to repurchase $1 billion in common stock and increase the dividend. We ended the second quarter with a CET 1 ratio at 13.3%, 100 basis points above our upcoming requirement, after returning a total of $2 billion in capital. And we grew our Tangible Book Value per share to $85.34. Given the environment, we will continue to look at our level of capital return on a quarter-to-quarter basis. Overall, we are pleased with the progress we have made but there remains a lot to do. We will continue to update you on the progress we are making every quarter. With that, I would like to turn it over to Mark and then we would be delighted, as always, to take your questions.","billion, , revenue, net income, million, trillion, net interest income",yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,Yes,gsib,No,,Yes,basel iii,No,
2023,Q2,Mark Mason,"Thanks, Jane and good morning everyone. I am going to start with the Firmwide financial results, focusing on year-over-year comparisons for the second quarter unless I indicate otherwise, and spend a little more time on expenses and capital. Then I will turn to the results of each segment. On slide 4, we show financial results for the full firm. In the second quarter, we reported net income of approximately $2.9 billion and an EPS of $1.33 and an RoTCE of 6.4% on $19.4 billion of revenues. Embedded in these results are after-tax divestiture-related impacts of approximately $(92) million. Excluding these items, EPS was $1.37 with an RoTCE of 6.6%. In the quarter, total revenues decreased by 1% both on a reported basis and excluding divestiture-related impacts, as strength across Services, U.S. Personal Banking and revenue from the investment portfolio, was more than offset by declines in Markets, Investment Banking and Wealth, as well as the revenue reduction from the closed exits and wind-downs. Our results include expenses of $13.6 billion, up 9% both on a reported basis and excluding divesture-related costs. Cost of credit was approximately $1.8 billion, primarily driven by the continued normalization in Cards net credit losses and ACL builds, largely related to growth in card balances. Our effective tax rate this quarter was 27%, primarily driven by the geographic mix of our pre-tax earnings in the quarter. Excluding current quarter divestiture-related impacts, our effective tax rate was 26%. At the end of the quarter, we had over $20 billion in total reserves with a reserve-to-funded loans ratio of approximately 2.7%. And through the first half of 2023, we reported an RoTCE of 8.7%. On Slide 5, we show the quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year expense variance for the second quarter. Expenses were up 9%, driven by a number of factors, including investments in risk and controls, business led and enterprise-led investments, volume growth and macro factors, including inflation, as well as severance, and all of this was partially offset by productivity savings and expense reductions from the exits and wind-downs Severance in the quarter was approximately $200 million, and $450 million year-to-date, as we took further actions across Investment Banking, Markets and the Functions. We are investing in the execution of our Transformation and continue to see a shift in our investments from third-party consulting to technology and full-time employees. And as we said last quarter, our Transformation and technology investments span across the following themes: Platform and process simplification, security and infrastructure modernization, client experience enhancements and data improvements. Despite the higher expense base sequentially, we remain in line with our full year guidance of roughly $54 billion, excluding divestiture-related impacts and the FDIC special assessment. riances. In the second quarter, net interest income increased by approximately $550 million, largely driven by dividends. The increase in net interest income ex-Markets was largely driven by higher rates and cards growth, partially offset by the mix shift that we have seen to higher rate deposit products within PBWM. Average loans were flat as growth in PBWM was offset by the wind-down markets and a decline in ICG, as we continue to optimize the loan portfolio including a further reduction in subscription credit facilities. Average deposits were down 2%, largely driven by TTS as we saw some non-operational outflow as expected in light of quantitative tightening. However, underlying this, we did see strong growth in operating accounts as we continue to win new clients and deepen with existing ones. And our net interest margin increased 7 basis points. On Slide 7, we show key consumer and corporate credit metrics. We are well reserved for the current environment with over $20 billion of total reserves. Our reserves-to-funded loans ratio is approximately 2.7%. And within that, U.S. Cards is 7.9%. In PBWM, 44% of our lending exposures are in US cards and of that exposure, 80% is to customers with FICOs of 680 or higher. And NCL rates are still below pre-COVID levels and are normalizing in line with our expectations. The remaining 56% of our PBWM lending exposure is largely in Wealth, predominantly in mortgages and margin lending. In our ICG portfolio, of our total exposure, approximately 85% is investment grade. Of the international exposure, approximately 90% is investment grade or exposure to multinational clients or their subsidiaries. And corporate non-accrual loans remain low at about 44 basis points of total loans. As you can see on the page, we break out our Commercial Real Estate lending exposures across ICG and PBWM which totals $66 billion, of which 90% is investment grade. So, while the macro and geopolitical environment remains uncertain, we feel very good about our asset quality, exposures and reserve levels and we continuously review and stress the portfolio under a range of scenarios. On Slide 8, we show our summary balance sheet and key capital and liquidity metrics. We maintain a very strong $2.4 trillion balance sheet which is funded in part by a well-diversified $1.3 trillion deposit base across regions, industries, customers and account types which is deployed into high-quality, diversified assets. Our balance sheet reflects our strategy and well diversified business model. We leverage our unique assets and capabilities to serve corporates, financial institutions, investors, and individuals with global needs. The majority of our deposits, $818 billion, are institutional and operational in nature and span across 90 countries. These institutional deposits are complemented by $427 billion of US Retail consumer and global wealth deposits as you can see on the bottom right side of the page. We have approximately $584 billion of HQLA and approximately $661 billion of loans and we maintain total liquidity resources of just under $1 trillion. Our LCR was relatively stable at 119% and our net stable funding ratio was greater than 100%. We ended the quarter with a 13.3% CET1 ratio. And our tangible book value per share was $85.34, up 6% from a year ago. On Slide 9, we show a sequential CET1 walk to provide more detail on the drivers this quarter. Starting from the end of the first quarter. First, we generated $2.6 billion of net income to common which added 22 basis points. Second, we returned $2.0 billion in the form of common dividends and share repurchases, which drove a reduction of about 18 basis points And finally, the remaining 14 basis point decrease was primarily driven by RWA growth as we continued to grow card balances, partially offset by optimizing RWA in Markets and Corporate Lending That said, our strategy is designed to further diversify our business mix to have a more consistent, predictable and repeatable revenue stream, as well as reduce risk and simplify our firm by exiting 14 international consumer markets. The strategy and the simplification coupled with the benefits of our transformation investments will allow us to improve RWA and capital over time. The continued optimization of our balance sheet should not only help SCB but reduce RWA. This will offset some of the anticipated headwinds in capital requirements and RWA. And we will continue to reassess how and where we deploy capital and evaluate the appropriate level of our management buffer over time. On Slide 10, we show the results for our Institutional Clients Group for the second quarter. Revenues were down 9% this quarter, as growth in Services was more than offset by Markets and Banking. Expenses increased 13%, primarily driven by continued investments in TTS and risk and controls, as well as approximately $120 million of severance in Investment Banking and Markets, partially offset by productivity savings. Cost of credit was $58 million, as net credit losses were partially offset by an ACL release. This resulted in net income of approximately $2.2 billion, down 45%, primarily driven by lower revenues and higher expenses. ICG delivered an RoTCE of 9.2% for the quarter and 11.4% through the first half of 2023. Average loans were down 6% reflecting discipline around our strategy and returns. Average deposits were up 1% as we continued to acquire new clients and deepen relationships with existing ones. On Slide 11, we show revenue performance by business and the key drivers we laid out at Investor Day. In Treasury and Trade Solutions, revenues were up 15%, driven by 18% growth in net interest income and 8% in non- -FX basis. We continue to see healthy underlying drivers in TTS that indicate consistently strong client activity with, U.S. Dollar Clearing Volumes up 6%, both in the quarter and through the first half of 2023, Cross-border flows up 11%, outpacing global GDP growth, both in the quarter and through the first half of 2023, and commercial card volumes up roughly 15%, led by spend in travel In fact, similar to the last few quarters, client wins are up approximately 41% across all client segments. These include marquee transactions where we are serving as In Securities Services, revenues were also up 15%, driven by higher net interest income across currencies. We are pleased with the progress in Securities Services as we continue to onboard assets under custody and administration, which are up approximately 11% or $2.4 trillion dollars And we feel very good about the pipeline of new deals in Securities Services As a reminder, the Services businesses are central to our strategy and are two of our higher-returning businesses with strong synergies across the firm. Markets revenues were down 13%, driven by both Fixed Income and Equities, relative to an exceptional quarter last year coupled with low volatility this quarter. Fixed Income revenues were down 13%, as strength in our Rates franchise was more than offset by a decline in Currencies and Commodities. Equities revenues were down 10%, primarily reflecting a decline in Equity Derivatives. But consistent with our strategy, we continued to grow Prime balances, driven by client wins. Corporate client flows remained strong and stable and we continued to make solid progress on our revenue-to-RWA target And finally, Banking revenues, excluding gains and losses on loan hedges, were down 22%, driven by Investment Banking, as heightened macro uncertainty continued to impact client activity, as well as lower revenues in Corporate Lending. While we continue to have a strong pipeline and are seeing green shoots of activity, we recognize there is more work to do in ECM and M&A. That said, we believe the investments we have made in Healthcare and Technology coverage will benefit us over time. So overall, while the market environment remains challenging and there is more work to be done, we are making progress against our strategy in ICG. Now turning to Slide 12, we show the results for our Personal Banking & Wealth Management business. Revenues were up 6%, driven by net interest income growth of 7%, partially offset by a 6% decline in non interest revenue, driven by lower investment product revenues in Wealth. Expenses were up 5%, predominantly driven by risk and control investments. Cost of credit was $1.6 billion, driven by higher net credit losses as we continue to see normalization in our card portfolios and a reserve build of $335 million, primarily driven by card balance growth. Average loans increased 7% driven by cards, mortgages and installment lending. Average deposits decreased 1%, largely reflecting our Wealth clients putting cash to work in fixed income investments on our platform. And PBWM delivered an RoTCE of 5.5%, both for this quarter and through the first half of 2023, largely reflecting the challenging environment for Wealth and higher credit costs. On Slide 13, we show PBWM revenues by product as well as key business drivers and metrics. Branded Cards revenues were up 8%, primarily driven by higher net interest income. We continue to see strong underlying drivers with new account acquisitions up 6%, card spend volumes up 4% and average loans up 14%. Retail Services revenues were up 27%, driven by higher net interest income and lower partner payments. For both Card portfolios, we continue to see payment rates decline, and that combined with the investments we have been making contributed to growth in interest-earning balances of 17% in Branded Cards and 12% in Retail Services. Retail Banking revenues decreased 9%, reflecting the transfer of relationships and the associated deposits to our Wealth business. In fact, consistent with our strategy, we continued to leverage our retail network to drive 25,000 Wealth referrals year-to-date through May, up 18% YoY. Wealth revenues were down 5%, driven by continued investment fee headwinds and higher deposit costs, particularly in the Private Bank. However, Wealth at Work revenues were up over 30%, driven by strong lending results, primarily in mortgages. Client advisors were down 1%, reflecting the re-pacing of strategic hiring. And new client acquisitions were up nearly 40% in the Private Bank and approximately 60% in Wealth-at momentum in underlying drivers. On Slide 14, we show results for Legacy Franchises. Revenues were down 1%, as the benefit of higher rates and volumes in Mexico was more than offset by the reductions from closed consumer exits and wind-downs. It is worth noting that -FX. Expenses decreased 2%, primarily driven by closed consumer exits and wind-downs. Excluding divestiture-related impacts, expenses decreased 8%. On Slide 15, we show results for Corporate Other for the second quarter. Revenues increased, largely driven by higher net revenue from the investment portfolio. Expenses also increased, driven by inflation and severance. maintaining our full-year revenue guidance of $78 - $79 billion, excluding 2023 divestiture-related impacts, although the mix has shifted somewhat. We are increasing our net interest income guidance from $45 billion to slightly above $46 billion for the full year excluding Markets, offset by lower non-interest revenue, largely driven by Investment Banking and Wealth. We are also maintaining our expense guidance of roughly $54 billion, excluding 2023 divestiture-related impacts and the FDIC special assessment. Net credit losses in Cards should continue to normalize in the remainder of the year, with both portfolios reaching normalized levels by year-end. And we now expect the full-year tax rate to be approximately 25%, excluding discrete items and divestiture-related impacts. As it relates to the third quarter, we expect continued momentum with clients, including fees, and benefits from US and non-US rates on NII. We also anticipate a sequential increase in expenses, driven by continued investments in Transformation and risk and controls. Net credit losses in Cards should continue to normalize in line with expectations. And our effective tax rate for the quarter should be approximately 25%, excluding discrete items and divestiture-related impacts. And as it relates to buybacks, we will continue to make that decision on a quarter-by-quarter basis. . We continue to execute on the strategy to simplify our firm, improve our revenue mix and bring both expenses and capital down over time. We are seeing solid momentum in the underlying drivers of the majority of our businesses. And as we said at Investor Day, the financial path will not be linear, but we remain focused on achieving our medium-term RoTCE target. And with that, Jane and I would be happy to take your questions.","billion, , revenue, cet1, net income, liquidity, million, trillion, net interest income",yes,Yes,cet1,Yes,"lcr, net stable funding ratio",Yes,reserve build,No,,No,,Yes,fdic,No,,Yes,"cet1 ratio, lcr, net interest margin"
2023,Q2,"Question And Answer
Operator",Our first question will come from Glenn Schorr with Evercore.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Glenn Schorr,"So, I'm very curious on the whole revenue to RWA topic, especially with some of the changes coming in. So maybe you could give a little more color on -- let's take, for instance, the further reduction in subscription credit facilities. I think I read somewhere that was like an $80 billion book down to $20 billion. You can correct that if that's wrong. But just usually, those things are big important clients that have relationship lending, things attached to them. So, I'm curious on how you balance the capital benefit, the clear capital benefit, versus client impact and how you think about that? Are there other blocks of business that are in motion right now?","billion, revenue",no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Mark Mason,"Thanks Glenn and good morning, and thanks for the question. Look, a couple of points on that. One is we've been very focused on the revenue to RWA metric in our Markets business in the ICG more broadly as well. And we've made considerable progress on that. And that's important because how we use the balance sheet and ensuring that we're optimizing the use of the balance sheet contributes to how we improve returns over time. You're right to point out the subscription facility, credit facility, lending that we do. We brought that down pretty significantly. The numbers you highlight are a lot higher than the portfolio. But what's important here is that as we look at that, we look at a couple of things. So, one, the nature of relationship and whether clients are taking advantage of the breadth of what we have to offer. Two, the profitability and returns associated with the product to the extent that it is in a broader relationship, and where those returns are low, subpar, and the prospect for doing more has proven to be fruitless, we take it down. And that's what we've done with a large part of that book, just as we juxtapose it against other opportunities to use balance sheet where clients are taking advantage of the broader franchise and therefore, are generating higher returns. And we're going to continue to do that. We've done that to drive the revenue to RWA metric. We've done it selectively on pieces of the portfolio like SCF. We've also looked at our broader corporate lending portfolio and where those promises for higher relationship returns aren't manifesting themselves, we've not renewed those loans. And as we think about pending regulatory changes, proactively making these efforts becomes critically important. When I look back on the activity that we've done over the past couple of years, we've reduced RWA by approximately $120 billion over the last 2 years, and about 75% of that is predominantly driven by balance sheet optimization and looking at client activity that has low margin business. And so,this is important for us to do and to keep doing.","billion, revenue",yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Glenn Schorr,"I appreciate that, Mark. Maybe just a quick follow-up. On NII, I asked this last quarter too. And your first half annualized ex-Markets is running about $1.5 billion ahead of the guide. Is that just unpredictable nature all the moving parts, trying to be conservative or anything else in the back half that you're thinking about?",billion,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Mark Mason,"Thanks, Glenn. We did take guidance up to slightly above $46 billion from the $45 billion. I guess there are a couple of things ex-Markets, of course. There are a couple of things to think about in terms of headwinds and tailwinds that play through there. One is you've heard me mention before that we've reached terminal betas in the U.S. Two, deposit volumes and the shift mix as we see consumers kind of move into higher-returning type, higher-yielding type products. And three, really the wind-downs and the exits and the reduction that they will play out in terms of NII. So those are kind of 3 headwinds as we think about the forecast and the balance of year. There are obviously some potential tailwinds that play to the other side, including rate movements in non-U.S. dollar as well as Card volume growth. And as we look at those headwinds and tailwinds, our current read is to take it up, but $46 billion or slightly above that feels like the right level in the context of total revenues at $78 billion to $79 billion.",billion,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Operator,And our next question comes from Jim Mitchell with Seaport Global Securities.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Jim Mitchell,"Maybe just getting on the expense side. You're keeping Mexico until 2025 now at the earliest. So that will be on the books longer. How do we think about that bend the curve discussion? And maybe specifically, you can help us think about bending the curve for the non-legacy businesses. Do we start to see is the fourth quarter just a slowing or quarterly decline? Is it a year-over-year kind of a discussion? I just want to make sure I understand the whole bend the curve notion and how to think about that.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Mark Mason,"Thank you. Let me take that. I'd say a couple of things. So, one, I'd reiterate the expense guidance that we've given for the full year. So that's the roughly $54 billion ex-divestitures, or the impact of divestitures, ex-any impact from FDIC special assessment. Two, as we think about bending the curve, I look into 2024 and we're looking to bring the absolute expense dollars down from Q3 to Q4. So that bending of the curve will occur. It will occur despite having Mexico still part of the franchise. And obviously still having Mexico impacts the magnitude of the bend, but it will bend Q3 to Q4. And then beyond that and through the medium term, we will see the curve continue to bend. Again, Mexico impacts the magnitude of the bend, but we're very, very focused on bringing our costs down and bending that curve. And you've heard us reference the aspects or the elements of our business that help contribute to that, not the least of which are the exits, one of which is Mexico, and you referenced the timing there, but also the benefits from investments that we've been making in transformation and risk controls and shifting from manual processes to technology-enabled ones. And then the final one is around simplifying our organization. And you heard in Jane's prepared remarks, as we continue to make progress on these exits, it opens up the opportunity for us to lean more heavily into that simplification. So, we are focused on not only the guidance, but the bending of the curve as you point out and looking forward to delivering that and taking actions to ensure we do.",billion,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,Yes,fdic,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Jim Mitchell,"So just as a follow-up, is the way to think about sort of 2025 and beyond as you get through a lot the automation on the sort of the non-legacy businesses and start to get much more efficient there. Is there an absolute expense decline story in the core business? Or is that more that you need the top line growth to get the improved returns?",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Mark Mason,"Again, it's going to be a combination of continuing to bend the curve and bring our expenses down. Obviously, we've given you guidance on operating efficiency of less than 60%, which will be some of that top line growth, but it's the combination of the two.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Operator,And our next question comes from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Betsy Graseck,"I just wanted to confirm on the CET1. You know you have the 100-basis point buffer on top of regulatory minimums. So that would suggest that the 13.3% that you got this quarter is in-line with where you're planning on holding it going forward, is that fair?",cet1,no,Yes,cet1,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Mark Mason,"So, you're right, we hit 13.3% this quarter, down a tad bit from the 13.4% last quarter. Effective October 1, the 4.3% SCB comes into play. And so that would equate to, assuming the 100-basis point management buffer, a 12.3% regulatory requirement and a 13.3% kind of target that we would manage to. I'd highlight a couple of things that I'm sure are obvious to you, Betsy. One is this is the stress capital buffer for the 12-month period starting October 1. And two is the strategy that we've described and talked about and have started to execute against is intentionally designed to help morph the business towards a more steady, predictable, consistent stream of revenues, fee revenue growth as well bring our expenses down over time, and exit these markets, and those things should contribute to reducing our stress capital buffer over time and improving our returns. But the answer to your question very directly is, yes, the 13.3% would reflect where we'd be targeting as of October 1 for now.",revenue,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,Yes,regulatory requirement,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Betsy Graseck,"And since you mentioned you're evaluating buybacks quarter-by-quarter. I guess the question here is, how should I think about that relative to, we get Basel endgame coming out soon because clearly, when you re at 13.3% against the new reg cap SCB, you know it signals a bigger opportunity for buybacks over the coming quarters. So how should I think about that?",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Jane Fraser,"I think that consistent with what we've been talking about, there's a lot of uncertainty out there about the new capital requirements, both in terms of the nature of them and the timing of implementation. I think the industry is expecting to get more clarity about that with the comment period that will be coming up. Plus, it's a fairly uncertain macroeconomic environment at the moment, so both Mark and I feel it's prudent to continue making that assessment until some of this uncertainty is clarified as to what precisely do. You should take confidence that we're at the levels, including the management buffer that we expect to be for the rest of the year. We've proven a good case of being able to build capital that's for sure over the last 2 years. And you take comfort as well we increased the dividend, we had $2 billion of capital returned last quarter, so our intentions are clear to return capital where we can, but also to be prudent in how we do so, given environment and current regulatory uncertainty.",billion,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Operator,Our next question comes from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Mike Mayo,"One negative question, one positive question. So, on the negative side, you talked about bending the cost curve, but I think second quarter year-over-year, it's bending the wrong way, and 6 quarters from now, you're saying it should bend the other way. So, what are we not seeing in the financials that gives you such confidence? Because it seems, based on this quarter's results, a little bit more of a trust me story. And on the positive side, TTS, continued double-digit growth, you continue to invest more in that business, how are you monetizing greater money in motion among your multinational and other clients?",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Jane Fraser,"Thanks Mike, I'll kick it off and then send it back to Mark. In terms of the expense side, I think we've been very transparent about the arc of our investment spend related both to the transformation and beyond. We'll continue to give you that transparency, Mike. Note last year, we hit our expense guidance. This year, we're on track for the guidance of roughly the $54 billion, ex-FDIC and divestitures and looking forward, we continue to guide what are the 3 levers that will drive the reduction in the expense curve starting at the end of '24. It's from exits and I think you've got a clear sense around the progress that we have been making on the divestitures. And therefore, we're pivoting, as we talked about, to focus now on really tackling the stranded expenses as we close off the final couple of sales there in Asia in the next few months. We'll realize the benefits from our investments in transformation and controls over the medium term. We'll also have the benefit of the remediation work getting done and expenses going away from that. And then the third one will be simplifying the organization, as we talked about. So, we'll continue to walk you, step by step, what are the different actions we're taking, what are we doing, and hopefully we are building up that track record of doing what we will say we are going to do every quarter. Mark, anything to add?",billion,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,Yes,fdic,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Mark Mason,"n the expense side, and then you may want to touch on the TTS, but the only add on the expense side is, we are taking repositioning charges, Mike. I mean we're not sitting still as we go through this uncertain period of time where wallets across certain parts of the industry are under significant pressure. And in taking those repositioning charges, there are going to be expense reductions that ultimately play out over the next 12-month period. So that's the other factor in addition to what Jane mentioned in the way of exits and benefits from the transformation that will play into the cost base over the next 12 months.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Jane Fraser,"And then on TTS, I think we all share your enthusiasm for this business in terms of the growth potential that we've been realizing and expect to continue, albeit converging now to the medium-term guidance over the next few quarters where we see it's a high to medium single-digit growth going forward. It's a very high-returning business and some of the indicators of how we're monetizing those relationships. We're seeing it both in terms of new client wins, they were up 41% this quarter. We have a sustained win-loss ratio of 80% on the new deals across different client segments. We're also seeing growth that's starting to really kick in from our commercial bank and the expansion of clients in the middle market around the world as we grow out that franchise. And we've got some very good fee-growth, which as Mark points out, and I point out all the time, we're very focused around, so cross-border up 11% U.S. dollar clearing up 6%, commercial cards up 15%, etc.. And we continue to invest in the business as well, so to make sure that 80%-win ratio continues. So, first bank to launch 24/7, 365 dollar clearing, U.S. dollar clearing. We've got the instant payments platform we just launched for e-commerce clients. We have Payments Express that is now live in the U.S., on track for 5 markets by the year-end. So, it's a story of innovation investment, it's got great returns. It's a good growth story, and it just, it keeps on going. And I don't want to diminish Securities Services in there either. It's another business that's, similarly, continuing to see significant client wins, up 65% versus last year as well. And a lot of our strategy there has been focused on gaining share with the asset managers in North America. Couple of years ago, we're down at 2.6% share. We're up about 4.3%. Our target is about 5.5% there in 2025 in that key growth area. I know there's a lot to like here too.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Operator,And our next question comes from Erika Najarian with UBS.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Erika Najarian,"So, I apologize having to ask the expense question again, but I think it's just very important because there's really two potential long-only investment thesis on Citi, right? One is the buyback given your tangible book values at $85 and the and the stock at $46 other is the spending the curve on expenses. So let me just ask Jim's question another way. In looking back to 2017, and I'm just looking at 2017 because I can break out legacy and core that way. And fast forward to 2022, you produced revenues ex Legacy Franchises about $61 billion in 2017 and about $67 billion in 2022. The associated expenses, again, without Legacy Franchises was about $34.5 billion in billion in 2017 versus $43.5 billion 2022, so you're surpassing the revenue uplift during that period by $3 billion. I guess the question is, you have so much certainty about the timing of this expense and I'm wondering how much of this $9 billion can go away? We understand that there's a lot of opportunity for reinvestment in the core business, but I think all of us are struggling to really understand that magnitude. And I think that the investor base in the market fully understands the Legacy Franchise story and how the exits will take time. But I think they're most interested in the core business and how much of that can come out.",", revenue, billion",no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Mark Mason,"Yes, sure. Look, no need to apologize for asking the question again, it's an important topic. I'd say a couple of things. So, one is that we can certainly look back in time, but I would highlight that we're here because we needed to have invested more in our franchise. And so undoubtedly, there's going to be an increase in our expense base that reflects the underinvestment from the past and in shoring up safety and soundness and actually moving towards a more automated operational, more modernized operations and infrastructure. So, there's certainly going to be that. With that said, with those investments come efficiencies. So, with the move from manual to automation over time, those types of investments will yield benefits in our cost structure. And that's part of what is going to bend the curve over that medium-term period. The other thing that I'd highlight is, obviously, with the Legacy Franchises, there's $7 billion of expense associated with those, and that will come down. But because of the Mexico transaction, we're going to be stuck with that a little bit longer given the IPO process. It doesn't put a big dent in our ability to bring stranded costs down and by the way, it does come with top line revenues and historically has been accretive to our profitability and returns. And so, I'm not going to give you kind of new guidance on where our expenses will end up. But what I will point you to is not only the $54 billion this year, roughly $54 billion this year, not only the bending of the curve in the third and fourth quarter or the third to the fourth quarter next year. But we've given guidance on top line growth, revenue of 5% call it CAGR through that medium-term period, and we've given you kind of operating efficiency targets that we've said as well, and we intend to deliver on those things that reflect the bending of that curve through all of those drivers that we've mentioned. So, I hope that helps, Erika. I appreciate the focus on both capital and expenses. We are equally focused on it and know just how important it is to achieving those targets. We're not only kind of doing the things that we've highlighted in that strategy articulation, but we're also being responsive to the current environment that we're in. We think that aids in our ability to deliver the targets and the bending of the curve, and we know there's an additional opportunity that Jane has referenced to the simplification of the organization as we make -- what I would argue is considerable progress on the exits towards the end of this year. And all of those things will be important to ensuring we get to that lower cost base, which we will do.","billion, revenue",yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,

2023,Q2,Erika Najarian,"And just a follow-up on that. I guess, you guys have been you guys have been pretty clear on the timing, and pretty clear on why the curve will bend. I guess I'm wondering, is it just a timing issue that you're not giving us the sort of the dollar numbers that could go away from the transformation? Is it just a timing issue? Or are you still at a point where you don't know how much of that you would need to reinvest to arrive at that 5% revenue CAGR?",revenue,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Mark Mason,"Sorry, your question was around expenses or the revenue?",revenue,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Erika Najarian,"Expenses. So, we get loud and clear why the curve will bend. We get loud and clear when the curve will bend, right? And there's clearly just expenses there that are catch-up expenses that are transformational expenses to everything that Jane talked about. And that message has been loud and clear. And I'm wondering if you haven't told us what could come out of those expenses because it's just a timing issue, it's July 14th versus 4Q'24? Or have you not yet made decisions in terms of how you may allocate those expenses in terms of do you need some of those expenses that could come out to grow your revenue base to that 5% CAGR versus having it fall to the bottom line? Sorry, that's the question.",revenue,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Mark Mason,"Yes. So, I'd say a couple of things. So, one, Erika, is obviously, with that revenue CAGR will be volume-related expenses that play out. But we're also focused, obviously, on the non-volume-related expenses and not giving you a precise number because the magnitude of that bend, right, is a factor, right? So obviously, Mexico, for example, as I mentioned earlier, impacts the magnitude of the bend, right? And we're going to, and have, in fact, when you look at our expense base even for the quarter, we've spent money in Mexico to drive that top line 22% revenue growth, 10% ex-FX. And so, there are going to be nuances in the running of the business in a way that ensures we're maximizing shareholder value that impacts the magnitude of the bending of that that expense curve. Investments that I got to continue to make in in TTS order to maintain that #1 position and that that competitive advantage we have. And so those things will impact that magnitude of the bend. We've been, I think, very transparent as we get into each year, giving you concrete numbers. What I'm telling you is the curve will bend. And as we get closer to 2024, we'll give you more direction on the magnitude for that year and beyond.",revenue,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,

The core drivers of how we get there remains unchanged. One, it's the revenues that we expect to grow by 4% to 5% CAGR as we continue to execute on the strategy. On expenses, it's the clear path to bend the curve by the end 2024, bringing those expenses down over the medium term. And third and importantly, it's continuing to optimize our balance sheet, including improving RWA and capital efficiency. And as we referenced earlier in the prepared remarks, different drivers in that, that are helpful, exiting 14 international consumer markets, changing our business mix. And I'd also note that the transformation has benefits not only for our efficiency, but it will also support RWA and capital optimization. That said, there's uncertainty around the future capital requirements in the industry and importantly, the timing of their implementation. We like everyone again to have to work through those implications once we know what they are. But as we said, keep in mind, we've got some other levers to pull over time, capital allocation, DTA allocation and utilization, our G-SIB score and our management buffer of 100 basis points. So that's where you hear the confidence from us around the path to executing and that remaining consistent. But Mark, why don't I hand over to you just around consumer market sales and operational RWA relief.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Mark Mason,"Sure. And again, I think that if you look at the transactions that we've closed to date, they've generated or freed up about $4.6 billion of capital the two that remain to be closed and the balance of year will generate another $1.2 billion or so. That will be important to our capital base. I think that we obviously have to see the proposal as it comes out and the NPR. And we'll have a window to respond to that. We're hopeful that the regulators hear our response and views on it as it comes out. There's clearly going to be reference to increases in RWA and operational risk implications potentially as part of that. I do think that exiting, without having seen the proposal, and without obviously knowing how those rules might evolve. I do believe that the exiting of these 14 markets does play towards not only reducing our SCB in stress scenarios or as it comes out of stress analysis and tests, but also should play through helping to reduce risk-weighted assets and potentially operational risk as well. But we have to see what the proposal looks like and go through that. And I think what's important here is that whenever it comes out, whatever it looks like, as we dissect it and go through it, we'll figure out how to manage through it, right, whether that be through exiting certain products, seeking price adjustments as it relates to customers, clients and the markets or continuing to optimize RWAs and we have been doing very proactively, we'll figure out how to manage.","billion, risk-weighted assets",yes,Yes,risk-weighted assets,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Jane Fraser,"And I feel compelled to jump in here as well because as the spring and the recent test results showed the large U.S. banks are not only in a strong capital position, but we've been able to play an important stabilizing role for the system as a whole. It's a role that we take very seriously. And we certainly hope that as the details of the capital frameworks get unveiled, this is fully taken into consideration, including the impact on U.S. competitiveness, and we need a level playing field with Europe, not a gold-plated one, and we share the concern that higher capital levels will undoubtedly increase the cost of capital for medium- and smaller sized enterprises and consumers in particular and will drive more activity to non-regulated and lesser capitalized players that isn't in the system's interest. And we hope that that's fully taken into consideration here because we will take actions on businesses, and we will take pricing actions as will the entire industry.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Mark Mason,Really important point.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Steven Chubak,"Thanks for that perspective, Jane, very well said. Just one quick follow-up for me. PBWM fee income trends, given the lower partner payments, I mean clearly the Wealth fee trends would suggest that they were quite subdued in the quarter. And I just wanted to understand your outlook over the near medium term what drove some of the weakness this quarter? Is it something that you expect will likely persist, especially given some of the market tailwinds that we've been seeing, would have expected to see a little bit more resiliency in Wealth fee income in particular.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Mark Mason,"Yes. Look, I think as we mentioned, Wealth was down about 5%. It's really hard to talk the rebound in Wealth in the midst of such an uncertain environment and the one that we're in, it's hard to disconnect those macro factors like rates, inflation, the prospect of a recession from what we're seeing in Wealth. And I think there are two dynamics that have played out. One has been the shift from our customers, from customers more broadly into higher-yielding products from out of deposits. And the other has been the fee revenue from an investment management fee point of view, and as you might think about it, it is a higher rate environment. There are opportunities for clients to earn more. And not until there's greater certainty in the broader macro factors will I think we start to see some real momentum tick up there. Now with that said, and a couple of things worth reiterating, which is we're seeing very strong referral momentum from the Retail Banking business up through wealth continuum, if you will. So, we've had about 25,000 referrals May year-to-date from our retail branches into our broader Wealth business, that's a good thing. We've seen the number of clients that we've onboarded tick up pretty meaningfully, both in the Private Bank and more broadly across Wealth. That's a good thing. Those are things that that position us well for when greater certainty does play out and these clients start to put monies back to work in the broader investment platform and offering that we have.",revenue,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Operator,And our next question comes from Ebrahim Poonawala with Bank of America.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Ebrahim Poonawala,"Just one quick question, Mark, for you. On the consumer cards book, you gave some metrics. One, remind us of what you reserved for in terms of unemployment rate, macro, and if we do see a worsening in the markets, does that necessarily mean that we'll see big ratcheting up of credit reserves from where you already are? Just some color around that would be helpful.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Mark Mason,"Sorry, just the last part of your question, I'm sorry, if we do see what?",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Ebrahim Poonawala,"Yes. So, one, like where are you in terms of your unemployment rate assumption? And if the unemployment outlook worsens, let's say, over the next 6 to 12 months, does that mean that you are already reserved? Or will we see another big pickup in provisioning as a result of that?",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Mark Mason,"Got it. Thank you. Look, our current reserves, as you know, as we think about CECL, we've got 3 different scenarios, we've got a base case in upside, a downside. Our current reserves are based on the mix of those 3 macroeconomic scenarios. It reflects about a 5.1% unemployment rate on a weighted basis over the 8 quarters, and it's roughly flat to what it was last quarter. What that means is, obviously, our downside scenario has unemployment that's much higher than that, closer to 7% or call it 6.8% or so. But that's kind of how we've thought about unemployment. As we think about the reserves each quarter, obviously, we take a look at the macroeconomic factors and how they're evolving. Our base case today assumes a mild recession and reserves in the future will consider how are weighting towards downside, upside and baseline may morph subject to our outlook and volumes. Those are the 2 factors that influence whether we're increasing reserves or not. I would point out though that in addition to unemployment and because has been as stubborn as it has been, if you will, we also look at debt service coverage ratio as an important factor as we think about our consumers, as we think about their balance sheet, as we think about the risk that they may or may not be facing. So unemployment is an important factor, but we've flexed our thinking in light of the environment and in light of how behaviors have been shifting, and that's an important factor in how we think about our reserves as well. I feel very good about the level of our reserves. You heard us mention earlier, we've got $20 billion of reserves, we're well reserved across the portfolio, but those are all important elements to it.",billion,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Ebrahim Poonawala,"That's helpful. And just one very simplistic question. When you talk to some of your largest shareholders, those who are optimistic think you can hit your RoTCE target medium term by 2025. Is that a realistic expectation given I appreciate Basel changes, you answered like 10 questions on expenses. But should we expect the groundwork through '24 that we hit that medium-term target in w25 or just your degree of confidence.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Mark Mason,"Yes. Again, the thing I'd point out and Jane, feel free to chime in here, is that what we talked about was getting to our medium-term returns, 11% to 12% and the medium term is 25 to 26, right? So it's not just 25, just to be clear. And we do continue to feel very confident around our ability to do that. You heard us mention the levers that we think will contribute to that. Obviously, capital is important and how that evolves, and we continue to kind of work to optimize the balance sheet while serving our clients effectively and importantly, growing the strong businesses that we have that are high returning as well.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Operator,"And our next question comes from Matt O'Connor from Deutsche Bank. You have mentioned continued normalization of credit card in the back half of the year. And just wondering, you've got the normalized loss rates on Slide 22. Are you still thinking you'll hit those, I think, exiting this year or early next year. And then I think at one point, you said they might go a little bit above that before they kind of come back to a normal level? And is that still the case?",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Mark Mason,"Thanks for the question. The answer is yes. We still expect for both portfolios to hit those normal levels sometime at the end of the year, the normal level, as you pointed out, on the page for both Branded as well as for Retail Services. We would expect, again, subject to how and when this mild recession kind of plays out, we would expect that they would tick higher than that before getting back inside of that range. But again, all of this is tied into how we've calculated our reserves, the delinquencies that we're seeing, the mix of the portfolio, which again skews towards your higher FICO scores and the customer behaviors that we're seeing, which play through not only that cost of credit line, but also plays through the growth that we referenced earlier in the top line. But short answer is yes, that's still our thinking.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Jane Fraser,"And as Mark said, I think we feel good about our positioning as a prime, but also a strong credit proposition that we have. We're seeing stronger demand for the credit-led products such as value cards, bulk on installment loans as well the service-led engagement for the more prime customers. And so that's also going to be a valuable factor driving growth and profitability as well. And then the follow-up, and this is not really Citi-specific, but for the card industry, a lot of the banks that are in card. Everyone is talking about kind of getting to normalized levels, just call it in the near term here next couple of quarters. And I guess, just thoughts on getting this normalized level of losses when unemployment is all-time low, wages are growing. Obviously, there's inflationary pressures, but it's just a little surprising, again, not to Citi-specific, but it's a little surprising that we're getting to this normalized state when things seem like they're pretty good.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Jane Fraser,"Yes, I think well, also normalized state back in 2019 was also pretty good. So, you're not hearing any alarm bells ringing from Mark or myself at all here on the U.S. consumer, I think we see the U.S. consumer as resilient, we've talked about them being cautious but they're not recessionary. And we are seeing more pressure on the lower FICOs. We don't have a large number of that in our portfolio, but that is where we're seeing more of the normalization happening on the payment rates, for example, and other behaviors in there. So, it's quite localized, but I don't think we should be overly concerned here about the health of the U.S. consumer. And as Mark said, we're in a very unusual environment. Higher inflation, these rate levels and a strong labor market. And under those conditions, it's the debt service ratio, as he said, that is, we think, is a more useful leading indicator that we keep a close eye on.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Mark Mason,"Just remember, it's a return to normal.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Operator,And our next question comes from Gerard Cassidy with RBC.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Gerard Cassidy,"Mark, can you share with us, in your financial supplement, obviously, you give us good details on your credit picture and we're talking about credit right now. The nonaccrual loans have been flat as a pancake for the last 12 months for you folks and the industry as well. And this is in light of the Fed funds rates, as we all know, have been up over 500 basis points. Can you guys share with us why we haven't seen more, this is mostly corporate of course, but everybody has been hanging in there very well in view of the fact that rates have gone up so much. What are your customers telling you or are you seeing that has enabled them to remain very healthy in light of a 500-basis point increase in interest rates?",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Mark Mason,"I think I'd point to a couple of things, Gerard. One is, remember, we focus on the large multinational, largely investment-grade quality names. And so that's one important factor when you think about our ICG and corporate exposure there. The second thing I'd point out is we have to remember that many of these companies had and still have very strong balance sheets and that they've managed that through the COVID and pandemic situation and that has positioned them well. I think the third thing is that and you've heard us mention how we're proactively managing the prospect of a recession. And I think when I talk to other CFOs, I know that when Jane talks to other CEOs, they too are looking at their expense line. They too are looking at the efficiency of their organizations and opportunity to increase that efficiency in light of a potential slowdown or recessionary environment. And then the final point is, I think a lot of firms have been that were proactive in the low-rate environment, in shoring up that balance sheet strength. Now with that said, you've heard us also mention the prospect of a rebound in capital market activities, and that has to happen at some point. But sticking to your point around credit, I really think it's those factors that you see play through in not only our very low NAL, but also our very low credit losses, credit cost that you've seen in our business.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Gerard Cassidy,"And then as a follow-up, when you think about what we've seen with the Fed's tightening over the last 12 months, banks like your own have positioned the balance sheet accordingly and I know the Bank Analysts Association of Boston, Michael [Verdeschi] did a good job explaining how you guys manage the balance sheet. And when you look at it going forward, do you think changes are coming because the Fed if they end in Fed funds rate increase as we get to a terminal rate, how are you guys positioned the balance sheet, do you think going forward?",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Mark Mason,"Look, we're constantly actively managing the balance sheet in light of not only our client needs, but also how we see the broader macro environment evolving and changing. And as you know, and I know you've seen and we've talked about before, we share in our Qs, our view on our estimate for interest rate exposure and what happens with 100 basis points swing in rates in one direction or another across the curve across currencies. You've seen that shift over the last number of quarters to last quarter where that estimate for IRE was about $1.7 billion or so, but heavily skewed towards non-U.S. dollar rates and currencies. And I think as we think about the view on how rates will evolve, you'll see a continued shift there. I think that that when we look to print this quarter, number will probably come down a bit in terms of interest rate exposure and skew even more towards non-U.S. dollar currencies in light of where rates are in those markets and the U.S. dollar will likely be somewhat neutral in light of that curve currently looks like. But again, something we actively manage, first with an eye towards what client demand and needs are likely to be for use of our liquidity but also with a view for how the macro environment might evolve and what we're hearing from central banks around the world.","billion, liquidity",yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Operator,And our next question comes from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Mike Mayo,"I meant to follow up earlier on the bending of the cost curve, but if you were to put different initiatives in terms of how far along you are maybe like your exits might be in the eighth inning, and your transformation might be in the sixth inning, and your remediation in the fifth inning, the simplification in the first inning or second inning. Are those numbers correct? How would you put those numbers? And in terms of bending the cost curve, where are you further along and where are you just getting started?",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Mark Mason,"Well, Mike, you know I love you, but I'm not going to play that game. What I will say is that we clearly have work that we're doing as it relates to the exits, but making very good progress on that, not just on the closing of the exits but also on putting a dent in the stranded costs associated with those exits that we have closed. And so, as Jane mentioned in her prepared remarks, by the time we get to end of the year, ex-Mexico, we would have made a considerable amount of progress on there, and that creates an opportunity to do more around the simplification of the organization and so that simplification is obviously in an earlier inning, call it, the exits in a later inning. I think that the transformation spend investments and those things, look we are squarely into execution, as you've heard us mention before. And as I've mentioned, the expense base around that is going to continue to morph from spend that we've made around third-party consultants and that helped in the crafting of the plan towards technology, towards people that are critically involved in the execution of it and then a downward trajectory towards the benefits we get from that technology and reduced operational expense. And so, it's a multi-year journey, we've talked about that. We've got a number of years to continue to execute against it. But what's important is we know what we have to do, both in how we're investing that money and as it relates to being disciplined about our cost structure and bending the curve. And again, that's what we're going to do.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Mike Mayo,"And one more attempt, can you remind us how many people are working on the transformation remediation and how much that's costing you?",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Mark Mason,"Yes think the number I shared was somewhere around 13,000 people or so that are broadly working on the efforts here. We haven't gotten into specific costs; you know it's in the total number. But what I would say again is that we're clear on what we've got to deliver and execute against and we're managing that cost very tightly. We're constantly looking at opportunities to deliver on those transformation deliverables, more efficiently, leveraging technology, leveraging AI in some instances. And so we're not just taking those execution plans as they were crafted and delivering against them. But we're looking for efficiencies and even the execution plans as they're constructed today. And that's important for us to keep doing.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Operator,And our next question comes from Ken Usdin with Jefferies.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Ken Usdin,"I know this is going long here. Just a quick one, just, Mark, just wanted to get your sense on the sentiment around client activity in both the Markets group and what the pipelines are looking like in Investment Banking and the feel for that? Thanks.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Jane Fraser,"Look, I'll jump in here. Corporates are pretty cautious. They've got another Fed hike in the offing, tensions in China and the West, OPEC and all, and a general sense of more limited growth. But I think clients have been trying to understand and get their arms around both the macro and the market outlook for a while. I think they now seem to accept the current environment is new normal and are beginning to position themselves globally. So globally, we're seeing less anxiety around funding as most large corps are biting the bullet and paying higher rates to take advantage of issuance windows, balance sheet is getting reinforced, we certainly don't see a large cap credit prices on the horizon. And on the IB side, it remains, the pipeline is robust. There's a lot of pent-up demand for M&A but it's hard to predict when that pipeline will unlock. ECM had tangible momentum over Q1, and we're also seeing sponsor lev fin showing signs of improvement, but both of those are from a very, very low base. And on the investor side, most of the investors stayed on the sidelines in Q2. The debt ceiling was a bigger topic than economic news was, and then it was a very low vol environment. We saw a bit of a pickup at the beginning with the light bump in volatility in the last few days, but I wouldn't call that a trend yet.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Operator,And our next question comes from Charles Peabody with Portales.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Charles Peabody,"A question about your Markets related net interest income. And before I ask the question, I do appreciate that you run those businesses on a holistic basis and that NII is probably more of a residual outcome. But a couple of questions related to Markets-related NII. First is, you had a pretty nice jump up in the second quarter versus the first quarter. And I just wanted to understand, is that largely related to seasonal dividend issues? And then secondly, you have a positive NII outcome, where a lot of your money center in brethren will have a negative NII outcome for Markets and I was just wondering what the difference is? Is it the outsized FICC business relative to Equities? Or is it the international? Or is it how you hedge? What's the difference on that? So those are the 2 questions.",net interest income,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Mark Mason,"Thanks for the question, and thanks for the acknowledgment that we do manage our Markets revenues in total, so I appreciate that. What I would say in terms of the Markets NII is, you've captured it right, which is the dynamic that's playing out between first quarter and second quarter is, in fact, dividend season. And again, given the globality of our franchise, the dividend is not just a dividend in any one region, but dividend in multiple regions playing out over the course of the first and second quarter. I can't speak to the peers at this particular stage. But what I would say is that you know that our book skews more so than peers to corporates, and that's important. And we obviously have a very, very strong FICC business more broadly as well. So dividend season, major driver here in that increase.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Charles Peabody,"Okay. And just as a follow-up, is there any sort of directional guidance you can give on Markets related to NII? I mean does it mean to the extent second quarter was bolstered by dividend, it comes down in the third quarter, but then does it go back up in the fourth quarter? So would the second half be kind of equivalent to the first half?",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Mark Mason,"Charles, I really appreciate the attempt there. But I'm not going to give any further guidance on the breakout of the NII, I will reiterate the ex-Markets NII increase, by the way, to plus $46 billion but thanks for question. I appreciate that.",billion,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Operator,And our next question comes from Vivek Juneja with JP Morgan.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Vivek Juneja,"Couple of questions. Number one, so capital, Jane and Mark, going back to that, should we expect that given what you've mentioned, given everything going on in the regulatory environment, ratio you're at currently, it should grow in anticipation of what may come or likely to come with all the regulatory stuff? Or are you going to try and keep that closer to the 13.3%?",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Jane Fraser,"I think we're going to see exactly what the framework is that comes out and then the implementation time frame for it and then look at making adjustments to plan, also hoping that the comment period is taken seriously and the different considerations I talked about earlier are taken into effect. Then we'll work through what are adjustments we make, pricing capital reallocation, etc., the playbook that you would expect the same one that we've done with SA-CCR and we've done with a number of other pieces. And we would also hope to see our SCB in a different place for the same reasons we talked about earlier Vivek, because there's a lot of volatility in that SCB dependent on the scenario that comes out every year. And I would say, given the shifts we're making in the business model, we'd expect to see that one come down.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Mark Mason,"The only thing I'd add is again, the CET1 ratio of the 13.3% as of October 1, would be a 12.3% reg of October 1. As Jane mentioned, the NPR as it comes out, we'll take a look at that and see if there are implications on the CET1 stack, but more likely implications on the risk-weighted assets, right? And what's really important there aside from the very important points Jane made in terms of considering broader factors is the timing of the implementation of whatever that final rule includes and obviously, the more timing for implementation, the more of an ability it gets for the industry to think about how to absorb the implications there.","cet1, risk-weighted assets",yes,Yes,"cet1, risk-weighted assets",No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,Yes,cet1 ratio
2023,Q2,Vivek Juneja,But I'm presuming you want to go sooner rather than later because the market is going to expect that rather than take a full 3 years or whatever the Fed might give you.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Mark Mason,"You know what, I'm really interested at this point in seeing the proposal, and then we'll have a chance to kind of, to really react as an industry and as a firm.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Vivek Juneja,"Completely unrelated, if I may. Noninterest-bearing deposits, what are you seeing given you're very heavily corporate driven. When I look at your point-to-point because you don't give a full average balance sheet, it's only interest-bearing related. But the noninterest-bearing is only available on a period end. If I look at that, there was a big drop in the U.S. this quarter. Anything unusual? Is that accelerating? What are you seeing amongst your clients, people still waking up? And what have you factored into your NII guidance for that?",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Mark Mason,"Well, again, I think the point I'd make here is that we continue to see clients shift from kind of noninterest-bearing deposits and into both interest-bearing and CDs and other higher-yielding products in light of the rate environment that we're in. And I would expect us to continue to see those types of shifts subject to how rates continue to evolve. And again, on the corporate side, we've seen in the U.S. clients have reached kind of those terminal,that terminal level, terminal betas, I should say, outside of the U.S. rate hikes, I think, are still in the future, as Jane alluded to, and the terminal betas have not quite yet been reached. But in terms of the noninterest-bearing, we are seeing that dynamic play out.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Jane Fraser,"Thank you, Jenn, and good morning to everyone. Before I discuss the results of the quarter, let me first address the regulatory actions by the Federal Reserve and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency which were announced on Wednesday. These actions pertain to the consent orders we entered into with both agencies in 2020 and those orders covered four primary areas: risk management, data governance, controls and compliance. Addressing these areas is the primary goal of our Transformation, our number one priority. It is a multi-year effort to modernize our infrastructure, unify disparate tech management. We have been public this year about the fact that we were behind in this particular area and that we had increased our investment as a result. The regulatory actions consisted of two civil money penalties and, under the amended consent order with the OCC, a new process designed to ensure we are allocating sufficient resources to meet our remediation milestones, called the Resource Review Plan. We are currently developing the Plan for submission to the OCC. By way of background, while the Federal Reserve is the primary regulator for Citigroup, our bank holding company, the OCC is the primary regulator for Citibank, N.A. or CBNA, which is our largest banking vehicle with approximately 70% of our assets. The amended consent order with the OCC allows CBNA, to continue paying to Citigroup, at a minimum, the dividends necessary for debt service, preferred dividends, and other non-discretionary obligations. While we are developing and seeking OCC consent for our Resource Review -objection. These dividends are intercompany payments that are made from CBNA ultimately to the parent, Citigroup. They should not be confused with the common dividends Citigroup pays to its shareholders. Indeed, there is no restriction on k shares. And let me be very clear, even with the investments needed for our Transformation, Citigroup has more than sufficient resources to also invest in our businesses, and make the planned return of capital to our shareholders. We will increase our dividend from 53 to 56 cents a share, as we announced in late June, and will resume modest buybacks this quarter. While these actions were not entirely unexpected to us, it is no doubt disappointing for our investors and our people. We completely understand that. At the same time, we are confident in our ability to get these specific areas where they need to be, as we have been able to do in other areas of the Transformation. And we are pleased that it was acknowledged on Wednesday that we have made meaningful progress in executing our Transformation, and simplifying our firm. A multi-year undertaking such as this was never going to be linear. The investments we have been making are starting to come together to reduce risk, improve controls and deliver tangible outcomes. The tech investments we have made are making a difference. We have reduced the time it takes to book loans; automated controls for our traders to reduce errors; moved risk analytics to a cloud-based infrastructure; and increased the resiliency of our platforms to reduce downtime. The changes to our organization and our culture are making a difference. We have eliminated managerial constructs and layers whilst empowering our leaders. We introduced new tools to better manage human capital needs. Our focus on culture has increased accountability and attracted great commitment that we will address any area of the consent order where we are behind by putting the necessary resources and focus behind it. We will get this work where it needs to be, as we have with the execution of our strategy and the simplification of our organization. Now, turning to what was another good quarter, our results show the relentless focus we have in executing our strategy as we continue to drive towards our medium-term return targets. We reported net income of $3.2 billion with an earnings per share of $1.52 and an ROTCE of 7.2%. Revenues were up 4% overall, as well as up in each of our five core businesses, where all but one had positive operating leverage. Expenses were down 2% year-over-year. The steps we are taking to simplify our organization, right-size businesses such as Markets and Wealth, and reduce stranded costs are beginning to take hold, even as we increase investment in our Transformation. Over the medium term, we expect these simplification and stranded cost actions to drive the $2 to $2.5 billion in annual run-rate saves. Services grew 3% driven by solid fee growth, which we have prioritized. TTS saw increased activity in cross border payments and in commercial cards. Securities Services was up 10%, with new client onboardings, deepening with existing clients, and market valuations helping increase our assets under custody by a preliminary 9%. At our recent Services Investor Day, we very much enjoyed the opportunity to talk to you in-depth about how we are going to continue to grow this high-returning business. And we are very pleased that people are starting to recognize why we describe it as our crown jewel. Overall, Markets had a strong finish to the quarter leading to better performance than we had anticipated. Fixed Income was slightly down year-on-year due to lower FX and Rates, but we had good issuance and loan growth in Financing & Securitization, an area which generates attractive returns. Equities was up 37%, driven by strong performance in derivatives which includes a gain on the Visa B exchange offer. Banking was up 38% as the wallet rebound gained some momentum and we again grew share. Our clients continued to access the debt capital markets with investment grade issuance near record levels. Equity issuance increased, particularly in convertibles, as companies wait for a fuller opening of the IPO window. Investment Banking fees were up 63% versus the prior year. We have seen some healthy volumes associated with announced deals year to date, particularly in Natural Resources and Technology. Combined with a strong pipeline, advisory activity looks promising as we think about the rest of the year and into next year. Wealth is starting to improve. Growth in client investment assets drove stronger Investment revenue, especially in Citigold, and was up a preliminary 15%. Our focus on rationalizing the expense base is starting to pay off, with expenses down 4%. Andy and his team continue to attract top talent from the industry as they focus on our investments business and on enhancing the client experience. U.S. Personal Banking saw revenue growth of 6%, with all three businesses again contributing to the topline. There was good revolving balance and loan growth in both branded cards and retail services. We continue to see differentiation in the credit segments with the lower income customers seeing pressure. Retail Banking benefitted from higher mortgage loans and improved deposit spreads, while delivering strong referrals to Wealth. Overall, while we saw operating margin expansion, our poor returns were pressured by the combination of credit seasonality and the normalization of certain vintages. We certainly The recent stress tests again showcased the strength of our balance sheet. Our CET1 ratio now stands at 13.6%, and we expect our regulatory capital requirement to decrease to 12.1% as of October 1st given the reduction of our stress capital buffer. Our tangible book value per share grew to $87.53. During the quarter, we returned $1 billion in capital to our common shareholders, and we are increasing our dividend by 6%. We expect to buyback $1 billion in common shares this quarter and we will continue to assess the level of buybacks on a quarterly basis, particularly given the uncertainty around the Basel III endgame. structurally sound economy. After a break in progress, inflation now appears back on a downward trajectory. Services spending has remained on an upward trend although there are clear signs of a softening labor market and the tightening of the consumer budget. And of course, you might have heard there is an mpetitiveness continues to be a drag on growth. In Asia, China is growing moderately, albeit with government stimulus, and their pivot to high-tech manufacturing is being challenged by tariffs on EVs and semi-conductors. Despite this uncertainty, as you saw at our Services Investor Day, when we went through our performance over the last two years, our business model can produce good results in a variety of macro environments. And there is plenty of upside for us across our five businesses. We have made an incredible amount of progress in simplification- both strategically and organizationally. We have completed most of the exits of our international consumer markets. We streamlined our organization to catalyze agility and faster decision making. We are modernizing our infrastructure to improve our client service and automating processes to strengthen controls. We are on a deliberate path. We will continue to execute our Transformation and our strategy so we can meet our medium-term targets and then continue to further improve our returns over time. With that, I would like to turn it over to Mark and then we would be delighted, as always, to take your questions.","billion, , revenue, net income, loan growth, cet1",yes,Yes,cet1,No,,No,,No,,No,,Yes,"federal reserve, occ",Yes,basel iii,Yes,cet1 ratio
2024,Q2,Mark Mason,"Thanks, Jane and good morning, everyone. I am going to start with the firmwide financial results, focusing on year-over-year comparisons for the second quarter unless I indicate otherwise, and then spend a little more time on the businesses. On slide 6, we show financial results for the full firm. For the quarter, we reported net income of approximately $3.2 billion, EPS of $1.52 and an RoTCE of 7.2% on $20.1 billion of revenues. Total revenues were up 4%, driven by growth across all businesses as well as an approximate $400 million gain related to the Visa B exchange offer. A significant portion of this gain is reflected in Equity Markets, with the remainder reflected in All Other. Expenses were $13.4 billion, down 2%, and 6% on a sequential basis. The combination of revenue growth and expense decline drove positive operating leverage for the firm and the majority of our businesses. Cost of credit was $2.5 billion, primarily driven by higher Card net credit losses, which were partially offset by ACL releases in all businesses except USPB, where we built for loan growth. At the end of the quarter, we had nearly $22 billion in total reserves with a reserve-to-funded loans ratio of approximately 2.7%. On slide 7, we show the expense trend over the past five quarters. This quarter we reported expenses of $13.4 billion, down 2%, and 6% sequentially, which includes the $136 million civil money penalties imposed by the Fed and OCC earlier this week. The decrease in expenses was primarily driven by savings associated with our organizational simplification, stranded cost reductions, and lower repositioning costs, partially offset by continued investment in Transformation and the Fed and the OCC penalties. As we said over the past few months, we will continue to invest in the Transformation and technology to modernize our operations and risk and control infrastructure. We expect these investments to offset some of our saves and headcount reduction going forward. However, based on what we now know today, we will likely be at the higher end of the expense guidance range, excluding the FDIC special assessment and the civil money penalties. With that said, we will, of course, look for opportunities to absorb the CMP. on the Transformation and address what the Fed and OCC announced Wednesday. We have made good progress on our Transformation in certain areas over the last few years, and I want to highlight some of those areas before discussing the announcement. First, Wholesale Credit and Loan operations, where we implemented a consistent end to end operating model and consolidated multiple systems with enhanced technology. This has not only reduced risk but enhanced operating efficiency and the client experience. We have also made improvements in risk and compliance as we enhanced our risk assessments and technology capabilities to increase automation for monitoring. And in Data, while there is a lot more to do, we have stood up a data governance process and streamlined our data architecture to ultimately facilitate straight through processing. Overall, we have improved risk management, and consolidated and upgraded systems and platforms to improve our resiliency. These efforts represent meaningful examples of how we are making progress against our Transformation milestones. That said, we have fallen short in data quality management particularly related to regulatory reporting, which we have acknowledged publicly since the beginning of the year. As such, we have begun to put additional investments and resources in place to not only address data quality management related to regulatory reporting and data governance, but also related to stress testing capabilities, including DFAST and Resolution Recovery. We also re-prioritized our efforts to ensure we are focused on data that impacts these reports first. We take this feedback from our regulators very seriously and we are committed to allocating all the resources necessary to meet their expectations. Now turning back to the quarterly results. On slide 9, we show net interest income, deposits, and loans where In the second quarter, net interest income was roughly flat. Excluding Markets, net interest income was down 3%, largely driven by the impact of foreign exchange translation, seasonally lower revolving card balances and lower interest rates in Argentina, partially offset by higher deposit spreads in Wealth. Average loans were roughly flat, as growth in Cards and Mexico Consumer was largely offset by slight declines across businesses. And average deposits decreased by 1%, largely driven by seasonal outflows and transfers to investments in Wealth as well as non-operational outflows in TTS. On slide 10, we show key consumer and corporate credit metrics, which reflect our disciplined risk appetite framework. Across our card portfolios, approximately 86% of our card loans are to consumers with FICO scores of 660 or higher. And while we continue to see an overall resilient US consumer, we also continue to see a divergence in performance and behavior across FICO and income bands. When we look across our consumer clients, only the highest income quartile has more savings than they did at the beginning of 2019. And it is the over 740 FICO customers that are driving the spend growth and maintaining high payment rates. Lower FICO band customers are seeing sharper drops in payment rates and borrowing more as they are more acutely impacted by high inflation and interest rates. That said, as we will discuss later, we are seeing signs of stabilization in delinquency performance across our cards portfolios. And we have taken this all into account in our reserving and we remain well reserved with a reserve-to-funded loan ratio of 8.1% for our total card portfolio. Our Corporate portfolio is largely investment grade, at approximately 82% as of the second quarter. And we saw a nearly $500 million sequential decrease in corporate non-accrual loans, largely driven by upgrades and repayments. Additionally, this quarter we saw an improvement in our macro assumptions driven by HPI, oil prices and equity market valuations. And our credit loss reserves continue to incorporate a scenario-weighted average unemployment rate of nearly 5%, and a downside scenario unemployment rate of nearly 7%. As such, we feel very comfortable with the nearly $22 billion of reserves that we have in the current environment. t to highlight the strength of our balance sheet, capital and liquidity. It is this strength that allows us to support clients through periods of uncertainty and volatility. Our balance sheet is a reflection of our risk appetite, strategy and diversified business model. Our $1.3 trillion deposit base is well diversified across regions, industries, customers and account types. The majority of our deposits are corporate, at $807 billion, and span 90 countries. And as you heard at the Services ID, most of these deposits are held in operating accounts that are crucial to how our clients fund their daily operations around the world, making them operational in nature and therefore very stable. The majority of our remaining deposits, about $404 billion, are well diversified across the Private Bank, Citigold, Retail and Wealth at Work offerings, as well as across regions and products. Of our total deposits, 68% are US dollar denominated with the remainder spanning over 60 currencies. Our asset mix also reflects our strong risk appetite framework. Our $688 billion loan portfolio is well diversified across consumer and corporate loans. And about one-third of our balance sheet is held in cash and high-quality, short duration investment securities that contribute to our approximately $900 billion of available liquidity resources. We continue to feel very good about the strength of our balance sheet and the quality of our assets and liabilities, which position us to be a source of strength for the industry and, importantly, for our clients. On slide 12, we show a sequential walk to provide more detail on the drivers of our CET1 ratio this quarter. We ended the quarter with a preliminary 13.6% CET1 capital ratio, approximately 130 basis points, or approximately $15 billion, above our current regulatory capital requirement of 12.3%. We expect our regulatory capital requirement to decrease to 12.1% as of October 1st, which incorporates the reduction in our Stress Capital Buffer from 4.3% to the indicative SCB of 4.1% we announced a couple weeks ago. We were pleased to see the improvement in our DFAST results, and the corresponding reduction in our SCB. That said, even with the reduction, our capital requirement does not yet fully reflect our simplification efforts, the benefits of our transformation or the full execution of our strategy, all of which we expect to reduce our capital requirements over time. And as a reminder, we announced an increase to our common dividend from $0.53 per share to $0.56 per share following the SCB results. And as Jane mentioned earlier, we plan on doing $1 billion of buybacks this quarter. So now turning to slide 13. Before I get into the businesses, as a reminder, in the fourth quarter of last year, we implemented a revenue sharing arrangement within Banking, and between Banking, Services and Markets to reflect the benefit the businesses get from our relationship-based lending. The impact of revenue rvices, revenues were up 3% this quarter, reflecting continued underlying momentum across both TTS and Securities Services. Net interest income was down 1%, largely driven by lower earnings on our net investment in Argentina, partially offset by the benefit of higher U.S. and Non-US interest rates relative to the prior-year period. Non-interest revenue increased 11%, driven by continued strength across underlying fee drivers, as well as a smaller impact from currency devaluation in Argentina. The underlying growth in both businesses is a result of our continued investments in product innovation, client experience and platform modernization that we highlighted during our Services Investor Day last month. Expenses increased 9%, largely driven by an Argentina-related transaction tax expense, a legal settlement expense and continued investments in product innovation and technology. Cost of credit was a benefit of $27 million, driven by an ACL release in the quarter. Average loans were up 3%, primarily driven by continued demand for export and agency finance, particularly in Asia, as well as working capital loans to corporate and commercial clients in Latin America and Asia. Average deposits were down 1%, driven by non-operating deposit outflows. At the same time, we continue to see good operating deposit inflows. Net income was approximately $1.5 billion. And Services continues to deliver a high RoTCE, coming in at 23.8% for the quarter. On slide 14, we show the results for Markets for the second quarter. Markets revenues were up 6%. Fixed Income revenues decreased 3%, driven by Rates and Currencies, which were down 11% on the back of lower volatility and tighter spreads. This was partially offset by strength in Spread Products and Other Fixed Income, which was up 20% primarily driven by continued loan growth and higher securitization and underwriting fees. In addition to a benefit from the Visa B exchange offer, we continued to see good underlying momentum in Equities, primarily driven by Equity Derivatives. And we continued to make progress in prime with balances up approximately 18%. Expenses decreased 1%, driven by productivity savings, partially offset by higher volume-related expenses. Cost of credit was a benefit of $11 million, as an ACL release more than offset net credit losses. Average loans increased 11%, largely driven by asset-backed lending in Spread Products. Average trading assets increased 12%, largely driven by client demand for Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities. Markets generated positive operating leverage and delivered net income of approximately $1.4 billion with an RoTCE of 10.7% for the quarter. On slide 15, we show the results for Banking for the second quarter. Banking revenues increased 38%, driven by growth in Investment banking and Corporate Lending. Investment Banking revenues increased 60%, driven by strength across Capital Markets and Advisory, given favorable market conditions. DCM continued to benefit from strong issuance activity, mainly in Investment Grade, as issuers continued to de-risk funding plans in advance of what could be a more volatile second half in the context of a number of important global elections as well as the macro environment. In ECM, excluding China A activity, led by the US, as well as continued convertible issuance, as issuers take advantage of strong equity market performance and expectations for rates to be higher for longer. And in Advisory, we are seeing revenues from the relatively low announced activity in 2023 coming to fruition as those transactions close. Both year-to-date and in the quarter, we gained share across DCM, ECM and Advisory, particularly in Corporate Lending revenues, excluding mark-to-market on loan hedges, increased 7%, largely driven by higher revenue share. We generated positive operating leverage again this quarter as expenses decreased 10%, primarily driven by actions taken to right size the expense base. Cost of credit was a benefit of $32 million, driven by an ACL release reflecting an improvement in the macroeconomic outlook, partially offset by net credit losses. Average loans decreased 4% as we maintained strict discipline around returns combined with lower overall demand for credit. Net income was $406 million and RoTCE was 7.5% for the quarter. On slide 16, we show the results for Wealth for the second quarter. Wealth revenues increased 2%, driven by a 13% increase in NIR from higher investment fee revenues, partially offset by a 4% decrease in NII from higher mortgage funding costs. We continue to see good momentum in non-interest revenue as we benefited from double-digit client investment asset growth, both in North America and internationally, driven by net new client investment assets as well as market valuations. Expenses were down 4%, driven by the initial benefits of expense reductions as we right size the workforce and expense base. Cost of credit was a benefit of $9 million, as an ACL release more than offset net credit losses. Preliminary end-of-period client balances increased 9%, driven by higher client investment assets as well as higher deposits. Average loans were flat, as we continued to optimize capital usage. Average deposits increased 2%, largely reflecting the transfer of relationships and the associated deposits from USPB, partially offset by a shift in deposits to higher- Client investment assets were up 15%, driven by net new investment asset flows and the benefit of higher market valuations. Wealth generated positive operating leverage this quarter and delivered Net income of $210 million with an RoTCE of 6.4% for the quarter. On slide 17, we show the results for US Personal Banking for the second quarter. US Personal Banking revenues increased 6%, driven by NII growth of 5% and lower partner payments. Branded Cards revenues increased 8%, driven by interest-earning balance growth of 9% as payment rates continue to moderate. And we continue to see growth in spend volumes up 3%, primarily driven by customers with FICO scores of 740 or higher. Retail Services revenues increased 6%, primarily driven by lower payments from Citi to our partners due to higher net credit losses. And interest-earning balances grew 8%. Retail Banking revenues increased 3%, driven by higher deposit spreads, as well as mortgage and installment loan growth. USPB also generated positive operating leverage this quarter, with expenses down 2%, driven by lower technology and compensation costs, partially offset by higher volume-related expenses. Cost of credit increased to $2.3 billion, largely driven by higher NCLs of $1.9 billion and an ACL build of approximately $400 million reflecting volume growth in the quarter. But let me remind you of the three things driving our NCLs this quarter. First, card loan vintages that were originated over the last few years are all maturing at the same time. These vintages were delayed in their maturation due to the unprecedented levels of government stimulus during the pandemic. Second, we continue to see seasonally higher NCLs in the second quarter. Third, certain pockets of customers continue to be impacted by persistent inflation and high interest rates resulting in higher losses. However, across both portfolios we are seeing signs of stabilization in delinquency performance, but we will continue to watch the impact of persistent inflation and high interest rates as the year progresses. Despite these factors we still expect Branded Cards to be in the 3.5% to 4.0% NCL range for the full year and Retail services to be at the high end of the range of 5.75% to 6.25%. Average deposits decreased 18%, as the transfer of relationships and the associated deposits to our Wealth business more than offset the underlying growth. Net income was $121 million and RoTCE for the quarter was 1.9%. said before, we will continue to take actions to manage through regulatory headwinds, lap the credit cycle and grow revenue while improving the overall operating efficiency of the business to ultimately get to a high teens return over the medium term. On slide 18, we show results for All Other on a managed basis, which includes Corporate Other and Legacy Franchises and excludes divestiture-related items. Revenues decreased 22%, primarily driven by the closed exits and wind-downs and higher funding costs, partially offset by growth in Mexico as well as the impact from the Visa B exchange offer. And expenses decreased 7%, primarily driven by closed exits and wind downs. Slide 19 shows our full year 2024 outlook and medium-term guidance, both of which remain unchanged. We continue to remain laser focused on executing on our transformation and enhancing the businesses performance. And while we recognize there is a lot more to do on Transformation, we are pleased with the progress we are making towards our 2024 and Medium-term targets and remain committed to these targets. With that, Jane and I will be happy to take your questions.","capital ratio, billion, , revenue, net income, liquidity, million, loan growth, trillion, net interest income, cet1",yes,Yes,"cet1, capital ratio",No,,No,,Yes,dfast,No,,Yes,"occ, fdic",No,,Yes,cet1 ratio

Operator",Our first question will come from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Mike Mayo,"Hi. Could you elaborate more on the amended consent order, Jane? You said it was disappointing to have gotten that this week. It's almost four years into the consent order. And a little bit why it hasn't been resolved and what's on, that's the loss column and maybe a little bit more on the win column too. I mean, you have what 12,000 people thrown at the problem. Billions of dollars. Is it not enough people? Is it not enough money? Do you need to look at it in a different way? Are you not talking the same language? I mean, you have John Dugan as your lead independent director, ex head of the OCC, and it seems like you got your report card. I guess you passed overall. They went out of their way to say some nice things, but it looks like you got failing grades in data and regulatory management. So, you're confident it's going to be resolved, but it's already been four years and it hasn't been resolved. So what is it going to take from here and how can you resolve the regulatory concerns while continuing or serving shareholders better? And then in the win column, since it's so nebulous this back office, what are you achieving? You mentioned some items, but if you could put more meat on those bones. Thanks.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,Yes,occ,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Jane Fraser,"Yes. Thank you, Mike. That's a few different parts to that, so let's start by just taking a step back. Our transformation is addressing decades of under-investment in large parts of Citi's infrastructure and in our risk and control environment. And when you unpack that, those areas where we had an absence of enforced enterprise-wide standards and governance, we've had a siloed organization that's prevented scale, a culture where a lot of groups were allowed to solve problem the same problem in different ways, fragmented tech platforms, manual processes and controls, and a weak first line of defense, too few subject matter experts. So, this is a massive body of work that goes well beyond the consent order and this is not old Citi putting in Band-Aids. This is Citi tackling the root issues head on. It's a multiyear undertaking as we've talked about and you saw the statement by one of our regulators this week, we have made meaningful progress on our transformation and on our simplification. Mark?",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Mark Mason,"Yeah, and so as Jane says, the progress that we've made, it spans multiple parts of the consent order and transformation work. Remember, that consent order and transformation work includes risk, it includes controls, it includes compliance, it includes data and data related to the regulatory reporting, and we've got evidence and proof points of progress against all of those things.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Jane Fraser,"Thank you, Mark. So transforming, to answer your question about how do we fix it and serve our investors at the same time. Transforming Citi will drive benefits for our shareholders, our clients, and our regulators. This is not mutually exclusive. At the beginning of the year, we honed in on two priorities, the transformation and improving our business performance, and we're able to do so because we've largely cleared the decks. We have a clear focus strategy, we've executed the divestitures, we've got a much simpler organization, so we can focus on these two priorities and we are able to do both. You can see that in our results again this quarter, multiple, solid proof points on the execution of the strategy and we know what we need to do on both fronts. We have plans in place on the transformation and on the strategy and we're executing against them. We have been and we will be transparent when we have issues and how we're addressing them.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Mark Mason,"And just to add a couple of data points to that, Mike. You've heard us mention some of these before, but we've retired platforms. We've reduced the number of data centers. Platforms are down some 300. We've moved from 39 corporate loan platforms down to south of 20. We've got 20 cash equities execution platforms down to 1; we've reduced the 6 reporting ledgers down to 1; 11 sanctions platforms down to 1. So, we've been making considerable progress over the past couple of years. With that said, there's a lot more work to be done around the data regulatory reporting work. If you think about Citi, we've got 11,000 global total reg reports, right. So, we've got to make sure that the data that's going into those reports is the quality of the data that we want it to be, but more importantly, that we're doing it efficiently, that it doesn't take thousands of people to reconcile that information and so this is an end-to end process in the way we're approaching it. One example is the 2052a liquidity report that we have. It has 750,000 lines of data and that data is, it's important again that we're efficiently collecting it from multiple systems with standards and governance that ensures it's of the quality that we want it to be without again having to have manual activity supporting it.",liquidity,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Operator,The next question is from Glenn Schorr at Evercore. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Glenn Schorr,"Hi. Thank you. So, Mark, I heard your comments on credit this year. I'm talking the US Personal Banking. I heard your comments for credit the rest of this year and I think in a position that you're very conservatively reserved. But right now, you put up a 3% margin and credit costs are almost half of what revenues are in this space. I guess, my question is this: As we roll forward, in a slowing economy with likely a little bit lower some rate cuts, how does the P&L evolve? How does it improve from here? Because can we be expecting credit costs to come in, in a slowing economy? I'm just trying to figure out the path forward because it could be impactful if USPB obviously marches to where you need it to be.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Mark Mason,"Yeah, look, like I said, we do think that there is certainly upside to USPB. We're looking for that upside in the medium-term targets that we've set for ourselves. You've got to remember that when you look at the quarter and you look at the half, frankly, that we're still in a period where we're seeing the normalization of the cost of credit. And as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, you have kind of a compounding effect of multiple vintages now maturing at the same time that's playing through the P&L. That's not just true for us, that's true for others as well. And so we'd expect and we are we do believe we're seeing some signs of a cresting when you look at delinquencies now and so we would expect that those losses start to normalize and loss rates start to come down as we go towards the medium term. At the same time, we're investing in the business and we're looking to see continued growth in volume and on the top line. And the combination of those things, as we drive towards the medium term, will help us to deliver both the top line growth and certainly improve returns from where we sit today and in line with what we've guided to. So, it's a combination of top line performance from volume and obviously the environment plays into that, but we feel like we've got a reasonable assumption around top line growth there, cost of credit normalizing, continued discipline on the expense line, allowing for us to get improved returns across that USPB business.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Glenn Schorr,Okay. Appreciate all that. One quickie on DCM. You had amazingly good performance. There's been plenty of conversation about pull forward this year on just refi driving like three-quarters of the activity. Could you just help us think through the second half when thinking about DCM just to make sure that we don't like start modelling this into perpetuity?,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Jane Fraser,"Look, I think when we think about the back half of 2024, we're going to see a different mix of activity in Banking. We do still expect demand to be quite strong across our capital market products because you've got a wall of maturing debt securities coming up in the second half that carry on for a couple of years. But, we did see some clients accelerating issuances into the first half getting ahead of potential market volatility. So, if you put it all together, I think we expect the rate environment and the financing markets to continue to be accommodative as well as to continue deal making with M&A being a bit larger in the overall mix, although some of the regulatory elements have put a damper on part of that.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Mark Mason,"Yeah. Only thing I'd add to that is, look, the wallet for the year is obviously going to depend on a couple things, so, one, the return of a more normalized IPO market, two, the direction and volatility of interest rates, the ongoing global conflicts that we're all kind of seeing and witnessing, and then finally, as Jane mentioned in her remarks, the elections and what those outcomes look like, not just in the US, but abroad. And so there are a number of factors there that will play to the wallet. But as we said, we believe we're well-positioned to be there to serve our clients and to do so in a way that makes good economic sense.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Operator,The next question is from Jim Mitchell at Seaport Global. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Jim Mitchell,"Hey. Good morning. Just, Mark, maybe on NII, down almost 4% year-over-year. Seems a little bit more than the guidance was down modestly for the year. So, can you discuss sort of the puts and takes this quarter and how we should think about the quarterly trajectory for the rest of the year?",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Mark Mason,"Yeah. So, I'd say a couple things. So, one, as I mentioned, in the quarter and you see it on slide 9, ex-Markets, we're down about 3%. That's largely driven by some FX translation that played through, but also some seasonally lower revolving card balances and then lower interest rates in Argentina. And what that is in Argentina, we have capital there, the policy rate was adjusted downward and as that happened, we obviously earned less on that capital that flows through the NII line. As I think about the back half of the year and the guidance we have of modestly down, there are a couple of puts and takes to keep in mind. So, one is going to be rates, right, so as I think about the higher yield that we can earn on reinvestment, that'll be a tailwind that plays through from an NII point of view. The second would be volume growth, particularly in our card loans portfolio and we do expect to see continued volume growth across certainly the Branded portfolio and so that'll be another tailwind for us on the NII line. In terms of the headwinds, you've got the lower NII earned in Argentina from rates, that'll continue to play through. We've got assumed higher average betas in 2024, specifically on the non-US side. We still have in our forecast the impact of CFPB late fees, so assuming that that goes into effect for this year, that will have an impact and it's in the forecast, and then the impact of lost NII from the exits that we have. And so, the combination of those things will probably mean that NII in the back half of the year is a little bit higher than the first half, but again, consistent with the guidance that we gave of modestly down.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Jim Mitchell,"That's helpful. And maybe just quickly, kind of a similar question on expenses. Better-than expected this quarter, but there was no restructuring or repositioning charges. I think to get to the high end of your range, you'd have to be up a little bit in the back half from 2Q run rate. Is that because you expect more repositioning, restructuring in the second half or maybe just talk through expense trajectory from here?",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Mark Mason,"Yeah, so that's right. When I talk about it at the first quarter, I talked about kind of a downward trend for each of the quarters after Q1. The second quarter came in a bit lower than we were expecting. I'm sticking with the guidance and it does mean that the back half of the year will likely come in will come in higher than the second quarter. That's a combination of a couple of things, including the pace of hiring and investment that we will do in the transformation work that has to be done. It also includes repositioning charges that we might take or need to take as we continue to work through our businesses across the firm and the franchise and then the second quarter did or yeah, the second quarter did have a one-time or so and some delayed spending that will pick up in the third and fourth quarter around advertising and marketing and some of the other line items. So, yes, the third and fourth quarter, the back half will be higher than the second quarter, but consistent with the guidance that I've given.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Operator,The next question is from Erika Najarian at UBS. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Erika Najarian,"Hi. I had two questions and I'll ask the first one on expenses first since it's a good follow up to the previous. Mark, just to clarify. Let's just say, take the highest end of your range at $53.8 billion. Just trying to think about how consensus will move. So, we take that $53.8 billion and then add the $285 million of FDIC expenses year-to-date so far and add the civil money penalties of $136 million, so that gets us to $54.2 billion for the year and any other repositioning charges in the second half of the year would already be included in the $53.8 billion?","billion, million",no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,Yes,fdic,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Mark Mason,"So, yes. The answer to the last part of your question is yes. So in the range that I've given, $53.5 billion to $53.8 billion, that includes our estimate for the full year of repositioning and any restructuring charges. That range excludes the FDIC Special Assessment that we saw earlier in the year and it excludes the CMP of $136 million.","billion, million",yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,Yes,fdic,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Erika Najarian,"Got it. And my second question is for Jane and I'm sure you're getting tired of the question on capital return. So, you're buying back $1 billion, you plan to buy back $1 billion this quarter. It looks like you didn't buy back any in the second quarter. And I'm asking this question in this context because consensus has a buyback of nearly $1 billion in the fourth quarter and staying at this rate for the first half of next year and ramping higher. And I guess, is the $1 billion number a catch-up pace because you didn't buy back any in the second quarter? And I fully appreciate that you also have the Banamex IPO coming, which is different from peers that are also waiting for Basel clarification. But I'm just wondering, do we need to wait for that Banamex IPO for the company to feel comfortable moving away from that quarter-to-quarter guidance? And also, of course, I just want to readdress the beginning of the question when I asked specifically about the pace.",billion,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Jane Fraser,"Okay. So, we are not going to be giving guidance going forward around our buybacks. We are going to continue to give quarterly and make it a quarterly determination as to the level. And a lot of that is to do with the uncertainty about the forthcoming regulatory changes. I think we were delighted to see a slight reduction in our Stress Capital Buffer, reflecting the financial strength and resiliency of our business model and also good to see the benefits of our strategy playing out. But with the regulatory changes uncertain, that's one of the major factors for us to continue with the quarterly guidance.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Mark Mason,"Yeah, that's right. And on the first part of your question, Erika, I'd say, look, we were in discussions with our regulators and we made a prudent call as it relates to buybacks in the quarter for Q2. So, Q3, as we talked about, would be at $1 billion and that should not be necessarily viewed as a run rate level. As Jane mentioned, we'll take it quarter by quarter from here.",billion,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Operator,The next question is from Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Gerard Cassidy,"Thank you, Hi Jane, Hi Mark. Mark, regarding the comments you made about the higher credit losses, the three factors that you gave us, can you also talk about, if this was a factor at all for you folks, was there any FICO score inflation back during the pandemic that might be playing into these kind of credit losses? And as part of the credit card question, you mentioned the CFPB, the fees that you have factored in, the lower fees you factored that into your forward-look. Where do we stand on that? Do you guys have any color on that as well?",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Mark Mason,"Yeah, so, on the first part of the question, look, we all kind of have talked about in the past, the prospect of FICO inflation back during the COVID period of time. We've been very focused on ensuring that acquisitions that we've made have been appropriately kind of analyzed in the underwriting of that to get comfortable with the quality of new customers that we've been bringing on. In light of the environment, we have looked at moving towards higher FICO scores for new account acquisitions. But as I think about what we're seeing now, there is that dichotomy that I mentioned where we have the higher FICO score customers that are driving the spend growth and that frankly have still continued strong balances and savings and it's really the lower FICO band customers, where we're seeing the sharper drop in payment rates and more borrowing. And so, the FICO inflation has effectively kind of fizzled out when we look at the mix and dynamic of the customer portfolio that we have at this point. And in terms of the CFPB late fees, well, I don't have an update on that. Like I said, we've built in an assumption in our forecast. But in terms of the timing, I don't have a formal update on the certainty of it.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Operator,The next question is from Ken Usdin at Jefferies. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Ken Usdin,"Hey, thanks, good morning. Hey, Mark. Talking about the NII outlook and the fact that now we've got a little bit of a discrepancy starting between US rates, maybe higher for longer, and then the beginnings of some of the non-US curve starting to, at least put fourth their first cut. I know we've got that good chart that you have in the Qs about the relative contributions. Can you just help us understand a little bit of like just generally how you're thinking through that discrepancy and how that informs the difference between US-related NII and non-US-related NII as you go forward?",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Mark Mason,"Yeah, thank you. So look, I think that as we look at it, out through the certainly through the medium term, we expect to see continued NII growth at obviously a modest level, certainly lower than what we've seen historically and that's in large part because or in part I should say because of how we've been managing the balance sheet and that has allowed for us to reinvest as securities have rolled off and earn a higher yield on them relative to what we were earning, in some instances, they were five-year terms on some of these investments. And so we still think there's some upside from a reinvestment point of view. The point you make around kind of non-US dollar or US rates kind of coming off, that'll play through a little bit as we think about the beta increases that we're expecting outside of the US. And so, we've assumed that we have higher betas pick up outside of the US. If rates kind of come off in a more substantive way, then we could see kind of a little less NII pressure than we're forecasting there. But net-net, as I think about the combination of volume growth that we're expecting between loans and deposits over that medium term, the higher yield we can earn on our assets, combined with the pricing capabilities that we have across the portfolio, offsetting some of that beta, we believe we'll have continued NII growth. As I think about what I often point to in terms of the IRE analysis and you have to remember that that is a shock to the current balance sheet and it assumes that the full curve is moving simultaneously, cross currencies. And in that case, the 100 basis point parallel shift downward would be a negative $1.6 billion, with about $1.3 billion coming from non-US dollar. But again, that does assume that all of those currencies come down at the same time and doesn't account for the rebalancing of the balance sheet and things that I mentioned like the reinvestment higher yields that we'd be able to earn.",billion,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Ken Usdin,Got it. Okay. And just one follow-up on the OCC amendment and that's specifically related to the Resource Review Plan. Do you have a line of sight on how long that'll take you guys to finish because it seems like and is that what we should be thinking about in terms of just understanding like what the side of what you need to get done in terms of the other language that's written in the order?,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,Yes,occ,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Jane Fraser,"So, Ken, look, the Resource Review Plan is just that. It's a plan to ensure that we have sufficient resources allocated towards achieving a timely and sustainable compliance to the order. Essentially if an area is delayed or looking as if it could be, we'll determine what additional resourcing, if any, is required to get back on track and then we'll share that with the OCC in a more formalized way than we do today and we obviously review this pretty constantly ourselves. We're already working on the plan. After it's finalized with the OCC it will be confidential supervisory information that we can't disclose. So, we won't be able to tell you that the plan is, what the nature of the plan is going to be, but it won't be much more complicated than what we talked about. And we're expecting to get it, we're not expecting this to take long.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,Yes,occ,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Operator,The next question is from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Betsy Graseck,"Hi good afternoon. So, I know we talked a lot about expenses. I just have one kind of overarching question here, which is on how we should think about the path of expenses between now and the medium term, as we have come quite a long way in the simplification process. Maybe if you could give us a sense as to how far along simplification impact on expenses we are? And overlapping with the regulatory requirements, do these net out or are we skewed a little bit more towards regulatory requirements being a bit heavier than what's left on simplification from here? Thanks.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Mark Mason,"So, thank you, Betsy. I guess I'd say a couple things. So, I think we said it in the past. So, the target for the medium term, we think 2026 is somewhere around $51 billion to $53 billion of expenses. As we've said, we'll have about $1.5 billion in savings related to the restructuring that we've done and another $500 million to $1 billion related to net expense reductions from eliminating the stranded costs as well as additional productivity over that medium-term period. And so, we've made, I think, very good headway, as Jane has mentioned, in the org simplification and the restructuring charges associated with that. Those saves will have started to generate. Some of those saves in the early part of that, meaning this year, will likely be offset by continued investment that we're making in areas of the business like transformation, but also in business-led or driven growth. And you should expect in terms of the trend that we would have a downward trend towards 2026 in achieving that range.","billion, million",yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Jane Fraser,"And I just want to reiterate, we remain confident that we will meet our 11% to 12% RoTCE target over the medium term. And we've got the, we have the ability to manage the different elements we've been talking about today, making sure that we're investing sufficient resources into the transformation so we can be on track with that, as well as in our businesses, as well as the return of capital to our shareholders. So, we feel confident around that and good about it, we can manage this.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Mark Mason,"Yeah, I think that's a great point, Jane. Look, the reality is, as was pointed out earlier, we spent about $3 billion last year, a little bit under that, on the transformation-related work. And the plan has called for us to spend a little bit more than that this year. And frankly, in the first half of the year, as we work through the transformation work and some of the things that Jane and I have mentioned earlier in the year that we've been focused on, like data and data related to regulatory reporting, we've had to spend more than we had planned for in the first half, right, and we've done that and we funded that. We've been able to find productivity opportunities that allow for us to still stay within the guidance that we've given for the full year. So, we are managing this entire expense base, right, so not the whole $53 billion plus of it, we are actively managing that with an eye towards what's required from a transformation point of view to keep it on track, to accelerate in areas where we're behind and to shore up areas where we're tracking in accordance to what the order requires and where are the other inefficiencies that can allow for us to free up the expense base? And so, things like the work that Andy Sieg has done with the finance team around that expense base and finding efficiencies there are opportunities that we've been able to tease out of the business. Things that we have done in parts of USPB and that we have continued to get after in parts of Banking, which you see in the down 10% this quarter are areas where we've been keenly focused on, where are there duplicative roles, where are there inefficient processes that we can actually drive greater efficiency out of. So, longwinded way of saying, we understand the expense guidance that we've given, we also understand and stress the importance of funding the transformation with what's required and we're doing both.",billion,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Betsy Graseck,Okay. Great. Thank you very much. Appreciate that.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Operator,The next question is from Vivek Juneja with JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Vivek Juneja,"Hi. Let me just clarify this, Mark and Jane, just to make sure that we all have it right. The $53.5 billion to $53.8 billion does not include anything thus far on what you think you may need to spend on the Resource Review Plan, meaning what additional resources you would have to put to fix the consent order. Am I right there?",billion,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Jane Fraser,"No, you're not right. So, I think as you've heard us talk about, Vivek, for a while now, that we knew the areas that we were behind in elements of our transformation program and that we began addressing those and making the investments. Some of that's in people. Some of that is in technology spend. It's using different tools and capabilities to get areas addressed earlier and we began that earlier in the year and you saw that acknowledged as well by our regulators who pointed to the fact that we've already begun addressing the areas that we're behind. Mark?",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Mark Mason,"That's right, Jane, and what you have heard is that despite having to spend more, some $250 million or so more, we're not changing the guidance, right. And so, we have, as Jane mentioned, we have worked on areas already that we've needed to and we have looked for ways to absorb that and are doing so within our guidance.",million,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Vivek Juneja,"Okay. So, going forward, even though this plan is still to be sort of put together and approved by the regulators, we should not expect any change to this expense guidance?",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Mark Mason,"Look, the plan, the Resource Review Plan, as Jane mentioned, is what we're working through now with the regulators. That will be a process for demonstrating to them that we are spending and allocating the appropriate resources to accomplishing the commitments that we have. Appropriate resources can range from people to technology to enhancing our processes and ensuring better execution. If you think about what that will entail, it will entail areas where we are delayed or behind as we identify those areas, being able to tease out the root cause of any delay and ensure that we've got proper funding allocated to get it back on track and that's me framing out how I think about what something like this might look like. And so, what we're saying is that if we identify issues in the quarters to come, that we haven't identified already, that's the process we're going to apply to those issues. And as you've heard us say repeatedly, we're going to spend whatever is necessary to then get those things back on track. And as we've done thus far this year, we're going to look for opportunities to absorb those headwinds. I hope that's clear.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Operator,"The next question is from Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open. Please go ahead. : Hi. Apologies if I missed it in the opening remarks, but what drove the decline in credit card revenues from 1Q to 2Q?

2024,Q2,Jane Fraser,"I think if you look year-over-year, you'll be able to see a pretty common trend there. The consumer is slowing in some of the, in the spend, as Mark had referred to, Matt. And a lot of the spending and the growth areas we are seeing and underlying numbers is being driven by the affluent customer.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Mark Mason,"Yeah. I think there's also the dynamic on the CRS of the reward or across the portfolio of rewards playing through from one quarter to the other, so the combination of those things are playing through the revenue line there.",revenue,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Jane Fraser,"But nothing that's particularly worrying us, Matt. : Okay. And then just separately on the very early kind of part of the prepared remarks, you talked about the dividends being capped in terms of what could be upstream from the bank to the holding company because of the OCC that came out this week. For all intents and purposes, like does that impact how you run the company or subsidiary or impact liquidity or capital? I understood the comment, no change to dividends or buybacks at the holding company, but is there any impact from that that we would notice on the outside? Thank you.",liquidity,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,Yes,occ,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Jane Fraser,"Look, let's be clear, this action does not impact our ability to return capital to our shareholders. The dividends that are referenced are just intercompany payments from CBNA to the parent. So, first of all, don't confuse what a dividend is here. We will, it's not going to impact how we run the company, the subsidiary, the capital, the liquidity at all and the dividends are not capped.",liquidity,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Mark Mason,"Yeah, I think, Jane, that's right. And I think let's not lose sight of the purpose of the orders that are there and the purpose of the orders that are there are to ensure that we're funding and allocating the effort appropriately, right. So, the regulators want essentially the same thing we want, right, is for us to get this done, right, and so that is the primary objective. The reference to the dividending from out of CBNA up to the parent is certainly referenced there between now and establishing that Resource Review Plan. But as Jane mentions, that does not constrain the parent from doing the things that it will need to do. And as opposed to, it's not a cap. What it is, is that anything above the debt service of the parent or the preferred dividends and other nondiscretionary obligations would require a non-objection from the OCC.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,Yes,occ,No,,No,

2024,Q2,Saul Martinez,"Hi. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Just, I guess I just want to follow up on the latter question. I just want to be very clear. So, what you're saying is that the requirement that CBNA receive a non-objection before dividending upstream to the parent, that does not impact how you think about your capital flexibility, how you think about it doesn't restrict you in any way and shouldn't impact, for example, your ability to benefit from, for example, a Basel Endgame rule that is softened or some of the benefits, Mark, that you talked about in terms of simplification. So, you don't see this impacting your ongoing level of capital flexibility and your ability to repurchase stock going forward if some of these things actually do play out?",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,

2024,Q2,Mark Mason,Thank you.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Saul Martinez,"Second question on, I just want to follow up on USPB. I still I get the point that you're seeing a normalization in losses in Cards. But even if I adjust for reserve builds, your RoTCE is still single digits. I would think even at these NCL levels, your Cards business is pretty profitable. You're a scale player, you're above sort of pre-pandemic levels, but not I don't know if I, it doesn't seem like it's that much higher by a dramatic amount. It would seem to imply that the Retail Bank is a huge drag on profitability, even maybe even losing money, I don't know. But can you just talk about what you can do to sort of improve the Retail Bank profitability and just give anymore color that you can in terms of the path to get to that high-teen RoTCE you talked about?",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Jane Fraser,"Yeah, let me kick off there, and let's say, look, clearly, we're very focused on improving the returns in USPB to get us to the high-teens level over the medium term and you've seen us generating healthy positive operating leverage this quarter. We've had a number of quarters of good revenue growth. And as Mark said, we're at the low point of the credit cycle and we knew this year, we would see the pressure on returns from the elevated NCLs and some of the industry headwinds we've talked about. But as the NCL rates approach steady state levels and the mitigating actions that all of us have been putting in place against the industry headwinds, as those take hold, we expect the returns will improve and support the firm-wide medium-term targets. In the Retail Bank, we're continuing to focus on growing share in our six core markets and we're doing that, leveraging our physical and digital assets. It plays an important role in enabling the wealth continuum and the growth that we're looking at in our Wealth franchise. We're continuing to improve our operating efficiency, being very disciplined in expense management and managing carefully the branch and digital productivity of the Retail Bank network. But we're at the high point of the credit cycle. It's driving the low point for USPB, and as I said in my remarks, we're expecting to see those returns improve from here.",revenue,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,

2024,Q2,Steven Chubak,"Hi. Good afternoon. So, Mark, I have a fairly technical question on DTA utilization and specifically the NOLs. The deduction is still fairly significant at $12 billion. It roughly equates to about 10% of your market cap. And the good news here, I suppose, is that it should come back into capital over time, but we've seen very little utilization over the past two years despite the firm being profitable. And so wanted to better understand this, what's constraining your ability to utilize those DTAs and are there catalysts on the horizon that could help accelerate that utilization beyond organic earnings generation?",billion,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Mark Mason,"Yes. Thank you. So, I'm going to give you a very simple answer to a very complicated question. It really comes down to driving US income, right. And so, we are focused on not just all of the things that we've mentioned, but driving higher income in the US. That allows for us to utilize the disallowed DTA. We saw some of that in the quarter and we expect to see more of it as we move through the medium term, but that is the major driver of that utilization.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Jane Fraser,"And we have many of our business heads very much focused around that opportunity as well. So, winning in the US is a very important leg, for example, of the strategy that Vis is refreshing. Similarly, we see opportunities from the Commercial Bank. We see it in Wealth. We see it in, obviously in US Personal Banking and in Services. So, we're very, we're focused from a business strategy point of view on this, not just from the financial side.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Steven Chubak,"Thank you, both, for that color. Maybe just a quick follow-up just on the Retail Services business. We are seeing some evidence that your competitors in this space have been more aggressive leading with price in an effort to win some new mandates. And was hoping you could just speak to what you're seeing across the competitor set and your appetite or willingness to potentially offer better economics in response to increased competition from some of your peers.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Jane Fraser,"I think you'll be delighted to hear that we're very focused on returns rather than just on revenues. So, when we enter into discussions with a partner who may be a new RFP for their portfolio or looking at new ones such as the one we just agreed with Dillard's, it's all about the returns and the profile of the business rather than the revenue side of things. And it's a shift probably from some other ways in the past, but I'm very pleased with how disciplined the team is being around this and we're seeing the benefits of it.",revenue,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Mark Mason,"Yeah. And that may be different from what you hear and see from other players in the space. But as Jane mentioned, we're keenly focused on ensuring that, yes, we have a good partnership, but that we're generating an appropriate return. That's part of achieving our medium-term targets. And as you know, since you brought up Retail cards, I mean, when we think about how CECL works and the reserves you have to establish for these partnerships, we're establishing full, lifetime reserves that's on the balance sheet where ultimately we end up splitting those through the partner sharing economics. So, it's another important consideration as we think about expanding and taking on these relationships and renegotiating partnerships to making sure that returns make good sense for us.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Jane Fraser,Yeah. And Mark and I have no problem saying no to revenue that doesn't come at the right returns and being very disciplined around that.,revenue,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Operator,The next question is from Vivek Juneja with JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Vivek Juneja,"Hi. Sorry, just to follow up on this whole consent order stuff, Jane. What do you think this does in terms of timing, how much longer for you to sort of get this past you? Are you talking couple of years? Is it now longer by a year? Any sense of that? Any sense of helping us think through that?",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Jane Fraser,"Look, in terms of the consent order and the areas we've had delays, there are four areas to the consent order. It's risk management, it's data governance, it's around compliance and it's around control. As we've said, we were falling behind in certain areas related to data and we've been investing to address the areas that we were behind. We also saw an increase in the scope related to regulatory reporting, so we added some more bodies of work there and we're well underway. So, we are not expecting this to extend the original expectations that we have on when we will complete the body of work for the consent order. We have a target state for the different areas of it. We have the plan to achieve those target states. We'll make the investments necessary to ensure that we do so. We'll try and get this done as quickly, but as robustly as possible and we're doing this by making strategic fixes and investments rather than, what I would call, the old Citi way, which is a series of Band-Aids that remediate, but don't actually fix the underlying issue and that way, we are delivering for our shareholders as well as our regulators and our clients because we're putting in strategic solutions that will benefit all, but I'm not expecting this to change the timeframes.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Vivek Juneja,Thank you.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Operator,The final question comes from the line of Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Mike Mayo,"Hi. Just two clarifications. So, this is a very high-profile amendment to the consent order. And I think what I hear you saying that if you can confirm, your risk compliance and controls are getting passing grade. It's really the data and as it relates to the data, you're talking about 11,000 regulatory reports, some which had 750,000 lines of data. Is that really the scope of what you need to fix? Because people see this externally and say, hey, you're failing in terms of overall controls and resiliency. But I think I hear you saying it's really more about just the data and the regulatory reporting, which is important, but more of a slice of a broader picture. Is that correct?",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Jane Fraser,"Yeah, Mike, maybe I just maybe I you're asking a great and it's an important question, so maybe I try and explain what the data elements because it's an area that Mark and I have pointed to. So, first of all, we use data all over the firm. We use it to deliver 72 million customer statements every month. Our corporate clients, as you heard about at our Services Investor Day, access account data real-time across multiple countries on CitiDirect. And we're moving $5 trillion roughly per day for those clients around the world. We trade billions of dollars in a millisecond on our trading platforms. We can see our liquidity positions real-time around the world. This can only be done if you've got pretty pristine data and highly automated ecosystems. So, but what is the transformation doing? What it is doing is simplifying how data moves through the firm and it's about upgrading the management and governance over those flows. And as I've said, we're doing a strategic overhaul of large parts of our infrastructure, so what are we doing? We're making sure we're capturing data accurately using smart tools and automation. We'll often talk about this smart system, makes sure there's no errors when we book a trade. We've seen our error rate down 85% as a result of it. We're housing our upstream data in two standardized repositories, they're the golden sources, an in-person data hub which you've heard me talk about a few times and they're a golden source now for all of the downstream data use, populating the thousands of regulatory reports Mark talked about and other areas. And what a single repository means is that the data models, the data quality rules, the controls you put in place that govern and manage that data, they all sit in one place rather than being distributed all over the firm as they have been historically. Mark's been investing in building a standardized reporting infrastructure. You've heard us talk about a single full suite reporting ledger versus the six or so reporting ledgers that we had in the past. And we're delivering all of this through consolidated systems, through the automation and streamlining of data flows, so instead of being in multiple pipes, the flows go through single pipes. So, it's a, sorry to get a bit plumber on you for a moment, but I think it is important to understand what it is because it's a lot of work. It's a strategic overhaul. It's not a series of tactical fixes. Where we're behind, as we do the work on data, we identify specific issues we need to fix as we execute the plan that we have in place. There's some more areas to address than we knew back when we did the plan and we've also accelerated the work on improving the accuracy of our regulatory reports and we increased the scope of this work as well. It's more comprehensive than originally planned. So, what we're doing, we're adding resources and data experts. We're learning from best practices and we're using some great AI and other data tools that are helping to identify anomalies in data and data flows much more quickly. We're also, to some of the culture side, we're learning from pilots how do we accelerate broader deployment at scale across the firm in a consistent enterprise-wide manner. So, all of these things in the data side are going to enable us to leapfrog competitors, more revenue opportunities, better client service, fewer buffers, drive more efficiencies and hope at the end the end goal here is it becomes a competitive advantage for the firm. That is the data plan. Clearly, there's a very important element of it related to the consent orders. We're behind in a few areas. We're investing. We've already begun that investment, as Mark and I've talked about, to get it done. We'll get it done.","trillion, revenue, liquidity",yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Mike Mayo,"Yeah, just to say real short follow-up to that. So you're doing all this great stuff, but you still fell short, just in like one sentence, despite doing all of this great stuff that you described, the regulator still said you didn't get it done. Why, after doing all that, didn't you get it done in the eyes of the regulators and why will it be fixed now? Just like a one sentence explanation for that if you have it.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Jane Fraser,"I always said that a transformation of this magnitude over multiple years would not be linear. We have many steps forward. We have setbacks. We adjust, we learn from them, we move forward and we get back on track.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Mark Mason,"And Mike, if I could just put one number into context because you played back the 11,000, which was a number of global regulatory reports across the landscape here. There are probably 15 to 30 that are core US reports that are pivotal to our US regulators and a lot of what we're discussing here is about ensuring that we're prioritizing the data that impacts those 15 to 30 reports as we work through this.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Operator,There are no further questions. I will now turn the call over to Jenn Landis for closing remarks.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,

2021,Q3,Jennifer Landis,"Thank you, operator. Good morning. And thank you all for joining us. I'd like to remind you that today's presentation, which is available for download on our website, citigroup.com, may contain forward-looking statements which are based on management's current expectation and are subject to uncertainty and changes in circumstances. Actual results may differ materially from these statements due to a variety of factors, including those described in our SEC filings. Before we get started, I'd like to thank Liz Lynn for being such an incredible partner during these last few months. I really enjoyed getting to know the entire Citi team, and I'm honored to be the next Head of Investor Relations, and I look forward to working with you all. With that, I will turn it over to Jane.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q3,Jane Fraser,"So thank you, Jenn, and good morning, everyone. I'm delighted to join you today. So let's kick off the call with what we're seeing from a macro perspective and the tremendous engagement we continue to experience with clients before I give you an update on our results and priorities. Certainly, the recovery from the pandemic continues to drive corporate and consumer confidence. I particularly like the robust pipelines we see through the rest of the year and beyond. Corporate client sentiment remains very positive, with healthy cash flows and liquidity driving M&A activity and deleveraging. And consumer balance sheets remain unusually strong on the back of the increasing consumer net worth during the pandemic. Now all that said, growth has come off the boil a tad. We are watching three things very closely: the slowdown in China and its impact on global growth; inflation and supply constraints in labor, materials, and energy; and finally, what happens next with the US debt ceiling negotiations. These are also the issues which repeatedly surface in our conversations with clients. So, turning to the quarter. We reported net income of $4.6 billion and EPS of $2.15. Embedded in these results is a pre-tax loss related to the sale of our Australia consumer business, which Mark's going to provide the details on. Excluding this transaction, our third quarter revenues would have been up 3% over last year, and our EPS would have been $2.44. In the Institutional Clients Group, we grew revenues by 4% year-over-year, as we continue to see strong client engagement, with momentum in Investment Banking, Equity Markets and Securities Services, more than offsetting the 16% decline in Fixed Income Markets. I'm very proud to tell you that it was Citi's best M&A quarter and the second best Investment Banking quarter in a decade. And lending in the ICG grew again this quarter, albeit modestly. We also had a very strong quarter in Equity Markets with revenues up 40% year-over-year. So despite that normalization in Fixed Income versus the pretty extraordinary performance of 2020, overall markets revenues were only down 5%, and they were up 11% versus the third quarter of 2019. We continue to successfully execute on our strategy to grow fee revenue across the ICG businesses. For example, while TTS continues to be impacted by interest rate headwinds, our fees this quarter were the highest in a decade. You can also see how our global network uniquely positions us to help our clients navigate the supply chain challenges so many of them are facing, a dynamic that we expect to persist for the near future. Similarly, we drove double-digit fee revenue growth in Securities Services and the Private Bank, as client assets under custody and assets under management continued their vigorous growth trajectory. In Global Consumer Banking, healthy consumer balance sheets and persistently elevated payment rates did mean that loan growth remained under pressure. The other key drivers are a bit more encouraging, however. U.S. Branded Cards purchase sales are well above 2019 levels, and acquisitions across Branded Cards, Mexico, and the Asia hubs are also all now at or above pre-COVID levels. Similarly, we continue to benefit from double-digit growth in deposits and assets under management across the franchise. Let me briefly touch on our US retail strategy. Now, our digital strategy and investments are starting to pay dividends. Digital deposits stand at $19 billion, having grown 26% in the last year. And we see more than two- thirds of our digital deposit balances coming from customers outside of our branch footprint, with about half of those deposits from our cardholders who did not previously have a retail relationship with us. Now, obviously, we were disappointed by Google's decision to discontinue Google Plex, but we learned a lot through the effort, and the vast majority of the investments will be leveraged for our proprietary efforts and future partnerships. So all in all, we ended the quarter with a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 11.7% on a standardized basis, and our tangible book value per share increased to $79.07, up over 10% from a year ago. So far this year, we've returned close to $11 billion to shareholders through a healthy dividend and share repurchases. We remain committed to returning excess capital over and above the amount necessary to invest in our franchise and to maintain our safety and soundness. So overall, I'm quite pleased with these results given the environment we're operating in. And while we have much work ahead, we're seeing the results of the previous investments that we have made. Now, I'd like to update you on our strategic priorities. Turning to slide 3, we've included a page that clearly lays out our top priorities and some of the actions we've taken to date against them. And we're going to share this page with you each quarter to ensure you're up-to-date on where we are and the milestones and progress along the way. And as you can see, we've been hard at work acting against the priorities I've laid out: the transformation, the strategy refresh and our culture and talent. Now, clearly, the transformation is our number one priority right now. And key to that transformation is our safety and soundness and addressing the consent orders by modernizing our risk and control environment. During the quarter, we submitted our plans to our regulators and continue to have a constructive dialogue with them as we pivot now firmly towards execution. We're already well underway in the investment in our risk and control environment, and we are really bringing a culture of excellence to this effort, and we are moving with urgency. We also continued to make progress refreshing our strategy. In addition to announcing the sale of our consumer business in Australia, we're deep in the second round of bids for the remaining exit markets. We've begun the work on how these exits will enable us to simplify our operations in Asia and eliminate stranded costs. And we're really looking forward to bringing all the strategy work together for you on Investor Day and presenting our vision for the firm. And as Mark's going to touch on, we've begun executing on many of the decisions that we've already made, including in TTS, Wealth and Commercial Banking, with investments in front office hires, as well as enhanced digital product and service offerings. And we're already starting to see the impact of these investments emerge through key drivers across these businesses. And finally, turning to culture and talent. We continue to attract high-caliber external talent whilst driving towards our diversity goals, ensuring clear accountability and breaking down the silos that have historically impeded our progress as a company. It's a new Citi, and all of this work has one overarching goal: to responsibly narrow the returns gap with our peers. We will update you with the metrics and milestones that we'll use to hold ourselves accountable so you can hold us accountable to them as well. And with that, let me turn it over to Mark to go through our performance in more detail, and then we will both be delighted to take your questions.","capital ratio, billion, , revenue, net income, liquidity, loan growth",yes,Yes,"common equity tier 1, capital ratio, tier 1 capital",No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q3,Mark Mason,"Thank you, Jane, and good morning, everyone. Starting on slide 4. As Jane mentioned, Citigroup reported third quarter net income of $4.6 billion, EPS of $2.15 and an RoTCE of 11% on $17.2 billion of revenues. Embedded in these results is a pre-tax loss of $680 million related to the sale of our Australia consumer business. Excluding this item, EPS would have been $2.44 with an RoTCE of 12.5%. As a reminder, while we received a premium to book on the sale of the business, we did incur a pre-tax loss primarily related to the currency translation adjustment that has built up over time and is already included in our capital. Upon closing, the capital impact of this loss will be largely neutralized, and we will release approximately $800 million of capital allocated to the business. Revenues declined 1% from the prior year. Excluding the loss on sale, revenues would have been up 3%, largely driven by Investment Banking fees, as well as strong growth in Equity Markets and Securities Services. Expenses were up 5% year-over-year, and constant dollars expenses were up 4% in the quarter. On a year-to-date basis, our expenses have grown by 5% with two main drivers: investments in the transformation, including the six programs to address the consent orders, which drove about 3% of the growth so far this year; and business-led investments which focus on our front office expansion in the Investment Bank, Wealth and Securities Services and investments to improve our client experience and digitize our network. So far this year, we added over 500 bankers, advisors and other front office support in Wealth, including the Private Bank, and the Consumer Wealth businesses, and 200 corporate and investment bankers globally in high- growth areas, including senior hires across tech, healthcare, fintech, and private equity coverage. In our services businesses, TTS and Securities Services, we continue to improve client experience and digital capabilities, which is enabling us to capture significant new mandates. In consumer, these investments include development and marketing for new offerings like the Custom Cash card and installment lending, as well as investments in our mobile and digital user experience. In addition, there were also increases in volume and revenue-related expenses, as well as business-as-usual expenses which were largely offset by efficiency savings. As a reminder, we will continue to analyze our expenses to look for opportunities to self-fund investments. And now turning to credit. Credit performance remains strong, with net credit losses of just under $1 billion, more than offset by an ACL release of $1.2 billion, largely reflecting continued improvement in portfolio quality. In constant dollars, end-of-period loans were down 1% year-over-year, reflecting the impact of the Australia exit. Excluding this impact, loans would have been up 1% year-over-year, driven by active client engagement in TTS, Private Bank and Markets. End-of-period deposits were up 6% year-over-year, reflecting continued engagement with our consumer and corporate clients, as well as continued momentum in client acquisition and deepening across both corporate clients and consumers. Finally, as Jane noted earlier, we returned roughly $11 billion in capital so far this year, and while we remain committed to continuing to invest in our franchise, we will continue to return excess capital to shareholders. Turning now to each business. Slide 5 shows the results for the Institutional Clients Group. Revenues increased 4% year-over-year and sequentially, mainly driven by Investment Banking, Equity Markets and Securities Services. Expenses increased 9%, with about half of the increase driven by transformation and the other half driven by business-led investments and higher revenue-related costs, partially offset by efficiency savings. Credit costs were largely benign in the quarter, as minimum net credit losses were more than offset by an ACL reserve release. This resulted in net income of $3.4 billion, which grew 21% in the quarter and 60% on a year-to-date basis. And ICG delivered an RoTCE of 14.5% for the quarter and 18.8% year-to-date. Slide 6 shows revenues for the Institutional Clients Group in more detail. On the Banking side, revenues were up 11%. In Treasury and Trade Solutions, continued growth in fee revenues of 20% year-over-year, the highest quarter for fees in a decade, reflected solid client engagement and client acquisition, as well as a recovery in commercial card revenues. However, all of this was more than offset by the impact of lower deposit spreads, driving total revenues down 4%. We're continuing to see momentum across our payment business, with 15% growth in cross-border flows and 10% growth in clearings transactions over the past year. As of quarter-end, TTS loans grew 15%, mainly in trade loans where our technology investments in supply chain and deep local knowledge are enabling us to meet our clients' needs across the globe. Investment Banking revenues were up 39% year over-year, largely driven by M&A, as we continue to see the benefits from our front office investments, which positioned us well to take advantage of increased deal activity. As Jane mentioned, this was the second best quarter for Investment Banking revenues and the best quarter for M&A in a decade. Private Bank revenues grew 4%, driven by growth in assets under management, loans and deposits, reflecting momentum with new and existing clients. This quarter, we added almost 200 bankers, investment counselors and other front office support, and onboarded over 200 new clients. Our investments in talent continue to drive growth, which bodes well for our overall strategy in Wealth. Corporate Lending revenues were up 17%, primarily driven by lower cost of funds and a modest gain on sale, partially offset by lower loan volumes. Total Markets and Securities Services revenues decreased 4% from last year. Fixed Income revenues decreased 16%, reflecting the continued normalization in market activity across rates and spread products. However, we saw strong activity with our corporate clients, engaging with them in foreign exchange products to support their global operations and hedging solutions to assist with their risk mitigation efforts. Equity Markets revenues were up 40%, our second best quarter in a decade, driven by cash equities, derivatives and prime finance, reflecting solid client activity and favorable market conditions. This is another business where we see our investments in talent and technology paying off. In Securities Services, revenues were up 10%. Here we saw strong growth in fee revenues as the investments that we've been making in our platform and product capabilities enabled us to grow revenue with both new and existing clients, partially offset by lower deposit spreads. Finally, looking at year-to-date results in ICG, we've seen a strong contribution from Investment Banking and Equity Markets, as well as solid results in the Private Bank and Securities Services, which help to offset the expected normalization in Fixed Income Markets. Turning now to the results for Global Consumer Banking in constant dollars on slide 7. Revenues declined 14% and 5% excluding the loss on sale, as solid deposit growth and momentum in investment management were more than offset by lower card balances and lower deposit spreads. Expenses increased 5%, with about half driven by transformation and the remainder driven by business-led investments and volume related expenses, partially offset by efficiency savings. Cost of credit was a modest benefit this quarter, as a roughly $1 billion ACL reserve release more than offset net credit losses. This resulted in net income of $1.3 billion, which grew 44%. And GCB delivered a 15% RoTCE and a 21.5% RoTCE excluding the loss on sale. Finally, looking at year-to-date results, we've seen steady improvement in our drivers over the course of the year, with purchase sales up 5% relative to 2019 and acquisitions nearing pre-COVID levels globally. And the business delivered 22.4% RoTCE excluding the loss on sale. Slide 8 shows the results for North America Consumer in more detail. Total third quarter revenues were down 4% from last year as we continue to see headwinds from higher payment rates and deposit spreads. That said, we are encouraged by the trends we are seeing in both Cards and Retail Banking. In Branded Cards and Retail Services, purchase sales were up versus the prior year by 24% and 14%, respectively, with both above 2019 levels. And in Retail Banking, average deposits and within that, checking deposits, were both up 14%. AUMs were up 16%, and Citigold households were up 13% this quarter. We're also making progress on our US digital strategy. US digital deposits grew 26% compared to the prior year. And installment loan balances, including our Flex Loan and Flex Pay products have also grown substantially, up 22% compared to the prior year, and over 80% of these loans are originated digitally. On slide 9, we show results for our international consumer banking in constant dollars. Revenues declined 30% year-over-year in the third quarter. Excluding the loss on sale, revenues declined 5%, with a 7% decline in Latin America and a 4% decline in Asia. Looking at international consumer overall, we're seeing good momentum in investment management, with 10% growth in assets under management, primarily driven by Asia, and the growth is meaningfully higher if you look specifically at the four international wealth hubs. Purchase sales grew 8% versus the prior year, and average deposits grew 3%, albeit at lower deposit spreads. Slide 10 provides additional detail on Global Consumer credit trends. Credit remains favorable again this quarter across all regions. And given the delinquency trends we're seeing today, we do not expect credit deterioration in the US portfolio in 2021. Slide 11 shows the results for Corporate/Other. Revenues increased by over $300 million, driven by higher net revenue from the investment portfolio. Expenses declined by $300 million due to the absence of the civil money penalty which we incurred in the third quarter of last year, offset by an increase in expenses related to the transformation. Credit costs were still a benefit in the quarter but reflect the lower ACL release in the legacy portfolio relative to last year. Finally, EBT was a loss of $330 million. Slide 12 shows our net interest revenue and margin trends, as well as noninterest revenues on a reported basis. In the third quarter, net interest revenue of $10.4 billion declined roughly $100 million year-over-year, reflecting lower loan balances and the impact of lower rates. On a year-to-date basis, net interest revenue declined by roughly $2.3 billion. Turning to noninterest revenues on the bottom of the slide, in the third quarter, non-NIR declined by approximately $50 million year-over-year, driven by the impact from the loss on the sale of the Australia consumer business. Excluding the loss, noninterest revenues would have grown by over $600 million or 9%, driven by strong growth in fees in ICG. On slide 13, we show our key capital metrics. Our CET1 capital ratio ticked down to 11.7%. During the quarter, Citi returned a total of $4 billion to common shareholders in the form of $1 billion in dividends and share repurchases of $3 billion. Our supplementary leverage ratio was largely unchanged at 5.8%. And our tangible book value per share grew by 10% year-over-year to $79.07, driven by net income. Before we move to Q&A, let me touch briefly on our outlook for 2021. On the top line, for total Citigroup, we still expect revenues to be down in the mid-single-digit range on a reported basis, excluding any divestiture related impacts. On the expense side, we continue to expect full-year expenses to be up in the mid-single digit range, excluding any divestiture-related impacts, as we continue to transform our risk and control environment and invest in our businesses. And we will continue to look for ways to partially self-fund these investments over time. With that, Jane and I would be happy to take your questions.","capital ratio, billion, , revenue, net income, million, cet1",yes,Yes,"cet1, capital ratio",No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,Yes,leverage ratio
2021,Q3,"Question And Answer

2021,Q3,John Mcdonald,"Mark, I wanted to ask about the net interest income. It seems like overall it came in a little bit better than you might have expected when you spoke at the Barclays Conference in September. Can you give us a little more color on what drove the improvement in the core ex-Markets NII this quarter and how that makes you feel about the setup for NII growing from here.",net interest income,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q3,Mark Mason,"Sure. Good morning, John. When we look at, it's on page 12, we came in at about $10.4 billion. I think there were a couple factors that play through here. One were the treasury investments that we've been making contributed to that as we put some of the excess liquidity that we have to work. The second, I mentioned earlier that we saw some loan growth in cards sequentially, Branded Cards in particular, up 3%. But also, within that, we saw some of the late fees and balcon fees in cards kind of play through. As you know, there's an extra day in the quarter. And so, the combination of those things contributed to the tick-up here that we've seen. In terms of kind of the balance of the year, that all feeds into the guidance that I've given for total revenues. And that really hasn't changed. But we continue to look to invest in the Cards portfolio through new acquisitions with the long-term perspective of how we grow loans over time there.","billion, loan growth, liquidity",yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q3,John Mcdonald,"Okay. And just as a follow-up, on capital returns, while your total return is very healthy, it doesn't look like it increased much from the $4 billion that you did in the second quarter despite the Fed lifting its restrictions. Is this something you're being conservative on, given a lot of change going on at the company right now? Or as you free up capital from the business exits, your stock is trading at a low valuation, how are you thinking about allocating that freed-up capital between investing in the business and returning it to shareholders?",billion,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,

So, look, our philosophy really has not changed on this in terms of you've heard me say a number of times that as we generate income, as we utilize our DTA over time, as capital gets released from the transactions that we do, we want to ensure that we're able to serve our clients. We want to ensure that we can invest in the business. And then anything in excess of that, we want to return to shareholders. So that perspective has not changed. Obviously, the SCB allows for us to take those decisions in the given quarter based on what we're seeing in terms of our expected performance and based on all of the other factors I mentioned, including the capital release in SA-CCR and things of that sort. And so, we'll continue to take those decisions with that philosophy in mind, which is how do we return any excess we have to shareholders over time.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q3,John Mcdonald,Okay. Thank you.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q3,Operator,Your next question will come from Glenn Schorr with Evercore.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q3,Glenn Schorr,"Hi. Two interesting things – wonder if we'd get your quick comments on perspective. One was, you became the first custodian to receive regulatory approval in onshore custody business in China. I wonder if you could frame perspective on how material that opportunity is. And then the same kind of thing on your plans to enter the Australian Buy Now, Pay Later market and what that means for not just Australia but more globally, how you're viewing that in connection with the rest of your consumer business. Thanks so much",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q3,Jane Fraser,"Thanks, Glenn. So, why don't I take that one. In terms of our operations and business in China, I'd say, we've been in that country for 100 years. We understand the dynamics in the local market well. We're currently serving a very large number of investors in that market, 70% of the Fortune 500 corporates in China, how they operate on the ground and gain access to China's capital markets. And we're looking at – we're very happy to have custody license in China. It will also help support our operations in Hong Kong, and it's part of the growth of our Securities Services strategy that we've got. You've seen the benefits starting to flow through in this quarter's results from some of those previous investments. And this is just another one of the investments that we're making in that business that we like a lot and we think we're well positioned in. And in terms of Buy Now, Pay Later, I think this is one where obviously we're divesting our operations in Asia on that front, but we've certainly taken – we've taken the learnings from our operations throughout the Asian region, particularly been applying them to the US over the last few years. So, we've certainly not been sitting still in the US. We've been building out our personal lending platform since 2019. And that's part of our broader digitization strategy in US consumer. We've been seeing very strong growth in our Flex portfolios, both as we leverage some of our existing partnerships such as American Airlines and we work to expand with new partners in POS. And one of the areas I'm particularly excited about is the partnering that we're doing with the largest e-commerce player, Amazon, on point-of-sale lending for our cards customers. And those capabilities are and will be leveraged with many additional partners and channels in the States and into Mexico. And finally, we've been expanding our product suite by developing off-card lending capabilities. And I think, as you've heard from Mark, our payments on installment loans to existing card customers, 88% of those total sales are in digital channels. So as we look at all of this, I would say, clearly, there's a trend towards multiple different formats of how a customer can and wants to pay, and we're really on the front foot of this and making some strong progress on the back of the investments that we've been making over the last few years, and we'll continue to do so.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q3,Operator,Your next question will come from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q3,Betsy Graseck,Hi. Good Morning.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q3,Mark Mason,Good Morning.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q3,Betsy Graseck,"Wanted to understand a little bit more about what you think you can do in the US cards business. I know we just spoke a little bit about some of the things that you have been executing on, but when I look at the card business, while it's up on a year-on-year basis, it is trending a bit below some of the peers in terms of growth rates. And then you've got the retail partner card program which has some opportunities there to, in my opinion, get a little bit of a refresh to be as dynamic as some of your best-in class peers. So wondering how you're thinking about that. And as well on the deposit side in the US with Google now – partnership not going forward, what are you thinking about with regard to leveraging your mobile app across the US in a way that might not be understood well by the investor community? Because it seems like you've got a great app and it's just under-penetrating your opportunity set with your brand.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q3,Mark Mason,"Thanks, Betsy. Betsy, why don't I get started and Jane may want to jump in. And I'll start with kind of your comments related to cards. And so, look, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, particularly when you look at US Branded Cards, we did start to see a tick-up there as it relates to loan balances. The loans were up about 1% year-over-year. They were up about 3% quarter-over-quarter. What I think is really important here is the market re-entry because as you're seeing, purchase sales are up but payment rates are still quite high. And we've got to see how stimulus and liquidity plays out over time. And so, what we're focused on is how we're re-entering into the market. And we're doing that both through our Custom Cash launch, which is helping to drive new acquisitions. In fact, our new acquisition volumes are back to 2019 levels. Over half of those acquisitions are in proprietary cards. We're being thoughtful about that. So over the last five years, we've been shortening our promotional periods and adding higher fees for balance transfers and targeting a lower mix of promotional balances. And those things, as you know, will feed future average interest earning balances, as our experience is that roughly half of those balances ultimately convert to revolving over time. So, that's an important step. The second thing that I'll mention is, just to reiterate what Jane pointed out, which is we're thinking about lending more broadly. And we're driving growth on card lending products like Flex Pay and Flex Loan. And those don't have promotional periods associated with them, and they start to generate interest from day one. And so, we're keenly focused on this. We're obviously a big player here. It's obviously an important part of our portfolio and generates healthy returns. But we need to be positioned to capture growth as the economy continues to recover and behavior normalizes, and we need to be prepared if behavior doesn't normalize as quickly as we'd like with things like broader lending products.",liquidity,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q3,Operator,Your next question will come from Jim Mitchell with Seaport Research.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q3,Jim Mitchell,"Hey. Good morning. My question maybe just focused a little on rates. I think we're so focused on US rates, but given your global exposure, we've seen rate hikes in Mexico, Brazil, now we're contemplating rate hikes soon in the UK. How do we think about your rate sensitivity to the rest of the world? And do you see some benefits coming up over the next few quarters on the NII side?",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q3,Mark Mason,"Yeah. Look, I mean, we have seen a number of rate hikes and then the talk of rate hikes here in the US. As you look at kind of our IRE that we report, we're not that sensitive to the short end or long end. But that said, rate increases are beneficial for us. And so, we are – we've got a lot of liquidity that's available for us to invest as we see rates increase but, also, have enough dry powder to ensure that we're taking advantage of client demand as that starts to return as well. But for our firm, as you pointed out, the global impact to rates is quite important and increases internationally help to fuel our performance in parts of the franchise like TTS and elsewhere.",liquidity,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q3,Operator,Your next question comes from Ken Usdin with Jefferies.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q3,Ken Usdin,"Hey. Good morning. Mark, thanks for your update on just the reiterated cost guide for this year. And I know probably too early to talk about next year, but can you just help us understand just the moving parts underneath incentive comp transformation and what we should be thinking about in terms of just run rate costs from here. If we can even stay away from just kind of like what next year growth looks like. But any color, the question is coming up a lot for sure across the large bank group in terms of acquired investments versus other things going on at the bank. Thanks.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q3,Mark Mason,"Yeah, sure. So, look, let me start by saying, as I pointed out in prepared remarks, our expenses in aggregate are on guidance, so to speak, both as it relates to the transformation expected spend which year-to-date is up 3%, as well as our total expenses which are up 5% year-to-date, again consistent with the guidance. As I think about this, those are two very important categories of spend. As Jane has pointed out, transformation is our top priority and we're going to spend what's necessary to get that done. And we need to ensure that we're investing long term across the franchise. And so, we're going to continue to do that. But I would also highlight that expenses is something that we control, right? So, we are very deliberate about the spend that you're seeing. And in fact, I'm scrubbing, we are scrubbing every single expense line that we have, right, to ensure that the dollars that we're putting to work are being put to work in an optimal fashion, that they're necessary dollars to be spent. And in doing that, we're also looking for productivity and efficiency opportunities. And in fact, we've seen that play through the expense levels that you see today. If you look at – if we – as we look at our expenses, we've generated somewhere between $300 million and $400 million a quarter in efficiencies through 2021, right? So expense management is something that we're very disciplined about, we're very deliberate about, and we handle that in a very controlled fashion, recognizing the priorities that we pointed out. I'm not going to give you guidance for 2022. I will tell you that our guidance hasn't changed for the balance of 2021. We're obviously in the middle of our budget season, right? And as we firm that up and finalize that, we'll share that with you and our investors more broadly.",million,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q3,Operator,Your next question will come from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q3,Mike Mayo,"Hi. My question is for Jane. Jane, you said on this call it's a new Citigroup. And I'm just referring to the 8-K from August where it announced a bonus scheme for top executives. Apparently, that will be broadened out to many more. And so, we as shareholders and those who represent shareholders, we see this bonus scheme before we see the targets. So, I guess my question is, do you have the targets? And if so, can you reveal those? Although I suspect that won't be until March 2nd. Or do you not have targets yet or what's happening? Because either way, it doesn't feel good for us investors. Thanks.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q3,Jane Fraser,"Oh. Well, Mike, I'm actually really glad you brought this up, as we obviously saw your note the other day. If you bear with me for a minute, let's just take a step back and start with our compensation philosophy because I think it's really important for our shareholders to understand this. So the compensation of the management team is designed to be performance based. It's aligned with the interest of our shareholders most importantly. So, first, any of the deferred awards we have downside built in, and we clearly saw this last year in the PSU performance, which paid out only 28% of its target. And then secondly, the annual process holds management accountable for our results, as we also saw last year with meaningful comp reductions resulting from the consent orders. So then, if we then turn to the transformation program. As I said in the opening, there isn't anything that's more important than the successful execution of the program. It's our number one priority. We want to make sure the bank is modernized in its risk and control environment and it will also benefit our shareholders in terms of the performance of the bank. The board and I hold the senior leaders driving that transformation accountable for its successful execution. I'm certainly driving this program with urgency. And I also need to retain key talent because it's a pretty tight talent market right now, as we all know. And we need to do this so that we can hit the milestones and to deliver with excellence. So to hold people accountable and drive the outcomes, we need both carrots and we need sticks. And to your question, we're going to put in rigorous metrics to determine if the rewards get paid out at all and, if so, what percentage will be paid out. And we laid out the criteria in the 8-K, and the final metrics will be ones that reflect input from the board, from myself, and the other stakeholders involved. And we'll make – and those were obviously disclosed in the proxy, et cetera. So you'll see them. So as you can see, I think, the main message from me is there will be consequences if we fall short of what is expected, just as there were last year for the management and the leaders of the program. I'm accountable. My team is accountable. And very simply, we must and we will deliver.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q3,Operator,Your next question will come from Ebrahim Poonawala with Bank of America.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q3,Ebrahim Poonawala,"Good morning. I just wanted to, Jane, go back to, you mentioned disappointment at Google Plex pulling out. Just talk to us in terms of, did you view that as a critical client acquisition tool? And given that that's not moving forward, does that put some urgency in terms of other partnerships that you may strike to improve sort of the deposit gathering efforts?",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q3,Jane Fraser,"Yes. As I – obviously, as I said in the opening, we were disappointed in their decision. But it is just one part of our digital strategy. We certainly didn't have all the eggs in that basket, as we've been talking about for a few quarters now. And what I am pleased is the strength of the digital engagement that we are seeing across the US, it's lagged other geographies around the world across the industry on this dimension, and also the growth in sticky digital deposits that we're seeing in the US. The piece I like is we deliberately invested in very reusable capabilities for future partnerships and existing ones that we have, as well as our own proprietary efforts. So if I can try and make that comment a bit alive. We've added 80 APIs, which really make it very easy to operate with partners. We've developed a whole suite of embedded services that are ready to deploy. That's things like real-time digital alerts, partner branded communications. And probably most importantly, maybe this is the geek in me, we put together new tech stacks and we've learned a lot about doing this. But it's very valuable for what we're doing right now and for partnerships going forward. So at the end of the day, I think all the things that we've been doing, both in some of the work with Google but also with partnerships around the world, is going to further our digitization strategy in US consumer, continue helping us grow and drive the returns here. And, I would say, we're always feeling urgency in improving the performance, the growth and returns in consumer franchises. Thank you.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,

2021,Q3,Connor,So you submitted a plan to the regulators this quarter. Can you just give us a sense of when you expect to hear back from them and then what kind of things you'll be able to communicate to all of us. I know there's always limited abilities in what you can discuss about the regulatory stuff. But what are some of the data points that you're looking for internally and what – and when do you think you can share?,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q3,Jane Fraser,"Yes. I mean, I think, as you heard from me, this is our number one priority. I think it's for the benefit of all of our stakeholders that we get this done with excellence and we get this done right. And as we said, we submitted our plan in the third quarter. I'm personally very proud of it. It is a multiyear plan. As Mark said, it comprises six major programs, and it will position us to operate with excellence in the years ahead in a digital world. And in particular, it provides very clear target stakes for our risk and controls and for our core operating model elements. As we've said, we've now firmly pivoted to executing that plan. And I have to say, we have a very constructive and frankly a really helpful dialogue that's been ongoing with our regulators. So, it's not as if you submit and then you haven't spoken. This has been very constructive all the way through. In terms of execution, we're kind of going full steam ahead here. I'm really pleased with the caliber of talent we've brought in from inside and outside of the firm, as Mark talked about, so we can ensure that we're executing with excellence. Some of the areas are new hires in data. And I think, importantly, we're putting as much effort on culture as on modernization. Karen Peetz and her team are ensuring we have the capabilities and rigorous governance, so we're executing in a very disciplined way. We deliver the outcomes from the investments we're making. We put in a new accountability framework. And I have to say, our board is certainly holding us firmly and regularly to account. So, we'll be sharing more details obviously at Investor Day and as we go through this, but I think the main message from me is we pivoted to execution and we're getting on with this.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,

2021,Q3,Vivek Juneja,"Hi, Jane. Just wanted to clarify on this compensation 8-K that you talked about. You obviously have – you've always had bonuses for short-term and you've had long-term incentive comp that you always paid your executives, similar to everybody else. So the transformation project seems to be over and above that. Shouldn't that be part of what long-term compensation and incentive awards are meant for? I'm trying to understand what the logic behind adding an additional payment here is, because that's what management has already been partly compensated for, which is longer-term moves and changes in performance.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q3,Jane Fraser,"Look, I think it's exactly as I – well, first of all, thank you. Thank you, Vivek. I think as I said earlier in answer to Mike's questions, we want to drive the program with urgency. We need to retain key talent, and it is a very tight talent market, as you know. And I want to make sure that the – that there's no question from anyone involved in these – in the programs that this is their number one priority for the bank to execute this with excellence. But there are both carrots and sticks here, and those come through the individual program and the individual assessments that everyone participates in every year, as well as in this piece. So, I think this is fully aligned with the shareholders' interest. You want to have management really incented to deliver this with excellence but equally with all the downsides if we fail to do so. And the program is designed to do just that.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,

Thank you.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,

2021,Q3,Operator,Your next question is from the line of Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q3,Mike Mayo,"Hi. Just wanted to follow up again, a follow-up to my other question and as Vivek expressed. Jane and Mark, you've mentioned that you have to serve regulators, number one. I think that's clear to everybody on this call. And then you mentioned serving stakeholders. But I think the question really gets to what's being done for shareholders? And shareholders have been left behind at Citigroup over almost any timeframe. And, Mark, maybe I might disagree with the philosophy a little bit and your philosophy set is first serve clients, then invest in the business, then you do buybacks. Why should you have any change in your philosophy is because the discount to book value is just getting greater and greater. Your discount versus peer has increased. Citi has worst-in-class returns, adjusted efficiency and stock market valuation. So why not a little change in that philosophy to more buybacks versus investing if you have such a great opportunity with your share price? So what can you do from a symbolic nature, like, everyone gets paid in stock? Or what can you do about the capital freed up from the sale of Australia and use all that to buy back stock? Or what can you do to show that, obviously regulators matter, stakeholders matter, but what can you do to show that shareholders also matter given such the underperformance of the share price? And then, since you're only giving one question at a time, just a little bit more follow-up on your US consumer strategy as far as digital deposits, cross-selling to credit cards, point of sale with Amazon, a little bit more on that. Thank you.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q3,Jane Fraser,"Okay. Mike, it's Jane, let – obviously. Let me kick this one off. Unequivocally, our shareholders are incredibly important to us. And when we look at where we're trading and the underperformance around that, it is something that we are determined in the strategy refresh, in the transformation work we're doing, and in the culture and talent work we're doing to address this. We're going to do what is necessary to narrow the gap with our peers. We're going to ensure we have the right business mix and strategies to drive up the returns, and you're starting to see where that is – where we're headed to with that from the different decisions we've already announced. And obviously, it will all come together on Investor Day. But secondly, we're also going to do it by running the bank better. And we've laid out on page 3 of the presentation what are the different priorities so that our investors realize the value that we think lies in Citi and what we are going to be doing to unlock that for their benefit. And I think it – I hope it's pretty clear in terms of the framework that we're using and the principles around that. And in terms of, as Mark said, from a – not only unlocking the value that we see in Citi, which I really do think is pretty tremendous and I'm quite excited about, it's also then what will we do with our excess capital. You've heard me say, given where we trade, so disappointingly below book, obviously, share repurchases make sense for our shareholders. We also do have a healthy dividend yield, but that's an important part of the mix. But there's no question around the attractiveness for shareholder relatively of the stock buybacks. And we will certainly be returning excess capital to our shareholders and be very mindful of the bar that is required for investment internally. And you've seen that with the decisions that we've made on the exits in Asia on consumer and some of the other moves, that we will exit the businesses we think are lower returning and reinvest where appropriate. But we'll return that to shareholders. And I can see my CFO is champing at the bit here to jump in as well.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q3,Mark Mason,"Yeah. Thanks. And I just – I think you answered it very well, I'll just add a couple of quick things. One, that when we invest in the business towards clients or more broadly in the business, we're doing it where returns are above our cost of capital. So we're making smart decisions about how to redeploy that capital to ensure that we're narrowing that gap to peers. The second thing I'd point out is that in the first couple of quarters of the year, we've maxed out the capital return that was available for us to deliver before the SCB came into play, and that is because our shareholders are so important. And then the third, as Jane mentioned, is that we have a skew towards buybacks, again, just given where the stock is trading and given where our dividend yield is. So thank you for the question.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q3,Operator,Your final question is from the line of Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q3,Steven Chubak,"Hey. Thanks for squeezing me in here. Good morning, Jane and Mark. Jane, I was hoping to just ask on the wealth management opportunity. This is an area where we have great competitive intensity. You have a large – many large peers have been investing heavily in this space for years. And I know you're going to cover some of this at Investor Day and provide more detail, but just at a high level, I was hoping you could speak to what differentiates Citi's value prop from some of the peers in the space, whether you have the technology or infrastructure in place to support some of your growth ambitions. And then just lastly, whether you can engage in M&A or is that precluded under the consent order if you were to look to expand into that arena inorganically.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q3,Jane Fraser,"Yeah. Thank you so much, Steven. So, I'm pretty pleased around our opportunities here because we have all the pieces to be very successful. We have a strong brand in – amongst the affluent, not just here in the states off our Retail Banking franchise, we've got a very – we've got a pretty heavily affluent base, but around the world and when you go into Asia, in particular, this is the aspirational wealth management brand on the ground there. We've also got real breadth of client relationships, and this is where the connectivity points also become important in those four principles that we laid out for the strategy refresh. We have commercial banking operations in 30 geographies around the world that have been operating for many years now. This is the engine of wealth creation in the world, and we have the relationship with the owners already. so the synergies that we will be able to generate by much more closely connecting them will be very important. Similarly, the elevator from the affluent client base in our consumer franchise, all the way up to the ultra-high net worth in the Private Bank is obviously a natural area to build out that we haven't really invested in that elevator and thinking of it that way. We have a great – we have some great platforms. Our Institutional Clients business around the world means that we've got top two platforms for our private banking clients, in particular, to take advantage of, but it's also ones that our consumer clients have as well. So the opportunity here is to bring all these different pieces together into a single integrated offering across the full spectrum of clients in the US and in the global offshore wealth centers. And I would also point the fact that we're already the top three player in Asia. It's not as if we don't have scale and that this is a start-up business here. And we're already seeing that this is coming into fruition quickly. We obviously announced the focus on Wealth at the beginning of the year. We've already acquired 21,500 new-to- bank clients in Asia so far this year, that we've added over 500 bankers, advisors and other front office support year-to-date. We've done one of the biggest tech releases for Wealth in the third quarter of this year, with over 70-plus features going live on the back of the digital platform we launched last quarter. So, I think the fact that we've got all these different pieces, we're putting them all together, is really giving us momentum and accelerating the opportunity for us. And this is a trend. The Wealth trend is going to be one that is one of those unstoppable trends, particularly in Asia in the years ahead. We'll look at acquisitions at the moment. Obviously, it's more focused around what are digital capabilities, what are other things to enhance the value propositions and the technological side. And those aren't just acquisitions, it's partnerships and the like that we've been investing in so that we really serve the wealthy clients across the full spectrum of their needs rather than just narrowly as some of the other players are in just the sort of investment products. We've got the benefit across the board.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,

2022,Q3,Jane Fraser,"Thank you, Jenn, and thanks everyone for joining us today. Well, we are certainly still living through interesting times. And overall, I am pleased with how our bank is navigating through them. As you'll hear from me shortly, we continue to focus intensely on executing our strategy and our transformation as we outlined at Investor Day, whilst supporting our clients in this complex environment. So before I get into the quarter, let me highlight some observations about what we see going on around the world, given our unique vantage point. The global macro outlook that we shared with you over the last couple of quarters has been borne out. There is accumulating evidence of slowing global growth, and we now expect to experience rolling country level recession starting this quarter. The severity and timing of these recessions depend where in the world you are. Although persistently high inflation is driving a global softening of consumer demand for goods. In the Eurozone and the U.K., the supply shocks are most severe. Growth prospects have deteriorated sharply, and headline inflation is running at nearly 10%. All eyes are on this winter's weather forecast and the energy supply. The U.S. economy, however, remains relatively resilient. So while we are seeing signs of economic slowing, consumers and corporates remain healthy as our very low net credit losses demonstrate. Supply chain constraints are easing, the labor market remains strong, so it is all a question of what it takes to truly tame persistently high core inflation. Now history would suggest that, that will be quite a lot and for some time. Therefore, we could well see a mild recession in the second half of '23. We believe the U.S. economy is well positioned to withstand it all else being equal in the geopolitical arena, that is. Finally, in Asia, we continue to be concerned with China's COVID lockdowns, which took a bigger bite out of economic activity than anticipated, exacerbated by a lack of intensified macro stimulus. It is geopolitical risks and rates that dominate discussions with our corporate clients worldwide. And I'd say we're more focused on market liquidity generally and counterparty risk than our credit risk in the near term. Nonetheless, we are planning conservatively, and we are prepared for all environments. Against this backdrop, today, we reported net income of $3.5 billion, EPS of $1.63 and an RoTCE of 8.2%. We grew revenues by 6%, including a gain on sale of our consumer business in the Philippines. While we had excellent performance in some areas, our results could have been better in a few others. Services delivered another very strong quarter. TTS saw revenues up 40% year-over-year with growth in each business and in fees. Key drivers of our strategy such as wallet share, trade loan originations and cross border transactions are all trending strongly in the right direction and are ahead of our plan. Securities Services was up 15%, despite assets under custody being impacted by the declines in equity markets. We have onboarded over $1 trillion in AUC and AUA since the beginning of the year and we're seeing good momentum in issuer services, in particular. Markets, on the other hand, came in lower with revenues down 7%. In fixed income, we matched last year's particularly good showing through our long standing strength in FX, offsetting a weaker quarter in spread products. In equities, reduced activity in derivatives, which is a core part of our platform, led to lower revenues compared to last year's exceptional performance. And we continued to optimize RWA in markets, consistent with our strategy. Banking was the business most adversely impacted by the macro environment across the industry, with geopolitics and fears of recession significantly reducing deal flows and the appetite for M&A. We continue to invest in building out our teams for long-term growth opportunities, including health care, technology and energy. And I'm really pleased with the high caliber of bankers who are attracted to both our platform and our culture. The environment for wealth management continued to be less than ideal. Our revenues were down only slightly and meaningfully up outside of Asia. Our strategy to capture the synergies with our businesses, such as the wealth referral initiatives between Commercial Banking, Retail Banking and Investment Banking is progressing well. We also continue to steadily attract new clients and increase the ranks of our client advisers, as you will see in our KPIs. Nonetheless, we are slowing the pace of some of the investments in this business given the environment. U.S. Personal Banking further solidified its growth trajectory. Card sales, ANR, interest-earning balances and customer acquisition all saw good growth and we continued to increase digital uptake. Retail Services joined Branded Cards in having double-digit revenue growth this quarter. Retail Banking also grew contributing to a 10% overall revenue increase for the business. As you can see in the presentation, our cost of credit reflects the quality of our loan portfolio in both ICG and PBWM. There were effectively no credit losses in ICG, and U.S. consumer NCLs remain well below the pre-COVID levels. Consumer loan growth together with the worsening of our macroeconomic assumptions drove a modest ACL build this quarter. While our expenses are elevated as we continue to invest in our businesses, and in our transformation, we are managing them closely, and we remain on track to meet the full year guidance. As you know, the transformation is a multiyear effort, and we're committed to meeting the expectations of our regulators given the paramount importance of safety and soundness. We continue to be in constructive dialogues with them and are updating our execution plans as appropriate. Stepping back, I'm generally pleased with the advances we're making in the key drivers of the strategy we laid out for you in March, and these are laid out on Page 3. We're seeing good momentum in realizing client synergies and in attracting talent to grow the franchise. In terms of simplification, we continue to make progress on the divestitures of our international consumer businesses and the elimination of their associated stranded costs. We closed the sale of the Philippines during the third quarter and are on track to close Bahrain, Malaysia and Thailand during the fourth quarter. We also announced the wind down of our consumer franchise in the U.K. to focus fully on the wealth franchise there. I would also note, we're ahead of our plan in our Korean consumer wind down. We continue to shrink our operations in and exposure to Russia. To be clear, our intention is to wind down our presence in that country. In August, we announced the wind down of our consumer and local commercial banking businesses. While we have been supporting our multinational clients in Russia, we are now informing them that we will be ending nearly all of the institutional banking services we offer by the end of the first quarter of next year. At that point, our only operations in Russia will be those necessary to fulfill our remaining legal and regulatory obligations. Turning to capital, we returned $1 billion to our shareholders through common dividends during the quarter, while buybacks continue to be on hold. We will keep evaluating that decision on a quarterly basis as, due to increasing regulatory requirements, we build our CET1 ratio to 13% or so by mid next year, and that includes a management buffer of 100 basis points. We ended the quarter at a CET1 ratio of 12.2% as we actively managed our RWA usage throughout our lines of business. Lastly, our tangible book value per share increased to $80.34. So, the bottom line is that while the environment is a challenging one, and we expect it will remain so, we continue to focus relentlessly on executing the strategy we presented to you at our Investor Day and on making steady progress. Now I'd like to turn it over to Mark. And then we'd be delighted, as always, to take your questions.","billion, , revenue, net income, liquidity, loan growth, trillion, cet1",yes,Yes,cet1,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,Yes,cet1 ratio
2022,Q3,Mark Mason,"Thank you, Jane, and good morning, everyone. I'm going to start with the firm-wide financial results, focusing on year-over-year comparisons for the third quarter, unless I indicate otherwise, and spend a little more time on expenses, credit and capital. Then I will turn to the results of each segment and end with full year 2022 guidance. On Slide 4, we show financial results for the full firm. In the third quarter, we reported net income of $3.5 billion and EPS of $1.63, with an RoTCE of 8.2% on $18.5 billion of revenues. Embedded in these results are pretax divestiture-related impacts of approximately $520 million, largely driven by a gain on the sale of the Philippines consumer business. Excluding divestiture-related impacts, EPS and RoTCE would have been $1.50 and 7.5%, respectively. In the quarter, total revenues increased 6% on a reported basis. Excluding divestiture-related impacts, revenues were down 1%, as growth in net interest income was more than offset by lower noninterest revenues. Net interest income grew 18%, driven by the impact of higher interest rates across the firm and strong loan growth in PBWM. Noninterest revenues were down 12% on a reported basis and 28% excluding divestiture-related impacts, largely reflecting declines in investment banking, markets, and investment revenues in wealth. Total expenses of $12.7 billion increased 8% and 7%, excluding divestiture-related impacts, largely driven by transformation, inflation and other risk and control initiatives. Cost of credit was $1.4 billion, driven by net credit losses of approximately $900 million and an ACL build of approximately $500 million, primarily driven by loan growth in PBWM. At the end of the quarter, we had $18.7 billion in total reserves with a reserve to funded loan ratio of approximately 2.5%. On Slide 5, we show net interest income, loans and deposits. In the third quarter, total net interest income increased by approximately $600 million on a sequential basis and approximately $1.9 billion on a year over-year basis across the firm, driven by higher interest rates, management of deposit repricing and loan growth in PBWM. Average loans were down by approximately 2%, largely driven by the impact of foreign exchange translation and lower balances in Legacy Franchises. Excluding FX, loans were largely flat. And average deposits were down by approximately 2%, largely driven by declines in Legacy Franchises and the impact of foreign exchange translation, partially offset by the issuance of institutional CDs as we continue to diversify the funding profile of the bank. Excluding FX, deposits were up roughly 1%. And sequentially, our net interest margin increased by 7 basis points. On Slide 6, we show an expense walk for the third quarter with the key underlying drivers. As I mentioned earlier, expenses increased by 8%, and 7% excluding the impact of divestitures. 2% of the increase was driven by transformation investments with about 2/3 related to the risk, controls, data and finance programs and approximately 25% of the investments in those programs are related to technology. As of today, we have over 10,000 people dedicated to the transformation. About 1% of the expense increase was driven by business-led investments as we continue to hire commercial and investment bankers as well as client advisers in wealth, and we continue to invest in the client experience as well as front-office onboarding and platforms. 1% was due to higher volume-related expenses across both PBWM and ICG, and approximately 3% was driven by other risk and control investments and inflation, partially offset by productivity savings and the impact of foreign exchange translation. Across all these buckets, we continue to invest in technology, including systems and hiring people, resulting in our technology-related spend of approximately 16% for the quarter. On Slide 7, we show key consumer and corporate credit metrics. Over the last several years, we have been disciplined with our loan growth and consistent with our risk appetite framework. This framework includes credit risk limits that consider concentrations including country, industry, credit rating and in the case of consumer, FICO scores. And importantly, these limits apply across the firm in aggregate and we continuously analyze our portfolios and concentrations under a range of stress scenarios. As a result, we feel very good about our asset quality and reserve levels. As I mentioned earlier, our reserves to funded loan ratio was approximately 2.5%. And within that, PBWM and U.S. Cards is 3.7% and 7.5%, respectively, both right around day 1 CECL levels. In PBWM, the majority of our card portfolios skew towards higher FICO customers. And while we have started to see signs of normalization in both portfolios, NCL rates continue to be less than half of pre-COVID levels. In our ICG portfolio, of our total exposure, over 80% is investment grade and nonaccrual loans remain low and are in line with pre-pandemic levels at about 40 basis points of total loans. So we are well reserved for a variety of scenarios and we continuously evaluate our scenarios to reflect the evolving macro environment. On Slide 8, we show our summary balance sheet and key capital and liquidity metrics. We maintained a very strong balance sheet. Of our $2.4 trillion of assets about 23% or $557 billion are high-quality liquid assets, or HQLA, and we maintained total liquidity resources of approximately $967 billion. The combination of earnings generation, capital from exits and RWA optimization drove our CET1 ratio up by about 25 basis points to approximately 12.2% on a standardized basis, which remains our binding constraint. And our tangible book value per share was $80.34, up 2% from a year ago. On Slide 9, we show a sequential CET1 walk to provide more detail on the drivers this quarter and our target over the next few quarters. First, we generated $3.2 billion of net income to common, which added 27 basis points. Second, we returned $1 billion in the form of common dividends, which drove a reduction of about 8 basis points. Third, the interest rate impact on AOCI through our AFS investment portfolio drove a 5 basis point reduction. Fourth, changes in the DTA drove a 3 basis point reduction. And finally, the remaining 14 basis point increase was largely driven by net RWA optimization. On Slide 10, we show the results for our Institutional Clients Group. Revenues were down 5% as strong growth in services was more than offset by lower revenues across markets and banking. Expenses increased 10% driven by transformation, business-led investments and volume-related expenses, partially offset by productivity and foreign exchange translation. Cost of credit was driven by a reserve build of $86 million. While deterioration in certain macro variables did lead to a build, it was mostly offset by the release of a COVID-19 related uncertainty reserve and a release related to direct exposures in Russia. This resulted in net income of approximately $2.2 billion, down 30%. Average loans were up 1%, driven by 9% growth in TTS loans, partially offset by the impact of foreign exchange translation. Average deposits were down 2%, also largely driven by foreign exchange translation. And ICG delivered an RoTCE of 9%. On Slide 11, we show revenue performance by business and the key drivers we laid out at Investor Day, which we will show you each quarter. In services, we continue to see a very strong new client pipeline and deepening with our existing clients and expect that momentum to continue. In Treasury and Trade Solutions, revenues were up 40%, driven by 61% growth in net interest income as well as 8% growth in NIR across all client segments. We continue to see healthy underlying drivers in TTS that indicate consistently strong client activity, with U.S. dollar clearing volumes up 2%, cross-border flows up 10%, commercial card volumes up roughly 50% and average loans up 9%. So while the rate environment drove about 40% of the growth this quarter, business actions drove the remaining 60%. This includes continuing to manage deposit repricing and deepening with existing clients and significant new client wins across all client segments. Through the first half of the year, based on the industry data that we see, we estimate that we gained over 60 basis points of share with large corporate clients. And client wins are up approximately 20% across all segments, including wins with financial institutions, which are up almost 50%. These include marquee transactions where we are serving as the client's primary operating bank. In addition, so far this year, we have onboarded approximately 5,800 suppliers, and we recently launched our innovative suite product in the in the U.S. and Asia which allows clients to connect their liquidity and funding to their operating flows 7 days a week. In Securities Services, revenues grew 15% as net interest income grew 73%, driven by higher interest rates across currencies, partly offset by a 6% decrease in noninterest revenue due to the impact of market valuations. We continue to be pleased with the execution in Securities Services as we onboarded approximately $1 trillion of assets under custody and administration so far this year from significant client wins, and we feel very good about the pipeline of new deals. And we estimate that we have gained about 60 basis points of share in Securities Services through the first half of this year, including in our home market. As a reminder, the services businesses are central to our strategy and are two of our higher returning businesses with strong linkages across the firm. Markets revenues were down 7%, largely driven by spread products, equities and RWA actions as we continue to focus on returns. Fixed Income Markets revenues were up 1% as strength in rates and FX was largely offset by continued headwinds in spread products. And through the first half of the year, we gained approximately 40 basis points of share. Equity markets revenues were down 25%, primarily reflecting reduced client activity in equity derivatives relative to a very strong quarter last year. The actions we took to optimize RWA in markets are in line with the strategy we discussed at Investor Day, and we are making solid progress on our revenue to RWA targets so far this year. And finally, banking revenues, excluding gains and losses on loan hedges, were down 49%, driven by investment banking, as heightened macro uncertainty and volatility continue to impact client activity. Also embedded in the results is an impact of approximately $110 million related to marks on loan commitments and losses on loan sales. So overall, while the market environment remains challenging, we feel good about the progress we are making as we continue to deepen existing client relationships as well as acquire new clients. Now turning to Slide 12. We show the results for our Personal Banking & Wealth Management business. Revenues were up 6% as net interest income grow was partially offset by a decline in noninterest revenue, driven by lower investment fee revenue in wealth and higher partner payments in Retail Services. Expenses were up 13%, driven by transformation, other risk and control initiatives business-led investments and volume-driven expenses, partially offset by productivity savings. Cost of credit was $1.1 billion which included a reserve build primarily driven by card volume growth. NCLs were 13% higher year-over-year from near historically low levels, reflecting normalization, particularly in Retail Services. Overall, we continue to see strong credit performance across portfolios. Average loans grew 5%, driven by strong growth across Branded Cards, Retail Services and Retail Banking. Average deposits grew 1%, driven by growth across retail and wealth, partially offset by foreign exchange translation. PBWM delivered an RoTCE of 9.7%. On Slide 13, we show PBWM revenues by product as well as key business drivers and metrics. Branded Cards revenues were up 10%, driven by higher net interest income. We continue to see strong underlying drivers with new account acquisitions up 10%, card spend volumes up 14% and average loans up 12%. Retail Services revenues were up 12%, also driven by higher net interest income, partially offset by higher partner payments. So despite payment rates remaining elevated, the investments we've been making contributed to growth in interest-earning balances of 9% in Branded Cards and 7% in Retail Services, and we expect to continue to grow these balances in the fourth quarter. Retail Banking revenues were up 2%, primarily driven by interest rates and deposit growth. Wealth revenues were down 2%, as investment fee headwinds, particularly in Asia, more than offset net interest income growth. Excluding Asia, revenues were up 4%. Client advisers were up 5%, and we are seeing net new investment inflows and strong new client acquisitions across our wealth business with new clients in ultra-high net worth and Wealth at Work up 7% and 27%, respectively, for the quarter. And we are also leveraging our retail network, which has driven almost 50,000 wealth referrals so far this year. While the environment continues to remain challenging, we are seeing strong underlying business drivers as we execute against our strategy. On Slide 14, we show results for Legacy Franchises. Revenues increased 66%, primarily driven by the Philippines gain on sale in the quarter and the absence of the Australia loss on sale in the prior year period. Excluding these items, revenues were down about 12% largely due to the loss of revenues from the Australia and Philippines closing as well as the impact of the Korea wind down. Expenses increased 6%, driven by divestiture impacts in Asia and Mexico. Loans and deposits decreased as a result of the reclassification of signed exits to other assets and other liabilities, the closing of the Philippine sale and the impact of the Korea wind down. On Slide 15, we show results for Corporate / Other. Revenues increased, largely driven by higher net revenue from the investment portfolio, partially offset by the mark-to-market on certain derivative transactions and expenses were down. On Slide 16, I'll briefly touch on our full year 2022 outlook. With one quarter remaining in the year, we continue to expect full year revenues to be up in the low single-digit range, excluding divestiture-related impacts. And within that, we continue to see a shift with higher net interest income, offset by lower noninterest revenue. So for the fourth quarter, we expect net interest income, excluding markets to be up in the range of $1.5 billion to $1.8 billion year-over-year. Clearly, where we land within that range will be a function of a number of factors, including rates, loans and deposit volumes, deposit betas and currency impacts. Regarding full year expenses, we continue to expect expenses to grow by 7% to 8%, excluding divestiture related impacts. In terms of cost of credit, it will be a function of the evolution of the macro environment, normalization that we continue to expect in the cards businesses and loan growth. And keep in mind that loan growth tends to be higher in the fourth quarter versus the third given typical holiday spending. Before we move to Q&A, I'd like to end with a few key points. We continue to execute on the strategy that we laid out at Investor Day. We are seeing solid momentum in the underlying drivers of the majority of our businesses. And as we said at Investor Day, the financial path will not be linear, but we are confident we can achieve our medium-term targets in a variety of scenarios. And with that, Jane and I would be happy to take your questions.","billion, , revenue, cet1, net income, liquidity, million, loan growth, trillion, net interest income",yes,Yes,cet1,No,,Yes,reserve build,No,,No,,No,,No,,Yes,"cet1 ratio, net interest margin"
2022,Q3,"Question And Answer
Operator",Our first question will come from Glenn Schorr with Evercore.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Glenn Schorr,"So definitely a good performance out of TTS, rates helped a ton, but I see loan growth and fees, and I heard your comments about growth across all client segments. I wonder if we could pull back the onion a drop and talk about those two in separate pieces. One is 61% year-on-year NII, how do betas factor in and go forward over the next year in terms of higher rates and how that factors through? And then two, what specifically is growing within TTS across those client segments to drive that high single digit growth?",loan growth,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Mark Mason,"Glenn, why don't I take that and kind of take it in the 2 pieces that you laid out. So as you know, Glenn, when we think about our business just in aggregate, there's obviously a split between the institutional and the consumer side. Our TTS business, which is on the Institutional side, and these corporate clients, they tend to have higher betas in general than obviously, the Retail Banking side. What we've seen is that the betas have been increasing. They are still running lower than what we had expected. But again, they have been increasing. And with continued expected rate increases, I would expect that those betas will continue to rise in the coming quarters. We have been actively managing deposit pricing and repricing with our clients on an ongoing basis. You know that this is more than just a deposit-taking business. This is a business where we are looking to manage the operating accounts of our clients and bring the breadth of what we offer in our franchise to them. And so that's the type of conversation we've been having with them, and we'll continue to do that with an eye towards growing the volume of deposits with both the existing as well as with new clients. And so we, again, expect to see betas rise but also expect to see continued contribution to the NII. The other aspect of your question is what else has been driving the activity. I mentioned a couple of those things. So it's not just deepening with existing clients, but it's also onboarding new clients. We've seen cross-border transaction value up about 10%. The commercial card spend is up meaningfully. Trade originations are up 27%. And so a lot of active engagement with our clients. We've been winning new mandates. We've seen an uptick in client wins, up about 20%, and we've been gaining share across those client segments. And so hopefully, that gives you a little bit of examples of where the benefits or momentum is coming from on the NIR side. The NIR growth of 8% is driven really by the cards, the payments and receivables as well as trade.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Jane Fraser,"And I'd just jump in and say, I think there's a bit of a miss at the moment that the global environment is detrimental to activity. We see quite the opposite. Volatility is something in which we're very active in helping our multinational clients around the world manage the local footprint we have and the global network we have is a tremendous asset right now, so we're seeing a lot of positive momentum, which may not always be intuitive to everyone, but I think it's what makes the network, the crown jewel of Citi.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Glenn Schorr,"No doubt. I appreciate all that. A quick one on Markets. Not quite as good as peers, but that comes and goes, I know that's a function of last year was really strong. It's a function of mix in any given quarter. What I really want to focus on is your comments on RWA optimization, what specifically are you doing? I know it's the banking book, but I did see you taking down your capital, call it redemption facility line. But in markets, what are you pulling back on RWA, just which pieces of that business? I’d find that interesting.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Mark Mason,"Sure. So Glenn, you'll remember at Investor Day, we talked not only about RWA optimization broadly, but specifically as it relates to Markets. And we talked about the idea of increasing our revenue to RWA ratio for markets to about 5.5% over the course of that Investor Day period. So we've been actively working across the Markets business in equities, in fixed income and spread products and looking for opportunities where there are low returning uses of RWA to either increase the returns on that or to actually kind of exit it. And that includes a host of different structures. It includes working with clients to post additional collateral in some instances and other types of structures like that, that improved the RWA, including hedging and like I said, posting collateral and taking a look at margin that we have and ensuring that we are, in fact, getting the most for that use of RWA.",revenue,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Operator,Our next question will come from John McDonald with Autonomous Research. JOHN Mc,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Donald,"Mark, I wanted to just clarify what I think the expense guide is for fourth quarter. It seems like the guidance for the full year implies a fourth quarter step-up to maybe $12.8B and change from $12.75B this quarter. Is that the right read, a little bit of a step-up in the fourth quarter? And is that just a pull-through of investments? And what would be driving that?",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Mark Mason,"So again, the guidance on full year expenses hasn't changed. It's the 7% to 8% ex the impact of divestitures that would imply a bit of an uptick there. It is on the heels of the continued investments that we're making and that's flowing through as well as how revenues kind of play out and the associated compensation activity that goes along with that. So nothing extraordinary and consistent with the guidance given. JOHN Mc",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Donald,"Okay. And I know it's too early to give formal guidance for next year. But if we look at the Investor Day slides, it seems to imply that expenses go up for a few years until you get to the medium term. Is that the right read? And when I annualize where you'll be exiting the fourth quarter here, implies that at $51 billion or so next year as a starting point. I mean is it fair when I read the Investor Day slides and think about your investments that directionally expenses probably do go up next year?",billion,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Mark Mason,"John, I'd say, as you know, right, we'll give guidance for 2023 next quarter. But I think if you think back to the Investor Day and you think about some of the things that, that we just commented on with regard to our services business, we'd expect to see continued tailwinds as it relates to net interest income. We would expect to get to the heart of your question that we will continue to invest in the franchise in the transformation, that would obviously peak and then we would start to see the benefits start to play out from that in that medium-term period. And so yes, you can probably expect some type of a tick up, but I'll give you more details on that when we talk about the '23 outlook in the next quarter.",net interest income,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Operator,Our next question will come from Erika Najarian with UBS.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Erika Najarian,"I just wanted to take a step back. Your 11% to 12% medium-term RoTCE target had contemplated an 11.5% to 12% CET1 versus the 13% that you're targeting to by midyear next year, also that you laid out on that same slide that you're targeting 2% Fed funds over the medium term, which seems kind of cute right now. So I guess I'm wondering, your confidence and you said you're confident you could hit medium-term targets even with this creep in capital. Is it really that shift in the rate environment that's helping you get there despite the higher denominator?",cet1,no,Yes,cet1,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Mark Mason,"So thank you for the question. Look, I think there are a couple of things to kind of think back on that still hold true, which is the strategy that we've built, I think, is a resilient strategy and it really spoke to top line momentum that we expected not just through rate increases, but also through share gains and also through the business-led investments that we're making and better leveraging the synergies and linkages across the franchise. All of those things still hold true to the top line. You're right, the Fed funds assumption has changed. Back in March, I think we all were looking at a Fed funds rate at the end of the year that was closer to 1.5% or so. And so now here we are with the hikes that we've seen and looking at something certainly north of 4% or 4.5%. And so that's changed meaningfully. But there are a number of other drivers that contribute to achieving that return. It's the medium term, so call it 3 to 5 years, I think, is how we characterized it and starting to see some of the benefits from the transformation investments that we're making. To your point on capital, we are building to the 13%. Remember, that is a by-product of a 4% SCB for this particular CCAR cycle and the strategy that we described includes a mix in our shift of revenues and earnings over time, a mix towards more stable PPNR and more fee revenues that will contribute to, I think, a balance sheet and a mix that generates fewer losses, stress losses, than our balance sheet might today. So the contribution of those things, we think, will drive that return target that we've set, and we still remain confident about that. Now with that said, there are unknowns that are out there. I just spoke to many of the knowns. And so what happens with further capital requirements and the current regulatory regime and what have you, it's hard to predict. But we'll manage to that as we learn and know more about it.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,Yes,ccar,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Erika Najarian,"Got it. And my follow-up question is given Citi's valuation on book, I think your current and prospective shareholders are waiting for buybacks to potentially return. I guess a two-part question here. Number one, especially if you think you think you could stabilize your PPNR in the stress test, why 100 basis point management buffer versus one of your peers at 50 that reported today? And secondarily, as we think about the return of buybacks, I imagine that once you hit that 13%, the buybacks could return. But how does the Banamex sale potentially impact the timing, as I recall, there's a currency translation adjustment that could be negative upfront at announcement to CET1, but you get that all back during close. So I guess the real big question here is how should we think about, what are the mile markers for the return of buyback activity at Citi?",cet1,no,Yes,cet1,No,,No,,Yes,stress test,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Mark Mason,"Thank you, Erika. There's a lot there to unpack, so if I forget anything, just please remind me. But I'll start at the beginning, which is I know where we trade in terms of book value. And I'd love to be in a position where we were buying back given that valuation. With that said, we're going to take it quarter by quarter, as I think you've heard us say and evaluate what buyback decisions and capital actions make the most sense in light of the environment that we're managing through, we're clearly managing through an uncertain environment. As I just said and as you kind of mentioned as well, we do see our business mix shifting over time on the heels of our strategy. I do think that over time, that will contribute, as I said, to the capital requirements that we have, but that's over the medium term. And we do still see a fair amount of volatility in the stress capital buffer. And part of the reason that we have the management buffer is to deal not only with that uncertainty in the SCB, but also in interest rates. And we're seeing volatility in both, frankly. And so we'll continue to evaluate the management buffer as well to see what makes sense as we move towards that medium term. In terms of the Mexico transaction, you're right in terms of we have mentioned before, the CTA component to that. That is a timing difference. We have factored that in to the path to our 13% by middle of next year and factor that into achieving the longer term targets that we set for ourselves.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Operator,Our next question will come from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Mike Mayo,"Look, I look at the global network as a curse and a blessing. I guess the curse part is simply the complexity and the expenses. And Mark, you said expenses should go up higher next year. You're not going to tell us for a few more months, but I'm just wondering when you think you can grow revenues faster than expenses. Again it's not new news, the revenues and expenses. You guided it and you're within that range. It’s just do we have to wait a year or 3 years or how long for that complexity to get more simplified so revenues can catch up to that expense growth? And then on the blessing side, Mark, you mentioned, you said gain share in those clients segments, I thought that was little vague. I mean you talked about trade, you talked about other activities connecting multinational corporations in the spirit of volatility, so if you could a little more meat on the bone as far when you talk about market share and those tailwinds on the revenues while you have the headwinds on the expenses from the global network.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Jane Fraser,"Hey, Mike, it's Jane, jumping in because I do want to talk a bit about your point on the global network here. I have to tell you, I'm hard pressed to find a negative to the global network. We start off with the vision for the bank that we laid out in March. It is to be the preeminent banking partner for clients with cross border needs. Who are those clients? It is 5,000 multinationals and their subsidiaries, it's institutional investors and the ultra-high net worth clients with a heavy tilt to family offices. And we serve them on FX, on liquidity management, on their payroll, on their supply chain as well as strategic advice, financing, et cetera. That's $4 trillion in daily volume, 80% of that credit portfolio is investment grade. So when we're looking at it, it's the multinationals. To take a higher risk country, the client base we're serving there are the global multinationals much more than the local players. And so this is a relatively simple, high returning, very well growing as we're seeing at the moment, capability that is exceedingly hard to replicate. So let me pass over to Mark in terms of what are some of the examples of different areas of the drivers of growth? This is, as I said at the beginning, this is a crown jewel. It's not a source of complexity for the bank.","trillion, liquidity",yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Mark Mason,"So Mike, I'd say a couple of things. One, what I said was that we continue to gain share, and I referenced specifically about 60 basis points of share with large corporate clients. And we're also winning mandates and gaining share with other client segments as well. You know that the Commercial Banking client segment is one that we are focused on, given the strength of our platform and its applicability to those sized clients as well. I mentioned that our wins are up and specifically, they're up 20%, the mandates that we're winning across all client segments. And that specifically with FIs, they're up almost 50%. So hopefully, that gives you some sense of where the revenue growth is coming from. The takeaway there is it's both existing as well as new clients as we kind of continue to build out the platform and build out our capabilities to reach them. So the second part of your question was around expenses and expenses growing and when will we have top line growth that exceeds the expense growth. And I'd remind you that the work we're doing on the transformation as well as the business-led investments are multiyear almost by definition and important in order to derive savings in our structural cost base over time. And at Investor Day, I think I pointed to by the time we got to that medium-term period, we would see our operating efficiency go down to less than 60%. I think we've been very deliberate about trying to give you guidance and update you on guidance for the full year and along the way and we'll be consistent in that discipline. And I can certainly give you more color on '23, as I mentioned earlier to John, in the next quarter.",revenue,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Mike Mayo,"I guess one clarification. When you say you've gained 60 basis points of share with large corporate clients, what do you mean by share, share of what?",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Mark Mason,"Yes, of wallet, 60 basis points, not 50, 60. So market share with them.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Operator,Our next question will come from Ebrahim Poonawala with Bank of America.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Ebrahim Poonawala,"I guess one, just, Mark, I wanted to clarify your NII guide for $1.5B to $1.8B, is just total NII, right? It's not ex Markets or anything?",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Mark Mason,It is ex Markets.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Ebrahim Poonawala,"It is ex Markets. Any perspective or view on where you see Markets heading in fourth quarter, just given what's happened with the rate backdrop?",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Mark Mason,"I very intentionally don't forecast Markets NII in a rising rate environment, you would normally see the markets NII come down. It tends to be liability sensitive. But we tend to focus on, as you probably heard me say a number of times, total revenues for this business. And I guess what I'd highlight is that in periods of uncertainty and lots of market volatility, our businesses tend to perform well. And so we'll see how the fourth quarter plays out. There's obviously some seasonality to it that has taken place historically. And so we have to kind of factor all those things in, but we'll have to see how it further evolves.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Operator,Our next question will come from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Betsy Graseck,"Just two things. One, just another question on the expense side. I just wanted to follow up with regard to, Mark, the stranded costs that you had talked about at the Barclays conference. And I'm wondering if I got the message right there, which is when you exit the consumer businesses, there's 25% that is generally managed through a TSA, so it's a service agreement and that expense will come off over time. And then there's another 25%, which is likely not to come off. Is that fair? Or is there a different message that I'm missing on that?",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Mark Mason,"Yeah, that's not fair. But I appreciate the add more clarity. So I bucket into 3 buckets. So one is when we do these transactions, both Jane and I have deep experience in this. We tend to see about half of the costs go away to the buyer, so when we do the transaction, when we do the sale. As you pointed out, about 25% is often in place as part of a transition service agreement. And so there's revenues that we get paid to offset that expense until things have totally transitioned and then that goes away. And then the third bucket is what I call potentially stranded cost and what Jane calls not stranded cost, right? And I say potentially because they are regional expenses that get allocated to countries, for example, they're global expenses that get allocated to the region and to the countries, for example, and what we have to do and what we're doing is we're attacking what would otherwise be stranded cost. And we're attacking that by telling each of the functions in the business, and here's your portion of that 25% and come back and tell me how you're going to rethink your org structure, simplify your processes in order to drive that cost out of the company, right? And so that's what we've been doing. Remember, the expense base here is probably $7 billion. So you can break down kind of the population that we're talking about. We've already stood up a team to work with each of the businesses and each of the functions around getting in front of that cost, so that we can drive that down over the near-term period of time.",billion,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Jane Fraser,"And as a Scotswoman, I just can't help myself but jump in here. I think as Mark and I are both pretty maniacally focused around this. But I'd say at the moment, we've had a couple of the divestitures close. We have another 3 next quarter, and this continues on. We already started on Australia and the Philippines and getting those expenses down, as Mark said. There is going to be, and we will not be shy in capturing as an opportunity to simplify our organization further next year when we have more of the divestitures close and streamlining more of our regional management structures, more of the expenses at the global level. So there is more to come on that, and we'll be looking to do that as I indicated at Investor Day that will be an important part once more of the divestitures are closed, starting in '23, going into '24.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Betsy Graseck,"Right. So you were, Mark's potentially stranded costs, and Jane, you are no stranded cost. The no stranded cost is in the guide medium term?",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Mark Mason,In terms of the time to get it out – yes.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Jane Fraser,"Yes. And I think as Mark talks about expenses, you've got to look at the various different dynamics that are going on. So yes, we've got investments into the transformation at the moment. Many of those translate into better efficiency as well as a safer, stronger firm the divestitures translate into lower cost, but also we eliminate the stranded costs, and we simplify the organization. You've got a number of different factors that we will make completely transparent to you at play in our expense base from a more structural dimension in the quarters ahead.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Operator,Our next question will come from Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. MATT O’,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Connor,"Can you guys talk about the pace of addressing some of the regulatory issues out there? On the one hand, you got out of the AML consent order earlier this year, which I think was a very big positive. But on the other hand, there was an article last month, suggesting regulators want you to go faster. And I think we all know regulators always want things to go faster on these issues, but I did want to ask the question.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Jane Fraser,"Yes. We all want things to go faster, both our clients, our shareholders, the management team, regulators, the Board, all. So I think we're fully aligned there. Maybe if I take a step back on this one. Transformation is our #1 priority. It will be a multiyear journey and prioritizing safety and soundness is a very important global bank is a nonnegotiable for all of us. Where are we? I think we were delighted to see the AML consent order get closed with the OCC. We continue to work on the regulatory orders we have. I have to say we have constant and constructive engagement with our regulators that personally, I find them to be very helpful and essential to our success. We have got a lot to get done. As you can see from the hiring numbers, we've been investing heavily in the talent and the resources that we need. As we've also said, this is not only going to benefit our safety and soundness, but also in terms of our client, excellence in delivery and ultimately, for our shareholders as well. I think the foundation that we need for this is largely in place. And so Mark and I and frankly, the whole management team, we're very focused on continuing to execute on the various plans we submitted and the overall transformation of Citi from a strategic and another dimension. We obviously can't give more details than that because this is confidential supervisory information, but I hope that gives you a good feel. MATT O’",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,Yes,occ,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Connor,"And I guess when you say the foundation is largely in place, like what are some of the things that are missing? Or is it just a matter of, say, executing on the divestitures?",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Jane Fraser,"It's timing. So some of the areas, for example, where we're making technology investments, those ones where we've had fragmented technology platforms, we're migrating them into a single platform or into an industry standard where we've not been on one that we want for the future. Those things take some time to put in place. But you can see from the investments we've made, both headcount and the shift from consulting to much more of our own people. You'll see the technology increase in that shift as well. So some of that is just a natural progression you'd expect over time.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Operator,Our next question will come from Jim Mitchell with Seaport Global.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Jim Mitchell,"Maybe just on deposits and behavior. You guys clearly have a different mix by geography and by business. Deposits ex currency were up 1%. Your peers were down close to 3%. So how do we think about deposit behavior going forward given your mix of geography and business? Is it just the overseas rate hikes have been behind the curve versus the U.S., but we'll start to see more deposit outflows over there? Or do you think your deposits can hold up a little better.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Mark Mason,"Yes, it's a great question, and so why don't I take that, so a couple of things, and you started to allude to it. The first is that when you think about our business, you've got about between ICG and our PBWM business of 65%, 35% split in terms of the deposits. You also have a U.S. dollar denominated versus non-U.S. dollar-denominated split that is pretty meaningful as well. And then to your point, we've got different currencies and different rate hikes by different central banks around the world. And that then is juxtaposed against different beta behavior from customers. And so on the ICG side, we tend to see higher betas. And obviously, with rates increasing at a more rapid pace, we expect those to get closer to our expectations in the near term. We're starting to see many more hikes around the globe or outside of the U.S. And so again, we expect to see betas which operate at a much lower pace level outside of the U.S. but start to tick up. And so over time, I think we will see continued tailwinds from an NII as the differences between U.S. and non U.S. activity play out. And so that has played to our benefit, I think, and should continue to play to our benefit. If you think about what I've talked about before in terms of our IRE, our interest rate exposure, and the cash flow approach that we are moving towards taking, in some ways it captures exactly that point. And so if you see a 100 basis point move in the curve cross currencies, we're looking at as much as a $2.2 billion increase. And when you look at that increase, it skews more heavily towards the non-U.S. dollar than the U.S. dollar. And that is in part because of the different moves in rate curves by currency as well as the different betas by client type in U.S. versus non-U.S.","billion, cash flow",yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Jim Mitchell,"Okay. That's really helpful. And then maybe just a second question just on the impact in the fourth quarter. You’re closing on 3 divestitures, how do we think about the P&L and capital impact of that in the fourth quarter?",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Mark Mason,"I think I talked about the idea of the divestitures contributing close to $3 billion for the full year, $3.1 or so billion in terms of the capital impact for the full year 2022. The combination of Australia and the Philippines gets us to about $2.1 billion or so. And so the balance of the divestitures that we've scoped out for the fourth quarter should close that gap, Thailand, Malaysia, Bahrain, the signing of China, et cetera, should close that gap to getting us to that $3.1 billion. With most of that is skewing towards the first 3, Thailand, Malaysia, Bahrain.","billion, ",yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Operator,Our next question will come from Gerard Cassidy with RBC.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Gerard Cassidy,"Jane, you talked about your global footprint and the strength that gives you as an organization. And so maybe this question is very appropriate for Citigroup, which is the following. You guys have a real good window into the global financial markets. And there's been some disruption out there, we all know about what's going on in the U.K. pension funds. You had the Swiss National Bank come into the New York Fed this week for $6.3 billion of currency swaps. We know there's a large broker having challenges over there.So can you guys give us a flavor, what are you seeing from a stress standpoint. What are the liquidity metrics that you're watching to see if some other stresses pop up how the global financial markets will handle that?","billion, liquidity",no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Jane Fraser,"Yes. It's a very good question. It's one we spend a lot of time on. And I think as Mark alluded, we're constantly doing different stress tests on the market, on clients on different areas. And as I said in the opening remarks, we're more focused on the liquidity in the market at the moment and the impact on some counterparties much more than we are on our credit risk, that could change over time, depending particularly what happens from a tail risk on the geopolitics here. What are we seeing going on? I think a lot of the focus is in Europe. Right now, which is sort of at the center of the storm. We're seeing some areas where there could be energy supply constraints impacting some clients. So we're watching industrial production moved to the U.S., for example, which are the places where the cost of production is lower, a potential buffer for some of the slowdown in U.S. manufacturing and the like because the demand for goods softened, for example. We're seeing areas where clients on the collateral front, where there's a situation of intense volatility that hits or a surprise drop as we saw in gilts is having an impact on liquidity and therefore, margining, which is what happens and has been happening with the U.K. pension funds with the derivatives. So a lot of the areas we look at is what's the collateral behind different institutions as we have done with the commodity players earlier on in the year, we've been looking at some of the LDIs at the moment. And as we see different stresses, we're jumping on it. I think the central banks are also ready to jump in as needed and certainly attuned to the importance of agility in these situations as well. As our large global institutions like ourselves as to how do we help support the market, the benefit for our bank is because we're in a strong position on all of our capital, on liquidity, on balance sheet and the credit portfolio, as you can see, is extraordinary at the moment, zero losses in ICG this quarter. Again, we're in a position to be able to jump in and play an important role. But it's a bit of whack-a-mole, I would say.",liquidity,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Gerard Cassidy,"Very good. And then, Mark, just as a follow-up. You touched on your investment banking numbers and your markets numbers. And yes, investment banking for everybody has been a struggle, obviously, this year. Your advisory numbers actually were better than your peers on a year-over year basis in terms of growth, but DCM was quite a bit weaker. Can you kind of give us a little more color there? And also, how do the pipelines look going into the fourth quarter?",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Mark Mason,"Yes, sure. So look, as we've all seen, the wallets have been under meaningful pressure year-over-year down more than 50%. We did show some strong performance in parts of the business. We've been hiring, frankly, as Jane has mentioned before and filling in gaps that we have across the portfolio in health care, tech, energy, et cetera, and feel good about that and are seeing benefits from having made those hires. DCM is really more of a function of low deal volume pretty much across the board. And there really isn't a whole lot more to it than that. But as you know, investment banking is part of the strategy that we discussed at Investor Day and a key part at that and we'll continue to invest in it and ensure we're getting the productivity out of it that the investment warrants, but really not a whole lot more in DCM beyond the low deal volume across the board.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Operator,Our next question will come from Vivek Juneja with JPMorgan.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Vivek Juneja,"Couple of questions for you. Firstly, Mark, I just want to clarify, you said NII ex Markets to be up $1.5 to $1.8 billion year- on-year in the fourth quarter. You were up $1.9 billion year-on-year in the third quarter. Given that there have been more rate hikes during the quarter and even later in the quarter, any color on what's driving that slightly lower NII accretion rather than actually being up at a faster pace?",", billion",no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Mark Mason,"Yes. Again, the important factors here include volume, what we see in both the loan volume, the deposit volume and obviously, betas and how betas play out, and we talked about the idea that with the higher frequency and level of rate increases, that's going to put pressure on the beta in terms of seeing it increase across the board. And then the third factor is rates and what happens with the rates and the timing for which that happens, right? When that happens, matters in the quarter in terms of whether you see that benefit in it or in subsequent quarters. And so those are the factors that drive that range that I've given you. And it's across both the PBWM portfolio as well as how it plays out in TTS. And given the world we're managing through, quantitative tightening and the like, and I think the other factor is obviously FX and how that plays out. So those are the main drivers, Vivek, and the range reflects any variety of ways that they could play out in the quarter.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Vivek Juneja,"Okay. Completely different question for both of you. Securities Services, you talked about $1 trillion in new business wins seems to be doing really well. Any color, if you can remind us on which client segments you're seeing this in? And I remember you're saying on the call that it's domestic also, but any more color into where you're growing and where you're seeing all this?",trillion,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Jane Fraser,"We're seeing this in a number of different areas, the one that is most material was the win we had with BlackRock in a particularly sizable percentage of business there here in the States and in a particularly important and attractive part of the Securities Services business as well. But we have been winning some sizable business across the board. And a part of this, I think, comes from the fact that we're able to link the pre and post trade together to drive a lot of efficiencies for our clients and bring some insights that some of the other players are not able to do in helping them manage and get competitive advantage in their businesses. So we're an attractive one from that. Mark, anything else to add?",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Mark Mason,"I mean we're very pleased with the growth here and the win mandates that we've been seeing across the board, but particularly in the U.S., as Jane highlights. And some of it is a rate benefit, but a good portion of it is again, those new mandates, those new additional assets that we're bringing in. The final point that I'd make on it is that, and I'd reiterate it, I guess, is that this is not only one of our businesses that's growing quite rapidly, but it's also a high returning business for us as well. And so consistent with the strategy that we talked about at Investor Day and one that reflects linkages across the franchise, and so we feel very good about that.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Operator,Our next question will come from Ken Usdin with Jefferies.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Ken Usdin,"Just two quick ones. Mark, you talked about the capital impact of the legacy exits. Is there a way you can dimension how much in the fourth quarter from revenues and NII perspective comes out from the legacy?",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Mark Mason,"I do not have that in front of me, Ken. I've got a page in here, page 22 reflects some of the size of the exit markets, but I do not have that in front of me. I'd have to circle back with you, Ken.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Ken Usdin,"Okay. I would assume that's been a part of the prior question about NII trajectory, right? There's a negative impact embedded in that in the fourth quarter as well, right? That's just part of the movement forward.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Mark Mason,"Yes, that is reflected in the NII guidance, but the major drivers are largely what I referenced. But yes, it would be reflected in it.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Operator,Our next question will come from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Mike Mayo,"As a follow-up, why is Citi still banking in Russia when seemingly every other major American company or most of them are out of Russia?",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Jane Fraser,"Mike, as I mentioned in my earlier remarks, we are now informing our multinational clients who are operating in Russia, so these are the U.S., European and Asian core multinationals or the franchise that we are ending nearly all of the institutional banking services. We offer them by the end of the first quarter of 2023, the cost of which I would add is not material. And so at that point, our only operations in Russia will be those necessary to fulfill our remaining legal and regulatory operations there. It's been very important for those multinationals that we've helped support them as they look at exiting the country and their payroll and other elements as they do so, so they've been able to wind down or exit and a few of those who have remained. But we will be, as I said at the very beginning, our intention here is to wind down our operation in the country.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,

2023,Q3,Jane Fraser,"Thank you, Jenn, and good morning to everyone. I shall touch briefly on the macro environment before reviewing the quarter and last month's organization announcement. The global macro backdrop remains a story of de-synchronization. In the U.S., recent data implies a soft landing, but history would suggest otherwise. And we are seeing cracks in the lower FICO consumers. In the Euro-area and the UK, the picture has turned distinctly more negative. The summer weakness in industrial economies is spreading south. And the weight of structurally higher labor and energy costs suggest a more enduring competitiveness challenge for that region. efforts, but it still has to work through weak sentiment, youth unemployment and the pain in its property market. All of these macro dynamics have clearly impacted client sentiment. Septemberis always a busy month seeing clients, and I am struck how consistently CEOs are less optimistic about 2024 than a few months ago. The shift in the rates question from how high to how long has catalyzed more client activity, however. Corporates have stopped waiting for rates to come down and are beginning to access the debt capital markets around the globe. Our multinational clients are adapting their operations to the evolving geopolitical landscape and building redundancy and resiliency. This plays to our strengths and strategy, in particular our invaluable global network. And between our high-quality asset portfolio, strong reserve levels, ample liquidity and diversified earnings base, we are proving to our clients that we truly are a bank for all seasons. Turning to the quarter, today we reported net income of $3.5 billion, an EPS of $1.63 and an ROTCE of 7.7%. Our revenues were up 10% ex-divestitures and each of our five core, interconnected businesses posted revenue growth. We remain on track to meet the revenue and expense guidance we set for the year. revenue quarter in over a decade and it continues to outpace the target we set at Investor Day. Half of that growth was business drivers and the other half rates. Even with impact of the long-expected Argentine devaluation, we again drove fee growth, which is the best sign of the potential of our globally leading franchise. We keep relentlessly innovating for our clients. Amongst other launches, this quarter we announced the creation of Citi Token Services, which will use distributed ledger and smart contract technologies to deliver a digital asset solution for our TTS clients. This is a first for the industry as it allows us to seamlessly integrate a permissioned tokenized bank deposit network with traditional cash services such as 24/7 dollar clearing. Securities Services had revenue growth of 16%, with some good underlying fee growth. We took share again and we have grown our AUC/AUA by over $2 trillion in the last year. This business has considerable momentum and a strong pipeline of clients who are benefitting from the cloud and data investments we are making. Markets was up 10% year-over-year on the back of Rates & Currencies having the best third quarter in 10 years and Commodities grew nicely. This was partially offset by Equities which was down slightly. Despite this we continue to see good momentum in cash and we have grown prime balances year to date. Banking had a good quarter with revenues up 17%, with activity playing to our mix. While corporate lending was essentially flat, as we remain very disciplined about how we use our balance sheet, DCM was healthier and the IPO market also showed some signs of life. This helped drive Investment Banking revenue up 34%, albeit off of a low base and a small wallet. Sitting here today, it remains hard to predict when deal activity will sustainably rebound. Still, I am proud of our role advising on some of the biggest deals globally so far this year. As you know, we are committed to growing our Banking franchise. We have brought together the management of the Investment, Corporate, and Commercial Bank under one umbrella and this structure will help us better drive the important synergies between them. We have been bringing in new talent in key sectors and we have begun to provide more leveraged finance for key clients in the right situations. U.S. Personal Banking was also up double-digits, at 13%. Cards revenues were strong in both our Branded and Retail Services portfolios. The growth in spending is decelerating and the consumer is more mindful what they spend on. Indeed the affluent, who still have excess savings at their disposal, drove the growth in spending, with a continued tilt to travel and entertainment. During the quarter Banking clients. We believe that by tiering offerings and simplifying our fee structure, we will incentivize our clients to deepen their relationships with us. The early reaction from clients along those lines has been very positive. Wealth revenues have stabilized and were up slightly. Most notably Investment revenues picked up across our geographies. The drivers for the franchise - such as referrals, client acquisition, and net new inflows - were all quite strong around the world. And we won important new mandates for Wealth at Work, an offering we had highlighted at Investor Day. Andy Sieg has now officially joined our firm. This is a time of massive global wealth creation- and our the world. In terms of our balance sheet, our discipline of growing operating deposits has enabled us to maintain a stable deposit base over the past five years. We grew loans during the quarter and our credit quality remains extremely strong, aided by our disciplined client selection. Our CET1 ratio grew to 13.5% which is $14 billion above our regulatory minimum and still includes a 100bps internal management buffer. During the quarter, we returned $1.5 billion to our shareholders through common dividends and stock buybacks. We continue to evaluate buybacks quarter-by-quarter and I expect we will continue to do a modest level in the fourth quarter, subject to approval by our Board. And while the ultimate impact of potentially higher through mitigating actions. As you can see on slide 3, we are relentless in executing our strategy. This quarter we closed on the sale of our Taiwan consumer business, the second largest of the Asia consumer divestitures. And earlier this week, we announced that we will sell our consumer wealth portfolio in China to HSBC. This includes approximately $2.6 billion of assets under management and $1 billion of deposits. In the fourth quarter, we expect to close on the sale of our Indonesia consumer business. In terms of the international consumer businesses we are exiting, in addition to the three wind-down markets, we have restarted the sales process in Poland, and we remain on track to separate Mexico next year, followed by an IPO in 2025. Transformation remains our number one priority. We are deep into the large body of work of automating manual controls and processes, consolidating fragmented tech platforms, and upgrading our data architecture. We are committed to doing this the right way, knowing that it will take time to meet our regulators expectations and to deliver a modern, more efficient infrastructure. Last month we announced consequential changes that align our organizational structure with our strategy and changes how we run the bank. I said at Investor Day that organizational simplification would follow the divestitures. The changes will eliminate layers, duplication, and complexity allowing us to operate the bank more agilely and freeing our people up to focus on clients and execution. Elevating the five core businesses to my leadership team will enable me to drive greater accountability and sustainable results. To bring it alive, the actions we have taken in the last four weeks will eliminate over 15% of the regional and functional roles at the top two layers, and 60 committees, freeing up over tens of thousands of people hours annually. We have identified about 1,000, or 50%, of our internal financial -heads and dual reporting lines to enable faster decision-making. We are cascading these changes through the organization at pace. We announced the first two layers in September and the next set of changes will be implemented by mid-November, and we aim to bring the entire process to a close by early next year. When we speak in January, Mark and I will be in a position to update you on the financial and other metrics showing the impact of the simplification, amongst other details. While expense is not the primary driver of the organizational changes, they will help us start bending the expense curve in the fourth quarter of next year. And at the end of the work, we will have a simpler firm, that can operate faster, better serve our clients and unlock value for our shareholders. We have made tough decisions here. I want to note how pleased I have been with how the leaders of the firm, especially the next generation, have embraced these changes and are stepping up to implement them. They fully understand that we need to change how we run Citi in order to truly transform it once and for all. Before I close, I would like to address our people in Israel. We are a significant bank in the country and many of our people have lost friends and loved ones. Others are being called up to serve. Despite all that they are dealing with, they are keeping our bank running in the country. I am frankly in awe of their commitment to our clients and each other. More broadly, the price innocent civilians are paying as this crisis unfolds is absolutely devastating to witness. With that, I would like to turn it over to Mark and then we would be delighted, as always, to take your questions.","billion, , revenue, net income, liquidity, trillion, cet1",yes,Yes,cet1,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,Yes,cet1 ratio
2023,Q3,Mark Mason,"Thanks, Jane and good morning, everyone. I am going to start with the Firmwide financial results, focusing on year-over-year comparisons for the third quarter unless I indicate otherwise, and then spend a little more time on the businesses. On slide 4, we show financial results for the full firm. In the third quarter, we reported net income of approximately $3.5 billion, EPS of $1.63 and an RoTCE of 7.7% on $20.1 billion of revenues. Embedded in these results are divestiture-related impacts of approximately $214 million, after-tax, primarily driven by the Taiwan consumer business sale. Excluding these items, EPS was $1.52 with an RoTCE of 7.2%. In the quarter, total revenues increased by 9% on a reported basis and 10% excluding divestiture-related impacts, driven by strength across Services, Cards and Markets, as well as modest growth in Banking, partially offset by the revenue reduction from the closed exits and wind-downs. Our results include expenses of $13.5 billion, up 6% on a reported basis and $13.4 billion excluding divesture-related costs, also up 6%. Cost of credit was approximately $1.8 billion, up 35%, primarily driven by the continued normalization in Card net credit losses and volume growth. At the end of the quarter, we had over $20 billion in total reserves with a reserve-to-funded loans ratio of approximately 2.7%. And year to-date, we reported an RoTCE of 8.3%. On slide 5, we show expense drivers for the third quarter as well as our key investment themes. Expenses were up 6% and our level of expenses continue to be driven by a number of factors, including: Investments in Transformation as well as risk and controls, Business-led and enterprise-led investments Macro factors, including inflation and FX, Severance, which was approximately $190 million in the quarter and roughly $640 million on a year-to-date basis. This included actions across Banking, Markets, Wealth and the functions. And all of this was partially offset by productivity savings and expense reductions from the closed exits and wind-downs. And our technology spend across the firm was $3 billion in the quarter, up 8%, largely driven by investments in product development, platform enhancements and improving the client experience. Also driving the increase is continued investment in technology for the Transformation as we address the consent orders and modernize the firm. As we said last quarter, our Transformation and technology investments span the following themes: Platform and process simplification, Security and infrastructure modernization, Client experience enhancements, and data improvements. And we remain in line with our full year guidance of roughly $54 billion, excluding divestiture-related impacts and the FDIC special assessment. In the third quarter, net interest income decreased by $72 million. Excluding Markets, net interest income increased $332 million, primarily driven by: Growth in PBWM, as we continue to see loan growth and higher loan spreads, a pickup in Services driven by higher deposit spreads, as a result of higher interest rates and active beta management, partially offset by reductions from closed exits and wind-downs. Average loans were up 1%, largely driven by growth in U.S. Personal Banking across Cards and Retail Banking, as well as TTS. Average deposits were down 2%, largely driven by Services, as we saw non-operational deposit outflows, as expected, in light of quantitative tightening. And our net interest margin increased 1 basis point. On slide 7, we show key consumer and corporate credit metrics. We are well reserved for the current environment with over $20 billion of total reserves. Our reserves-to-funded loans ratio is nearly 2.7%. And within that, U.S. Cards is 7.8%. In PBWM, 45% of our loans are in US cards and of that exposure, 80% is to consumers with FICO scores of 680 or higher. And both Branded Cards and Retail Services NCL rates are still below pre-COVID levels but are normalizing in line with our expectations. The remaining 55% of our PBWM loans are largely in Wealth, predominantly in mortgages and margin lending. In our ICG portfolio, of our total exposure, approximately 85% is investment grade. Of the international exposure, approximately 90% is investment grade or exposure to multinational clients or their subsidiaries. Corporate non-accrual loans increased by $490 million but remain low at 68 basis points of total corporate loans. And we ended the quarter with a reserve-to-funded loan ratio of approximately 1%. As you can see on the page, we break out our Commercial Real Estate lending exposures across ICG and PBWM which totals approximately $65 billion, of which 86% is investment grade with a total reserve to funded loan ratio of 1.4%. To give you a sense of the macro scenarios that underpin our over $20 billion of reserves, our current scenario-weighted average unemployment rate is approximately 5%, which includes a downside scenario with an average unemployment rate of roughly 7%. So, while the macro and geopolitical environment remains uncertain, we feel very good about our asset quality, exposures and reserve levels and we continuously review and stress the portfolio under a range of scenarios. On slide 8, we show our summary balance sheet and key capital and liquidity metrics. We maintain a very strong $2.4 trillion balance sheet which is funded in part by a well-diversified $1.3 trillion deposit base across regions, industries, customers and account types which is deployed into high-quality, diversified assets. Our balance sheet reflects our strategy and well diversified business model. We leverage our unique assets and capabilities to serve corporates, financial institutions, investors, and individuals with global needs. The majority of our deposits, $782 billion, are institutional and operational in nature and span across 90 countries. These institutional deposits are complemented by $416 billion of U.S. Personal Banking and global wealth deposits. We have approximately $569 billion of HQLA and approximately $666 billion of loans and we maintain total liquidity resources of $937 billion. Our LCR was 117%. We ended the quarter with a 13.5% CET1 ratio, based on Standardized RWA, which is our binding constraint. Although not binding, our Advanced RWA did increase this quarter, largely driven by business activity. And our tangible book value per share was $86.90, up 8% from a year ago. On slide 9, we show a sequential CET1 walk to provide more detail on the drivers this quarter. Starting from the end of the second quarter. First, we generated $3.2 billion of net income to common which added 28 basis points. Second, we returned $1.5 billion in the form of common dividends and share repurchases, which drove a reduction of about 13 basis points, and finally, the remaining 2 basis point increase was primarily driven by lower DTA deductions and a net reduction in RWA. We ended the quarter with a 13.5% CET1 capital ratio, approximately 120 basis points or $14 billion above our current r a minute on capital. We continue to optimize our RWA and capital which we expect to be a tailwind over time. Contributing to this, is the execution of our strategy, such as further diversifying our business mix and simplifying our business model including exiting our 14 international consumer markets. Our investments in the Transformation will continue to enhance our data, analytics and stress testing capabilities enabling continued capital optimization. And of course, in light of the evolving regulatory environment we are also looking at other mitigating actions but those will largely depend on how the final capital rules play out. These actions could include exiting or restructuring certain products, divesting certain equity investments, and reevaluating both how we deploy capital and our management buffer. demonstrated our ability to manage our RWA and capital levels through various macro environments and the evolving regulatory landscape and will continue to do so. On slide 10, we show the results for our Institutional Clients Group for the third quarter. Revenues were up 12% this quarter, driven by double-digit growth across Services, Markets and Banking. In the quarter, normal course foreign currency translation impacts drove a net revenue headwind in ICG. On an ex-FX basis, ICG revenues would have been up 15%. Additionally, there was an approximately $180 million negative impact from the currency devaluation in Argentina on our net investment in the country mainly across TTS, Markets and Securities Services. Expenses increased 10%, primarily driven by continued investments in risk and controls and volume-related expenses, partially offset by productivity savings. Cost of credit was $196 million, including $51 million of net credit losses. This resulted in net income of approximately $2.4 billion, up 12%, driven by higher revenues, partially offset by higher expenses and higher cost of credit. Average loans were down 4%, as we were very deliberate about how we deployed resources across the businesses, including the reduction in subscription credit facilities. Average deposits were flat as new client acquisitions and deepening of relationships with existing clients were offset by non operational deposit outflows. ICG delivered an RoTCE of 10% for the quarter and 11% year-to-date. On slide 11, we show revenue performance by business and the key drivers we laid out at Investor Day. In Treasury and Trade Solutions, we recorded our highest revenue quarter in the last decade. Revenues were up 12%, driven by 17% growth in net interest income. Non-interest revenues were up 1%, and on an ex-FX basis, non-interest revenues would have been up 8%. We continue to see healthy underlying drivers in TTS that indicate consistently strong client activity with Cross-border flows up 16%, outpacing global GDP growth. And year-to-date, cross-border flows are up 12% U.S. Dollar Clearing Volumes are up 6%, both year-over-year in the quarter and year-to-date and commercial card volumes are up 8% year-over-year, driven by growth in business-to-business payments and travel and entertainment spend. And year-to date commercial card volumes are up 20%. In fact, similar to the last few quarters, client wins are up approximately 40% across all client segments. We continued to make good progress on our commercial client strategy, as year-to-date wins more than doubled, driven by expansion into new markets, and growth in multi-product mandates from clients with cross border needs. In Securities Services, revenues were up 16%, driven by higher net interest income across currencies. Non-interest revenues were up 3%. We are very pleased with the progress we are seeing in Securities Services as we continue to onboard assets under custody and administration, which are up approximately 10% or $2.1 trillion Markets revenues were up 10%, driven by Fixed Income. Fixed Income revenues were up 14%, largely driven by strength in our Rates and Currencies franchise. While volatility remained subdued versus a year ago, we did see overall volatility tick higher relative to the beginning of the quarter Equities revenues were down 3%, driven by a decline in Equity Derivatives, partially offset by growth in Cash and Prime. And we continued to make solid progress on our revenue-to-RWA target. And finally, Banking revenues, excluding gains and losses on loan hedges, were up 17%, driven by Investment Banking, which increased 34% on a reported basis and 12% excluding marks. Here too, we saw a pickup in activity in the last couple of weeks of the quarter, particularly in DCM but also in M&A as we closed a few deals earlier than expected. So overall, while the market environment remains challenging and there is more work to be done, we are making solid progress against our strategy in these businesses. Now turning to slide 12, we show the results for our Personal Banking & Wealth Management business. Revenues were up 10%, driven by net interest income growth of 9% and a 20% increase in non-interest revenue, primarily due to lower partner payments in Retail Services and higher investment product revenues in Wealth. Expenses were up 5%, predominantly driven by risk and control investments, and severance, partially offset by productivity savings. Cost of credit was $1.5 billion, driven by higher net credit losses as we continue to see normalization in our card portfolios. Average loans increased 7% driven by cards, mortgages and installment lending. Average deposits decreased 2%, largely reflecting our clients putting cash to work in investments on our platform. And PBWM delivered an RoTCE of 8.8%, and 6.6% on a year-to-date basis. On slide 13, we show PBWM revenues by product as well as key business drivers and metrics. This quarter was our 5th consecutive quarter of double-digit growth in Personal Banking, driven by Cards. Branded Cards revenues were up 12%, primarily driven by higher net interest income. We continue to see strong underlying drivers with new account acquisitions up 5%, card spend volumes up 4% and average loans up 12%. Retail Services revenues were up 21%, driven by higher net interest income and lower partner payments on the heels of higher net credit losses. In the Card portfolios, we continue to see the investments we have been making as well as lower payment rates contribute to growth in interest-earning balances of 15% in Branded Cards and 12% in Retail Services. Retail Banking revenues decreased 3%, driven by the transfer of relationships and the associated deposits to our Wealth business, partially offset by higher deposit spreads. Wealth revenues were up 2%, driven by higher investment fees across all regions and segments, the benefit from relationships transferred from Retail Banking and higher lending revenue. We also saw strong net new inflows across all regions. And year-to-date, new client acquisitions were up almost 30% in the Private Bank and over 60% in Wealth at Work. Overall, we are pleased with the progress we are making across these businesses. On slide 14, we show results for Legacy Franchises. Revenues were down 13%, largely driven by the difference in one-time gain on sale impacts in the Asia Consumer businesses, as well as the reductions from closed consumer exits and wind-downs, partially offset by higher revenue in Mexico. It is worth noting that so appreciation, higher interest rates and volume growth. Ex-FX, Mexico revenues were up 16%. Expenses decreased 3%, primarily driven by closed consumer exits and wind-downs, partially offset by separation costs in Mexico and Mexican peso appreciation. And expenses in Mexico were up 27%, but ex-FX, expenses were up 11%. On slide 15, we show results for Corporate Other. Revenues increased, largely driven by the absence of mark-to-market impacts on certain derivative transactions in the prior year. And expenses decreased, largely driven by lower consulting fees. With one quarter remaining in the year, we continue to expect full-year revenues of $78 - $79 billion, excluding 2023 divestiture-related impacts. Having said that, based on what we have seen play out year-to-date in terms of US and non-US rates and lagging non-US betas, we now expect net interest income to be slightly above $47.5 billion for the full year excluding Markets. And we are maintaining our expense guidance of roughly $54 billion, excluding 2023 divestiture-related impacts and the FDIC special assessment. Net credit losses in Cards should continue to normalize, with both portfolios reaching pre-COVID levels by year-end. And as it relates to buybacks, we expect to do a modest level of buybacks in the fourth quarter. a few points. We are executing on our strategy and delivering top line revenue growth of 5%, year-to-date. We continue to invest for the long term with discipline while remaining on track to deliver on our expense","capital ratio, billion, , revenue, net income, liquidity, million, loan growth, trillion, net interest income, cet1",yes,Yes,"cet1, capital ratio",Yes,lcr,No,,No,,No,,Yes,fdic,No,,Yes,"cet1 ratio, lcr, net interest margin"
2023,Q3,"Question And Answer
Operator",And our first question comes from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Mike Mayo,"Hi. Jane, you spoke more about the restructuring that you commented on recently. The real question is, why is this restructuring different than the other 5 or 10 or 15 restructurings we've heard about since Citi's creation in its current form 25 years ago, I think, just like a week ago? So, I'd say, why is this different? We hear the talk about cascading downward and the simplification, reducing dual heads and the committees. But we've heard this so much that why is this time different?",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Jane Fraser,"Yeah. It's a very important question, Mike, thank you for asking it. As I've said, we view these as the most consequential changes we've made, not just to our organization model, but how we run the bank, in almost two decades. And the first piece is simple, which is our org model was set up for a financial supermarket,that is simply not the bank we are today. So we are aligning the organizational model with that simper business mix and strategy. But what's truly different is we're changing how we run the bank. And these are permanent changes that will be driven all the way down through the organization. So let me give you some examples to bring it to life. We talked about delayering the first two or three layers of the bank. That will continue through the organization, through the spans and layers, particularly getting rid of aggregator roles. And let me give an example: HR, we had HR in a region, you had the region head, you had the Institutional Client Group head, you had the Banking head, in addition, you had a North Asia head and a South Asia head. We're just going to have the North Asia head and the South Asia head. And all of those roles collapsed into those two. We're eliminating activities in the geographies that we just don't need anymore, because we are no longer running local consumer franchises in them. So, let's take the financial reporting, sorry, the management reporting that Mark and I referred to in the opening remarks. We can reduce our management reports by about 50%. That's 1,000 reports. What does that mean? Shadow P&Ls by country, quarterly outlooks, monthly performance updates, all the associated tracking and reconciliations that are there that are effectively for a shadow P&L, rather than the one that matters to our shareholders. And so, that greatly declutters. It also means we can eliminate processes for our Transformation, where we are looking at how do we automate those processes, automate those controls. If they're a duplicative process, we're getting rid of them so we don't need to do that anymore and it will accelerate the work on Transformation. We are taking activities out of some of the businesses and centralizing them. A lot of the client activities that will go embedded into a business, we move that up to centralized utilities that the whole firm can benefit from and that will get scale economies. These strategy teams, marketing teams, many of the little cottage industries that build up over time. We can speed up decision-making with fewer committee layers. We'll take down the number of layers and drive that from some places 13, we're looking to getting to 8 in as many places as we possibly can. We're giving clarity of decision rights and changing decision rights from two or more people to just one. So much more single points of accountability, again more aligned with our shareholder interests, because those points of accountability are more sitting in the products. And the types of metrics we are looking at to help us measure this spans layers, revenue producers and non producers, grade mixes, synergies that we're realizing, voice of the client, but I say that our expectations and our execution of the business strategy is also at the heart of what we're trying to drive here. Our strength is our global network. I don't want our geographies focused on the full monty of management processes that are a duplication of what's happening in the product organization. I want them focused on delivering to our clients, engaging with our clients and also managing their responsibilities of the legal entities. The same way for our Banking organization. Putting the Investment Bank, the Corporate Bank and Commercial Bank together will really make it easier for us to realize the synergies across them. So, the cross sell or the movement of a commercial mid-market company up to a corporate lending company and a corporate banking company, much easier when they're all in the same organization. Or selling our Banking products suite into that Commercial Bank customer and other examples. So, it's really changing decision-making, freeing up people to focus on clients and Transformation, much greater transparency, changing decision-making and rights, driving synergies. We put a huge amount of work all the way through the summer in design as to how do we want the organization to work. That is now getting driven down into the designing in detail and in depth all of these types of activities through the second and third layers at the moment into the fourth and then until we finish at the end of the first quarter.",revenue,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Operator,And our next question comes from Glenn Schorr with Evercore.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Glenn Schorr,"So, I'm curious, you mentioned that you're still marching towards the 11%, 12%, which is good because everyone was going to ask that. My question is a little bit different of, with the denominator going up 25%, in other words, a lot of things are working towards your Transformation, but there's sort of a curve ball in there with upping the denominator by 25%. So, you seem to be a beneficiary of higher for longer for sure. And you also mentioned you're working on mitigation as we speak. So, maybe you could talk about what are the offsets that we don't see that give you confidence still working towards that, because the top line stuff is working?",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Mark Mason,"So, good morning, Glenn, it's good to hear from you. Let me make a couple comments on that, and then, Jane, feel free to chime in if you'd like. The first thing is that when I talked about this at the last conference we attended, I mentioned that analysts were somewhere in the 16% to 19% range in terms of a capital increase, and we're likely to be inside of that range, assuming the Basel III proposal as i s structured, as it's written, and obviously that's not the final, there's a period of review that's going on now. What I'd say is a couple things, Glenn. One, we haven't fully executed against the strategy that Jane has just described. And obviously, continuing to simplify the business, managing through the Transformation, changing that business mix that we have to something that's more consistent and predictable and repeatable as it relates to PPNR, those things matter and impact the SCB. We talked about the exiting of the international consumer businesses. That will be a factor in what our balance sheet looks like and what stress losses might look like as well as lowering the expense base, which we know is an important factor in that PPNR math as well. And so, those things help, I think, to reduce the amount of capital that might be required as we get into that medium-term period. Importantly, as you point out, there are other elements of the proposal that are going to require that we take a hard look at as well and identify mitigating actions to the extent that they make it into the final. So, think about the increase in operational risk and the fact that some of that is already included in SCB as something of a point of advocacy. But that's obviously a big headwind that we'll have to kind of work through, the FRTB and the enhancement of models. Now, there's a global market shock as well, but again another point of advocacy that we need to work through. The equity investments, and now that they go from 100% risk weighting to 400% risk weighting, I think we're going to take a hard look at whether those are worth keeping in light of the higher capital associated with them. That's going to challenge the returns, that's going to force us to look at those through a different strategic lens, and we're going to do that. And that's not to even mention the credit component that impacts both corporates and consumers as it relates to unfunded commitments, for example. And so, as we've done with SA-CCR and other types of reg changes, we're going to have to look at what it means for our product mix, the returns associated with those, whether there are opportunities to pull levers like pricing, or whether we have to take other decisions around those. And so, that's what I mean by the mitigating actions that we're dimensioning and putting on paper and working through, but again, want to be thoughtful because the rule is not final yet, and there are more discussions to be had around those important elements that I mentioned already.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,Yes,basel iii,No,
2023,Q3,Operator,And our next question comes from Erika Najarian with UBS.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Erika Najarian,"Good morning. You've talked a lot about defense, as I like to call it, in terms of the Transformation that Jane had outlined and bending the expense curve. But I'm wondering, for both Jane and Mark, if you could sort of address what I think is probably the most debated part of your target, which is that revenue CAGR of 5%. You put up a very nice quarter in terms of revenues, both net interest income and fees. And maybe help us sort of look underneath the surface in terms of that momentum and maybe break it down in terms of what's really going well. I think TTS continues to surprise to the upside, are we going to be, two years from now, we re going to be like, oh, well, TTS is continuing to be doing well. So, what are the businesses that really sort of strong secular momentum that you feel is being under-recognized versus how you could position cyclically and higher for longer? And what is still to come as we think about that path to at least the numerator of that RoTCE target?","revenue, net interest income",no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Jane Fraser,"I love this question, Erika, because I have to say I m really excited about our strategy and the potential it has. And it is, as you say, this is about the revenue potential of the firm and really how do we continue to unlock it. So, there s a couple of unstoppable trends that we re going to be riding in the next, I think it s decade-long. The corporate client of today, and indeed consumer, has to build resiliency. The multinational client is on a long-term trend of building resiliency, be it because of green, be it because of geopolitics, be it because of regulatory, whatever the different reasons may be, and there are multiple, they're having to build resiliency into supply chains, into their own operations as they operate around the world. W the bank that is absolutely there for them. And I think you've seen that in TTS, where we've had such strong drivers of growth in the last few years at the beginning of this trend. So, that is an important one. Wherever the clients want to go, we are there. We have been there for decades. We understand the risk. We understand the client base. We understand the opportunities there, at that. That micro level and local levels that someone who is flying in with a suitcase can't possibly deliver. And it's connected globally. So, this thing is just a thing of beauty. Linked into it is what I think of as a hidden gem amongst our crown jewels is Securities Services. It equally in custody has this extraordinary global network, the connectivity everywhere. We have been investing behind this business. We've been growing our market share in North America in asset managers, where we've been underweight, with a number of material marquee wins. You can see the share gain that we're getting in this business, the pipeline of deals that we've already won as well as the new pipelines going forward. Very high return. We're investing both in terms of our cloud, our data, our client experience. And this is in a way, let's say, I do view this as a hidden gem with extremely attractive return profile, fee profile, and other dimensions to it. We've quite a long way to run here. So, similar story to TTS, slightly different client base, competitively advantaged because you've got both the pre-trade and the post-trade. We connect the two. Huge efficiencies for clients. That's going to matter. Next trend that's unstoppable, global wealth creation. And there is just going to be massive global wealth creation. I can't tell you how excited Andy Sieg is now that he's in the building and knows the way to his desk and all the floors his people are on. He's about to hit the road globally. We are so well positioned to deliver against that. And as you can see, we've not been happy with our performance the last couple of years, but this is going to be a very important driver for us. We'll see the recovery in banking wallet eventually. None of us are calling when that will sustainably happen. That will be another driver. And I'd say cards continuing to go from strength to strength, particularly I think as we look forward, playing to our lending-led model there. And finally the other one I do love, which is our Commercial Bank. We serve these entrepreneurs all over the world, who are going to be the drivers of many industries going forward. And we're serving them, helping them go international for the first step, tap them into global supply chains and the like. It's almost by definition the fastest growing of the mid-market companies are the ones that tap into what we can offer them. We build great relationships with them. And then our private bankers call on them, and then our investment bankers call on them. We have our capital market teams calling on them. And we help them grow and succeed. And that is going to be a big engine in the medium-term of new client acquisition feeding us. So, deeper client relationships, more growth in terms of new clients that fit with our proposition fairly uniquely, and some great mega trends that we are going to be riding and pretty uniquely positioned on. And we'll keep investing to make sure that where areas we're behind we get into the forefront of and the areas we are crushing it in, like our win rate is 82% in TTS, and we're going to make sure that we continue to do so and innovate that way. So, sorry to be so excited about this, the 4% to 5% just feels very, very doable to Mark and I.",revenue,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Operator,And our next question comes from Jim Mitchell with Seaport Global.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Jim Mitchell,"Hey good morning. Mark, maybe on the revenue discussion there, let's talk about NII a little bit. You guys have a very unique deposit base, a lot smaller footprint in low-cost consumer. Betas have been, already been high, so it doesn't seem like there's as much beta catch-up risk for you. It's 50% non-US roughly. How do you think about the trajectory of NII, do you think it stabilizes next year before rate cuts? How do we think about the puts and takes on your NII into next year?",revenue,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Mark Mason,"Yeah, thanks for the question. Look. I'm not going to give guidance for 2024, we'll do that obviously at the fourth quarter 2023 earnings. But I think it's reasonable to expect that some of the trends that we've seen so far will continue. So, if you think about what's underneath this, we'll continue to benefit from higher rates across currencies. I think we'll continue to see benefits from card interest-earning balance growth. Recall that when you look at our US dollar IRE position, it's relatively neutral at this point. And interest earning balance growth is expected to be driven by continued card spend and lower payment rates. And so, I think what's important to remember, as it relates to our business, is that it's global. That we've got, while you're right in that, on the U.S. dollar side, we've seen betas kind of reach, particularly for our corporate clients, reach terminal levels at the end of last year. On the non-US dollar side, betas run lower. They lag. And there's still upside there because it's a different rate curve and a different pace of increases. And so, those will be some of the puts and takes to think about. Volumes, the rates, the speed of the curve moves, and then how betas evolve, that will kind of factor in.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Operator,And our next question comes from Ryan Kenny with Morgan Stanley.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Ryan Kenny,"Hey good morning. On the capital markets side, I heard the comments around it being hard to predict when deal activity will sustainably rebound. Can you just give us an update or more color on how CEOs are thinking about bringing deals live across M&A, ECM and DCM? And does the market and rate volatility over the last few weeks have any significant impact on bringing deals to completion or on the pipeline?",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Jane Fraser,"Well, I think a couple pieces. I actually start with Q3 is the seventh quarter of the current IB downturn. So, since 2000, downturns have tended not to last longer than seven quarters because that's often how long it takes for pricing expectations to fully adjust to new realities. And we're starting to see that particularly in the debt capital markets, investment grade markets, where the expectation of no longer how high, but how long for rates, we've seen clients who get off the sidelines and just bite the bullet and get into the debt capital markets in a more meaningful way and no longer waiting on that. We still think that how our recovery and return to normal wallet plays out, when you talk to CEOs, is largely dependent on the macro environment. That's the main piece for them. ECM, we're seeing increased interest and activity on ECM. You obviously had several IPOs coming to market in September, three big ones that we were involved in. But the marketis still somewhat fragile. We're watching it closely. And quite a few questions in Q4, things may move to Q1. We just have to see how that unfolds. But there's a good pipeline. I mean, there's a lot of pent-up demand here. In debt, we had a big pick-up in DCM. We feel confident that the gradual recovery in DCM and the beginnings of that lev fin one will continue. You're certainly going the see us more active in the lev fin space in the right situations for our key clients. And then in M&A, a healthy M&A sell-side pipeline. A lot of companies with their industries transforming are really wanting to think big. I think we'll see that unlocking when sentiment improves further, companies do accept the new pricing reality, which will be helped by a rebound in equity markets. That obviously, from our end, takes quite a few quarters to materialize into revenue just given the nature of the product. So, it's there, but I think just given where everything is geopolitically and particularly from the macro, no one is going to make that call as to when we're going to see that sustainable turn in banking at this point.",revenue,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Operator,And our next question comes from Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Steven Chubak,"Hi good morning. So, Mark and Jane, I do recognize you'll provide a more fulsome update on expense actions next quarter, but one of the things I was hoping was that you could frame the expense opportunity in the context of your headcount trends. And prior to COVID, as well as the consent order, mind you, Citi was running with 200,000 direct staff. That number is closer to 240,000 today. It's an increase of 20%, even with multiple divestitures that you've consummated. So how should we think about an appropriate target or an optimal level of headcount for Citi versus that pre-COVID baseline of 200,000, and whether the consent order would impact the timing or magnitude of such headcount actions?",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Mark Mason,"So, look, I'm not going to give you headcount guidance, but what I will say is Jane has talked before about the heads associated with the divestitures that are underway. And obviously as we continue to progress in those divestitures, we've made a lot of progress already, we'll see those heads come down. It's also important to point out that as part of our effort, there's been in-sourcing. And so, we've captured the extended workforce in the headcount that we have here. And then I think the final point is that as we continue to execute against the Transformation work, and as we implement the org simplification that we've just announced, undoubtedly the technology investment, the automation that we're putting in place, the straight-through processing that occurs, the fewer reconciliations that are required, the streamlining from all of those layers that Jane mentioned we'll be eliminating, all of those things will also work to reduce headcount as well. And so, while we're investing and hiring on the front-end to capture the upside as markets turn, but also as we position ourselves to grow with clients, we're also going to realize efficiencies that come out of headcount reduction. One additional point is that you've heard me mention before that we've taken probably about $600 million or so year-to-date in repositioning charges. And with that will come roughly 7,000 or so headcount coming down associated with those repositioning charges. And so, and we'll continue to do that, by the way, we haven't even begun to take repositioning charges associated with the org simplification that's underway. That will come in the fourth quarter and then the first quarter of next year. And so, we will see heads continue to evolve through this process, but keep in mind that there are puts and takes associated with that as we look at where we need to in-source versus use external parties.",million,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Operator,And our next question comes from Ebrahim Poonawala with Bank of America.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Ebrahim Poonawala,"Good morning.Just maybe, Mark, following up on that, as we think about bending the curve through the end of next year, maybe if you can talk to around as we think about the puts and takes between investments and expense saves, how much of that cost save or bending the curve is going to happen in Legacy versus PBWM and ICG? Like, just how do you break, how should we think about that as we think about bending the curve and where the savings are coming from?",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Mark Mason,"Well, look, next year, we talked about expenses coming down from third quarter to fourth quarter. And as we think about that, you'll have some of the benefits of the costs going away from the exits that we would have announced. You have some of the benefit from further reduction in stranded cost, which we've been keenly focused on as we've exited each of these. And then I think as we get to the medium term, you will start to see some of the benefits from the Transformation spend and investments that we would have made start to play out, as well as efficiencies that we start to get in a lower structural cost base. But again, that's in that medium-term period. So, all of those things will be drivers to getting the bending of the curve. I haven't broken down, I'm not going to break down here on this call how much comes from each of the pieces, but all are important factors to achieving that.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Operator,"And our next question comes from Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. : Hi. There were some quotes, I think, in the media, Jane, from you talking about some signs of pressure among the lower end of the consumer, and I appreciate the pie chart that you have in the deck showing it's not a huge percent of the card portfolio. But could you elaborate on that? And then also just address the, you mentioned directionally how the payment rates in cards are coming down, but if we look at the growth in spend versus the growth in loans, it is kind of a little disproportionate. I think spend is up a couple percent year-over-year, and the loans are 11%. So, as we think about being kind of later-cycle, is that something that you're paying attention to as a potential sign of further weakness in credit?",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Jane Fraser,"Yeah. Look, I think most of the pressure in the lower FICO, we don't have a lot of customers in lower FICO, so, we're seeing it out in the market. We've got, we obviously have some in the Retail Services business, we also, I would say, have the benefit of that loss sharing agreement that really makes a difference there because we're having to reserve fully for that, but we get it back on the revenue line, as you know. But as we look at the off-us book, as we look at some of the pressures in the market, as we look at spending, we can certainly see some of that pressure for the lower FICO, whereas when I think about the cards business, it's very much driven by the affluent customer. So, the affluent is accounting for almost all the spending growth that we're seeing. And that's similar for the numbers that we saw coming out of the Fed from the deposit side, the excess savings are sitting there now primarily with households with over $150,000 of income, and it's down in the rest. So, these are things we're keeping an eye on. I want to be very clear, I'm not that worried about it for Citi given the prime nature of our card portfolio, and then the rest of our PBWM exposure is obviously very affluent. But when I look out at the market, I talk to our corporate clients, that's where we tend to see them being more nervous about the softness in the consumer. And just, I call it they're much more mindful about where they're spending, right? So, you're seeing them moving down within a category. They're certainly looking more on the bargain front. We've been hearing that from our retail partners. We've been hearing that across the board. So, growth of card loans is good. Our spend is up, but less than loans. I think it's softening, but it's not worrying.",", revenue",yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Mark Mason,"Yeah. I think that's spot on, Jane. The only thing I'd add is that when you look at the payment rates in Branded Cards, while they've started to come down, they're still above the pre-COVID level. And we obviously have invested in this business. So, the other thing that's driving this is the new account acquisitions are obviously important drivers of that spend volume and ultimately that loan growth. But again, there's nothing that we see outside of what we were expecting in terms of how this portfolio is normalizing.",loan growth,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Operator,Our next question comes from Gerard Cassidy with RBC.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Gerard Cassidy,"Good morning, Jane and good morning Mark. Jane, as you pointed out, you're very excited about the opportunities in TTS. You're winning some new mandates in the custody business. Can you feel is it because the competition is struggling with other issues? What gives you, because Citi has always been well-regarded in this area, so what gives you that added excitement that this is even getting better?",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Jane Fraser,"Look, I think the added excitement is, a lot of it's coming from the investments that we've been making. So that we are, if you look at it in terms of Payment Express, which is live in the U.S., Thailand, on track for three more markets, that is really a very differentiating capability. The momentum we have in 24/7 clearing that's been put in place, we've had over $1 billion processed year-to-date. Putting our Commercial Bank clients onto CitiDirect so they have seamless access to our whole TTS network globally. You heard us talking about Citi Token Services, you can see us innovating with the Fed in new capabilities. So really across the board, it's that innovation in cutting-edge, first-in-the-market type of capabilities. But you're putting that on top of a network that's just unprecedented in terms of its presence, its local capabilities, its payroll, cash management, liquidity management, its collections, its receivables, all sitting on one platform connected globally. And what that gives a client in terms of efficiency saves, insights on data, what they can do in terms of risk management and how to really optimize their treasury capabilities. I mean, this thing is a thing of beauty. And it's very, very hard, it's very sticky,to extricate from this because it's embedded into how our clients do business, it's that critical and into their technology systems. So, when you look at where the world's headed and what's going on in the world, volatility, these other elements, it's hard not to see opportunities. And it's opportunities as well with our Markets business linked in. One of our really differentiating factors that Andy Morton talks about all the time is his partnership with TTS. The fact that one of our major client bases are corporates and they have a different profile, let's say, to an asset manager or a hedge fund. And we uniquely can serve them. So, that's the piece. It's that combination in trends we see.","billion, liquidity",yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Mark Mason,"I think that's spot on, Jane. The only thing I'd add is that the middle market commercial space is a huge opportunity for us, as you said earlier, leveraging that TTS platform. And then on the Securities Services side, the reality is that we're finally seeing real traction in North America, right? We've always had kind of strength in many of the other regions, but we're really winning some major mandates here in North America, which I think is enough to get really excited about.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Jane Fraser,"And I think that, to me, is what then drives a lot of the strategy and what we're trying to do in terms of get to that high quality of earnings, better earnings mix, and other pieces that will help us get to that medium-term return target that we are so focused on.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Operator,Our next question comes from Vivek Juneja with JP Morgan.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Vivek Juneja,"Hi Jane. Hi Mark. Want to just clarify the reorganization a little bit. So, Jane, I heard you say that you're keeping North Asia and South Asia heads. So, did you just get rid of the Asia head and get rid of the product heads, where product heads in each country were reporting to a regional product head? So, is that that dotted line is no longer there or what's going on there? And when you get rid of all the monthly management reporting, what are you planning to replace that with from your management, your MIS perspective?",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Jane Fraser,"So, let me take the second one first. I'm not planning on replacing it with anything. We don't need them. We're no longer running consumer franchises in the countries. Instead, we've got global businesses that are operating very consistently in the individual geographies, so we just don't need to replace them. And it enables us just to have the legal entity, financial management that we need. And then our internal reports get greatly simplified. Same as they get greatly simplified by taking out ICG and PBWM is another, eliminating that layer also eliminates a lot of different reports. So, the wonderful answer is, nothing, a simpler Citi. The first question was about, okay, help you understand what we've done. So, on the geography front, we have done two main things already. One is we've eliminated the regions and have just put a single international head reporting to me. So, that makes it much simpler for me. I have one international head, and then he will help us manage the geographies collectively. The second piece is we really narrowed the mandate of geography to delivering to our clients and covering our clients in their countries. And secondly, the legal entity management. And otherwise, before, we had a huge amount of management on shadow P&Ls and different, a lot of very heavy committee structure. That was necessary because the business was still very local, as a retail bank, a local credit card business, a local onshore wealth business. They've gone. It's just serving multinationals. The subsidiaries are multinationals and in some markets the investors and the wealth clients in some markets. And that's a much simpler business to manage. So, we could get rid of the regional layer, and we just jump straight down to the clusters that we have today. They too have less of a mandate than they had before, a much more focused one. And the bit that I'm excited about is not just, yes, this makes it much simpler to manage, but it also helps us really focus on the global network. Now, our geographies and our banking organizations sitting together on the same management structure are collectively accountable for serving and delivering against our core client base. And they're in one team to do it. It just makes it much easier. Does that give you a feel? What else, Mark?",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Mark Mason,"The other thing, Vivek, that I think is important here is we really want to spend a little bit more investment in time on the client lens in terms of the financial reporting, right? Because, as Jane talked about, we talked about the synergies across the franchise that we can capture, the ability to leverage the offering we have for those different client segments. So, looking at that P&L, looking at those returns, looking at that growth opportunity through that client lens will be something where we want to enhance the metrics that we have already around that so that we can capture that upside.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Jane Fraser,"And around the other piece that I think is also just an important point, globalization is changing and we're seeing these lanes all changing through trade, financial flows, et cetera. By actually having a single international organization and then the different clusters, North and South Asia, Europe, UK, LATAM, Middle East, Africa, the connection points between them are really changing at the moment. And so, this makes us much more agile in our delivery of the global network because I think it's much more in line with how the world is operating today.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Operator,And our next question comes from Saul Martinez with HSBC.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Saul Martinez,"Hi there. So, I wanted to continue on the thread of normalization of credit losses. And you guys have, I guess your guidance is implying that Branded Cards and Retail Services get back to more normalized levels by year-end, which is a decent-sized uptick over the levels you had in the third quarter. So, I kind of want to know what's driving that view. But more importantly I guess, what does that imply going forward? And does it imply that we get to more, something more like above trend losses? Because I would think we still have some seasoning to go on the late 2021 and 2022 vintages. And not only that, talking about this in an environment where we still have pretty extraordinary labor markets. So, if you could just give us a little bit more color on just your expectations on credit losses and whether there's maybe a little bit more risk than we're thinking in terms of losses trending to something that is a bit higher than what we normally, or what are more normalized levels?",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Mark Mason,"Yes. So, let me start on that, and then, Jane, if you want to chime in, that's fine. I think what I'd point you to is page 24 in the deck that we have because it gives you a nice snapshot of how both the loss rates have been trending but also how the delinquencies have been trending. And you can see that the delinquencies have been trending up, and that kind of gives us a good indication of where loss rates are likely to trend in the next quarter or so. And so, at 2.72% on Branded Cards and 4.53% on Retail Services, we can see that we're likely to end up at about that normalized rate by the end of the year getting up to the 3-3.25%, 5-5.50% pre-COVID normalized NCL rates. Our expectation is that as we go into 2024, to the point that you've made, depending on the macro environment, we're likely to see this tick up above those pre-COVID normalized rates, as we see a slowdown in the economy, again, subject to what the macro looks like, before then kind of settling down at some point, down the path. And so, yes, we do see that tick up. This is again as advertised, so to speak, as we would have expected. And we have reserves, significant reserves for both of these portfolios to account for those loss expectations. So, in Branded Cards, we sit with an ACL to loan reserve of 6.3%, and Retail Services, we have 11%. Jane mentioned earlier that the losses in Retail Services ultimately get shared with partners. And so, while we would expect this to normalize and mature, so to speak, we feel very well-reserved for what that might look like.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Jane Fraser,"And our portfolio is very prime. I mean, this is not the old Citi. It's very different in terms of our consumer credit exposure. And I think what you're hearing from us is, this should all be very manageable. We're not, there's no alarm bells going off at Citi around this. We're being prudent. We're being conservative around pieces and responsible on it. But there's no alarm bells ringing. And I think that there may be a bit of a disconnect from some of the questions out there versus how we're feeling. We're just not seeing the data that is overly concerning. This is all very manageable, and we're being prudent about it, as you'd expect us to be.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Operator,And our next question comes from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Jane Fraser,"Yeah, look, we remain confident around our ability to hit these targets. We've got, you heard me talk earlier around the revenue growth and what are some of the tailwinds that we've got behind us as well as the core strategy and the drivers that we're in control of and that we've been investing behind to achieve. So, our strategy is unchanged, we're confident it will drive the revenue growth of 4% to 5%. It's not the primary purpose, but the org simplification is the third driver of the expense reductions that we've talked about. And I would also say that when you look at revenue, expenses, and the targets we've laid out at Investor Day, we've certainly had plenty of headwinds in macro, regulatory, geopolitics in the last couple of years. We have delivered on what we said we would do in the revenue, in the expense guidance, and on the strategy. We've made adaptions along the way as we've needed to. But I think that's the piece that we're also really trying to drive into the firm is a culture of we will do what we say we will do, and we'll adapt accordingly to different areas. Mark talked about adapting to the capital requirements, depending on what they are. We have other levers that we can pull, capital allocation, management buffer, DTA. But my message to our investors is we're just building a proof point. This is a relentless execution. Look at that strategy scorecard page at the beginning of the deck there. We've achieved a lot and there is a lot going on, and we're getting a lot done. We don't pretend we're at the end of the road there, we're there yet. But we're getting done what we said we'd do and building up those proof points so that you can see us achieve those return targets. Anything to add, Mark?",revenue,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Mark Mason,"As you said, building credibility and being transparent, right? So, we're going to keep delivering on the proof points, and we're going to be transparent about how and when and how we're going to achieve it.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Operator,And our next question comes from Gerard Cassidy with RBC.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Gerard Cassidy,"Mark, you mentioned in the credit section that the delinquencies are rising, and as a percentage of loans, they're still very low. I was just curious on the corporate loans in North America there was an uptick. Again, I know relative to the portfolio, it's not that big. But anything in particular you can share with us in that area?",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Mark Mason,"On the corporate loans, we saw loss, I think losses were $51 million in the quarter, so a small amount. We did see an uptick, as you point out, in the reserves. That was really driven by some country rating adjustments that were made. And then we did see an increase in the NALs, the non-accrual loans. And that was really one or two names and one in North America, one in EMEA. Both of them are current. But they drove the uptick that we saw in the quarter there.",million,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Operator,And there are no further questions in the queue. I will turn the call over to Jenn Landis for closing remarks.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Jennifer Landis,"Thank you, all, for joining us. If you have any follow-up questions, please contact IR. Thank you.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Jane Fraser,"Thank you, Jenn, and a very good morning to everyone. Well, we certainly live in interesting times. And while I usually start our calls with our views on the global macro environment, we are particularly proud of our progress this quarter, and so I shall start there. Indeed, in a pivotal year, this quarter contains multiple proof points that we are moving in the right direction and that our strategy is delivering concrete results. We saw revenue growth and positive operating leverage for the firm and across all five businesses. Our businesses performed well as the rate cutting cycle began, with a double-digit increase in fee-based revenues, reflecting the growing diversity of our earnings mix. We continue to have share gains in Services and Banking. In Wealth, we saw a sizeable increase in client investments and flows. We brought expenses down whilst continuing to invest in our transformation. And we continued to attract top leaders in the industry and successfully combine them with our own teams in Banking and Wealth. So, while we are not yet where we want to be, the impact of the changes we are making is clearly evident in our momentum and improving performance. Turning to the macro, now while growth is a notch slower than last year, global economic performance continues to be surprisingly resilient. Whatever you want to call the US landing, the sentiment around it is more optimistic, supported by the recent positive payrolls report. And we see a healthy yet more discerning US consumer, and a US corporate sector on its front foot. Manufacturing weakness is restraining a modest rebound in Europe which continues to struggle with more structural challenges around its competitiveness, as highlighted by Draghi’s report. In China, consumer sentiment and the property market remain a concern as markets await details on the expected fiscal stimulus. India, Asean, Japan, the Middle East, Mexico and Brazil are all notable global bright spots. Today we reported net income of $3.2 billion and earnings per share of $1.51 with an ROTCE of 7%. Overall revenues grew by 3% ex-divestitures, with each of our core businesses delivering growth and positive operating leverage. While we continue to make substantial investments in our transformation, the efficiencies gained from our simplification and other efforts drove a 2% reduction in overall expenses. Turning to the five businesses, Services delivered a record quarter with revenues up by 8%. Fee growth, the best indicator of underlying momentum, was significant. And this, combined with loan and deposit volume growth, drove this quarter’s excellent performance. Treasury and Trade Solutions was up 4% year over year reflecting good underlying momentum in the core drivers. And Securities Services was up 24%, reflecting the benefit of new mandates and an increase in assets under custody. Both TTS and Securities Services achieved over 10% wallet share in our target markets through the first half of the year. Last week we announced that we are the first global bank to complete the integration of our cross-border services with Mastercard Move. Now, this will ultimately enable near-instant, secure payments to the vast Mastercard debit network, starting with 14 markets with more to come early next year. And this is another great example of our continued investment in market-leading product innovations. In Markets, revenues were up slightly on the back of a better-than- expected September. Equities was up 32% with robust performance across all products. Our continued strong performance in Equities validates both our strategy and execution to grow Prime and Cash. Fixed Income however was down 6% — our Rates and Currencies business didn’t match last year’s standout performance. It was a particularly pleasing quarter in Banking. Despite the muted IPO market, Investment Banking fees are up 44% driven by investment grade debt issuance as our clients pulled forward activity ahead of the U.S. election. Corporate sentiment remains positive as boards pursue strategic transactions, such as the $36 billion Mars acquisition of Kellanova, where we are the sole advisor and lead financier. Our strategy in Banking continues to gain momentum, and we are steadily growing our share in key target sectors such as healthcare and tech, with a healthy pipeline ahead. And the significant upside of our franchise continues to attract the top talent to Citi. During the quarter, we announced an innovative $25 billion private credit partnership with our longtime client Apollo, giving us the ability to source new transactions without using our balance sheet. This partnership positions us with another solution for debt financing for our clients, and it allow us to engage in private credit with the same depth and expertise as we currently do with syndicated debt markets. We are also starting to see the positive impact of the significant changes we’ve implemented in our Wealth franchise, with revenues up 9%. It’s a notable example of the traction I referenced earlier. As Andy and the team intensify the focus on our investments business, we grew client investment assets by 24%. And we were particularly pleased with the performance in Asia and in Citigold. I continue to be excited by the opportunities and the sheer potential of our franchise. During the quarter, we signed an agreement to exit trust administration and fiduciary services as we continue to sharpen the focus of our Wealth business. We have more to do to reach our medium-term margin and returns targets, but this quarter is a good indicator that we are on the way there. U.S. Personal Banking revenues were up 3%. We grew Branded Cards revenues by 8% with account acquisitions, spend and payment rates all driving higher interest-earning balances. Lower discretionary spending is impacting our Retail Services portfolio; however, we continue to see lower payment rates contributing to interest earning balances. In Retail Banking, we are growing our mortgage portfolio as the rate environment shifts, as well as growing overall loans. The U.S. consumer dynamics remain remarkably consistent with prior quarters. Our customers are healthy but more discerning in their spend, with signs of stress isolated to the lower FICOs. We have maintained strong credit discipline, and our card portfolios continue to perform very much in line with our expectations. In terms of capital, while uncertainty about the Basel 3 endgame prevails, our capital position remains very robust, and we ended the quarter with a CET1 ratio of 13.7%. During the quarter, we returned $2.1 billion in capital, including the repurchase of $1 billion of common shares. We will continue to repurchase stock as we evaluate the right level on a quarterly basis. As you know, our Transformation is our number one priority. This quarter we closed another long-standing consent order which related to the effectiveness of our anti-money laundering systems. We have increased our investments in areas where we have not made sufficient progress, such as data quality management. I and the management team remain steadfast and determined to get this Transformation right and to get this done. We will close out this pivotal year with momentum and with determination to continue to improve performance in each business and the firm overall. We are committed to meeting our revenue and expense targets for the year as well as our return target for the medium-term. I am very proud of our senior leadership and the entire organization as we demonstrate the potential of our unique global franchise. It is a privilege to lead this firm. With that, I would like to turn it over to Mark and then we would be delighted, as always, to take your questions.","billion, , revenue, net income, cet1",yes,Yes,cet1,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,Yes,cet1 ratio
2024,Q3,Mark Mason,"Thanks, Jane and good morning, everyone. I am going to start with the firmwide financial results, focusing on year-over-year comparisons for the third quarter unless I indicate otherwise, and then spend a little more time on the businesses. On slide 5, we show financial results for the full firm. For the quarter, we reported net income of approximately $3.2 billion, EPS of $1.51 and an RoTCE of 7.0% on $20.3 billion of revenues. Total revenues were up 1% on a reported basis. Excluding divestiture-related impacts, revenues were up 3%, driven by growth across each of our businesses. As you can see on the bottom left side of the page, net interest income excluding Markets was down 1% YoY, largely due to lower interest rates in Argentina. And non-interest revenue excluding Markets was up 9% as we continued to see strong fee momentum across Services, Banking and Wealth. Year-to-date, revenues are up 1% on a reported basis, and are up 3% excluding divestiture-related impacts. Expenses were $13.3 billion, down 2%, largely driven by savings associated with our organizational simplification and stranded cost reductions, partially offset by volume related expenses and continued investments in the Transformation and other risk and control initiatives. Year-to-date, expenses are up 1%, primarily driven by the FDIC special assessment and civil money penalties. Cost of credit was $2.7 billion, largely driven by net credit losses in Cards as well as ACL builds across the businesses, primarily for portfolio growth and mix. At the end of the quarter, we had over $22 billion in total reserves with a reserve-to-funded loans ratio of approximately 2.7%. And year-to-date, excluding the divesture related impacts, we generated positive operating leverage for the firm, and reported an RoTCE of 7.2%. On slide 6, we show the expense trend over the past five quarters. This quarter we reported expenses of $13.3 billion, down 2%, and 1% sequentially. As we’ve said before, we will continue to increase our investments to address data governance and data quality related to regulatory reporting and are committed to spending whatever is necessary to address these areas and the Transformation more broadly. Although a lot more work remains, we have started to see benefits from our prior investments play through. We’ve continued to simplify our technology infrastructure, retiring over 450 applications year-to-date and now over 1,250 since our 2022 Investor Day. We’ve upgraded 100% of our over 2,300 ATMs in North America and Asia Pacific to next-gen software for better customer security and monitoring. And we have streamlined our cloud onboarding process, reducing time to onboard applications to the public cloud from over 7 weeks to 2 weeks. Each of these initiatives will result in both improvement of our operating efficiency and our safety and soundness. And in terms of our full year expenses, we continue to expect that we will be at the higher end of the guidance range of $53.5 to 53.8 billion, excluding the FDIC special assessment and civil money penalties. And as we’ve said before, we, of course, will continue to look for opportunities to absorb the civil money penalties. On slide 7, we show net interest income, loans and deposits where I’ll speak to sequential variances. In the third quarter, net interest income declined 1%. Excluding Markets, net interest income was up 4%, largely driven by volume growth in USPB as well as higher deposit spreads in Services and Wealth. NIM declined by 8 basis points, driven by a decline in Markets due to seasonally higher dividends in the second quarter. Average loans were up 1%, driven by growth in Services and USPB, partially offset by modest declines in Banking and Legacy Franchises. Average deposits were roughly flat, as growth in Services was largely offset by a decline in Legacy Franchises. And as you think about guidance for NII ex-Markets in the fourth quarter: As short-end rates continue to come down, we expect a headwind on floating-rate assets which will be somewhat offset by disciplined deposit pricing. Further offsetting that will be a continued benefit from securities being reinvested at higher yields. And as a reminder, we expect an ongoing NII headwind as Legacy Franchises’ loans and deposits continue to come down. So, taking all of this into account, we expect NII ex Markets to be roughly flat sequentially in the fourth quarter, and for the full year to be slightly down, better than we had previously guided. On slide 8, we show key consumer and corporate credit metrics, which reflect our disciplined risk appetite framework. Across our Cards portfolio, approximately 85% of our loans are to consumers with FICO scores of 660 or higher. Based on what we see, the US consumer continues to remain healthy and resilient. Spend and payment rates continue to normalize, and underlying credit performance remains broadly in line with our expectations. NCLs increased year-over-year as card loan vintages that were originated over the last few years continue to mature at the same time. Sequentially, NCLs declined while delinquencies increased, both in-line with historical third quarter seasonality. Absent this seasonality, we continue to see stabilization in early-stage delinquencies. We remain well reserved with a reserve-to-funded loan ratio of approximately 8.2% for our U.S. Cards portfolio. Our Corporate portfolio is largely investment grade and corporate non accrual loans remained low, at 31 basis points. As such, we feel very comfortable with the over $22 billion of total reserves that we have in the current environment. Turning to slide 9, we provide details on our balance sheet, capital and liquidity, which are a reflection of our risk appetite, strategy and business model. Our $1.3 trillion deposit base is well-diversified across regions, industries, customers and account types. $840 billion are corporate, spanning 90 countries, and are crucial to how our clients fund their daily operations around the world. The majority of our remaining deposits, about $400 billion, are well-diversified across the Private Bank, Citigold, Retail and Wealth at Work offerings. And of our total deposits, roughly 70% are US dollar denominated with the remainder spanning over 60 currencies. Our asset mix also reflects our strong risk appetite framework. Our $689 billion loan portfolio is well-diversified across consumer and corporate loans. In the quarter, deposit growth outpaced loan growth resulting in higher cash balances which contributed to available liquidity resources of approximately $960 billion. We continue to feel very good about the strength of our balance sheet and the quality of our assets and liabilities, which position us well to serve our clients and execute on our growth strategy. On slide 10, we show the sequential CET1 walk to provide more detail on the drivers this quarter. First, we generated $3.0 billion of net income to common shareholders, which added 27 basis points. Second, we returned $2.1 billion in the form of common dividends and share repurchases, which drove a reduction of 18 basis points. Third, we generated 12 basis points from unrealized AFS gains. And finally, the remaining 9 basis point reduction was driven by an increase in RWA as we continue to invest in accretive growth opportunities. We ended the third quarter with a preliminary CET1 capital ratio of 13.7% relative to our target of 13.3%. As a reminder, effective October 1st, our new CET1 capital ratio requirement is 12.1%, and we still plan on holding a 100 basis point management buffer on top of that for now. As we think about the coming quarters, there are a few things that we will continue to consider as we manage our capital levels, including client demand as well as how the macro and Basel 3 Endgame evolves. We will take all of this into account as it relates to capital levels and the level of share repurchases on a quarter-by-quarter basis. Turning to the businesses on slide 11. In Services, revenues were up 8%, reflecting continued momentum across Securities Services and TTS, both of which continue to gain share through the first half of this year. Net interest income was roughly flat, as the benefit of higher deposit volumes was largely offset by a decline in interest rates in Argentina. On a sequential basis, net interest income was up 7%, driven by volume growth as we continue to onboard high-quality operating deposits and the benefit from higher deposit spreads. Non-interest revenue increased 33%, driven by a smaller impact from currency devaluation in Argentina as well as continued strength in underlying fee drivers in TTS and Securities Services. Excluding the impact of the Argentine Peso devaluation, NIR increased 11%, driven by growth in cross border transactions, US Dollar Clearing volumes and Commercial Card volumes. Expenses increased 3%, primarily driven by investments in technology, other risk and controls and product innovation, including the expansion of the CitiDirect Commercial Banking platform into additional markets. Cost of credit was $127 million, primarily driven by a build related to unremittable corporate dividends being held on behalf of clients. Average loans increased 5% primarily driven by continued demand for export and agency finance as well as working capital loans. Average deposits increased 4% as we continue to see growth in operating deposits. Services generated positive operating leverage and delivered net income of approximately $1.7 billion. And continues to deliver a high RoTCE, coming in at 26.4% for the quarter and 24.7% year-to-date. On slide 12, we show the results for Markets for the third quarter. Markets revenues were up 1%, driven by growth in Equities, partially offset by a decline in Fixed Income. Equities revenues increased 32%, driven by momentum in Prime with balances up approximately 22%, growth in Derivatives and higher Cash volumes. Fixed Income revenues decreased 6%, driven by Rates and Currencies, which was down 10%, partially offset by Spread Products and Other Fixed Income, which was up 5%. While Rates and Currencies declined from last year, which was the strongest third quarter in the previous 10 years, we did see good momentum in FX from increased corporate client activity. Spread Products and Other Fixed Income was higher driven by Financing and Securitization volumes and underwriting fees, partially offset by lower Commodities on lower gas volatility. Expenses increased 1% primarily due to higher volume related expenses. Cost of credit was $141 million, driven by an ACL build primarily related to portfolio mix in Spread Products. Average loans increased 10%, largely driven by asset-backed lending in Spread Products as well as margin loans in Equities. Average trading account assets increased 18%, largely driven by client demand for US Treasuries, foreign government securities and mortgage-backed securities. Markets generated another quarter of positive operating leverage and delivered net income of approximately $1.1 billion with an RoTCE of 7.9% for the quarter and 9.7% year-to-date. On slide 13, we show the results for Banking for the third quarter. Banking revenues were up 16%, largely driven by growth in Investment Banking. Investment Banking revenues were up 31% and fees were up 44%, with increases across Debt Capital Markets, Advisory and Equity Capital Markets. DCM benefited from continued strong Investment Grade issuance. Advisory benefited from strong announced deal volume earlier this year. And in ECM we saw stronger follow-on activity, which was offset by fewer IPOs amid market volatility in August. Both year-to-date and in the quarter, we’ve driven wallet share gains, including in the Healthcare and Technology sectors where we’ve been investing. Corporate Lending revenues, excluding mark-to-market on loan hedges, increased 5%, primarily driven by a smaller impact from currency devaluation in Argentina. Expenses decreased 9%, primarily driven by benefits of headcount reductions as we continued to right size the workforce and expense base. Cost of credit was $177 million, driven by an ACL build primarily for portfolio mix changes. Average loans decreased 1% as we maintained strict discipline around returns. Banking generated positive operating leverage for the third quarter in a row and delivered net income of $238 million with an RoTCE of 4.3% for the quarter and 7.2% year-to-date. On slide 14, we show the results for Wealth for the third quarter. As you can see from our performance this quarter, we are making good progress against our strategy and expect that momentum to continue. Revenue was up 9%, driven by a 15% increase in NIR as we grew investment fee revenues on momentum in client investment assets, which grew 24%. NII increased 6% driven by higher deposit volumes and spreads. Expenses decreased 4%, driven by the continued benefits of headcount reductions as we right size the workforce and expense base. Cost of credit was $33 million, largely driven by net credit losses of $27 million. End-of-period client balances increased 14%, driven by higher client investment assets and deposits, both in North America and internationally. Average deposits increased 4%, reflecting the transfer of relationships and the associated deposits from USPB, partially offset by a shift in deposits to higher-yielding investments on Citi’s platform. Average loans decreased 1%, as we continued to optimize capital usage. Wealth generated another quarter of positive operating leverage and delivered net income of $283 million with an RoTCE of 8.5% for the quarter and 6.8% year-to-date. On slide 15, we show the results for US Personal Banking for the third quarter. US Personal Banking revenues were up 3%, driven by NII growth of 2% and lower partner payments. Branded Cards revenues increased 8%, with interest-earning balance growth of 8% as payment rates continue to normalize and we continue to see growth in spend volumes, which were up 3%. Retail Services revenues were down 1%, due to a slowing growth rate in interest earning balances. Retail Banking revenues decreased 8%, driven by the transfer of relationships and the associated deposits to our Wealth business. Expenses decreased 1%, driven by continuous productivity focus, partially offset by higher volume-related expenses. Cost of credit was $1.9 billion, largely driven by net credit losses and a modest build for volume growth. We continue to expect Branded Cards to be in the 3.5% to 4.0% NCL range for the full year. In Retail Services, we continue to expect to be around the high end of the 5.75% to 6.25% range for the full year, driven by both the impact of persistent inflation and high interest rates as well as lower sales activity at our partners. Average deposits decreased 23%, largely driven by the transfer of relationships and the associated deposits to our Wealth business. USPB generated another quarter of positive operating leverage and delivered net income of $522 million with an RoTCE of 8.2% for the quarter and 5.2% year-to-date. As we’ve said before, the USPB segment creates a lot of value for the firm. We knew 2024 would be a tough year, as we lap the credit costs, but we have a path to higher returns. We will continue to drive revenue growth through product innovations while improving the operating efficiency of the business. And at the same time, we expect the credit environment to normalize. All of which will ultimately drive USPB to a high-teens return over the medium term. Slide 17 shows our full year 2024 outlook and medium-term guidance. We’ve generated $61.6 billion of revenue year-to-date, driven by NIR ex-Markets growth of 12%, and are on track to meet our $80 to 81 billion full year guidance. As I mentioned, we now expect NII ex-Markets to be slightly down for the full year. And with year-to-date expenses of $40.4 billion excluding the FDIC special assessment and civil money penalties, we continue to expect to be on the higher-end of our full year guidance range. As we take a step back, the third quarter represents another quarter of solid progress and a set of proof points towards improving firmwide and business performance. We remain focused on continuing to improve our performance and executing on our Transformation. These priorities remain critical to strengthening our operations and becoming a more efficient, agile and client-centric company as we continue to make progress on achieving our medium-term targets. With that, Jane and I will be happy to take your questions.","capital ratio, billion, , revenue, net income, liquidity, million, loan growth, trillion, net interest income, cet1",yes,Yes,"cet1, capital ratio",No,,No,,No,,No,,Yes,fdic,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Operator,"At this time, we will open the floor for questions. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question will come from Glenn Schorr with Evercore. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Glenn Schorr,"Hi. Thanks very much. Good guidance. I appreciate it. I'm curious on the card losses in Retail financial services, if you could talk to like, the 2024 exit rate seems like it will be higher than the full year guide at 6.25%. Maybe you could talk to the trajectory there and then the huge reserves that you have built in there and anything you can tell us about the portfolios so we can keep expectations in the right spot. Thanks.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Mark Mason,"Yeah, sure. Why don't I take that. Good morning, Glenn. So a couple things. So, one, I think that on Retail Services you're seeing a couple of things kind of play out. So, one, you're seeing kind of spend volumes trend down a bit. You are seeing payment rates come down as well. That obviously is fueling the average interest earning balance growth that we're seeing. And then you are also seeing with the spend volume come down, there's a denominator effect that plays through which pushes up obviously the loss rates that we're seeing. That still in the quarter is in line with our guidance but in light of what we saw earlier in the year and normal seasonality, we would expect that number to be on the higher end of that range and likely higher in the fourth quarter, but the higher in the fourth quarter again depends on what traffic is like and what the holiday spending season looks like through the end of the year. I would say the reserve levels we have are very healthy as it relates to this portfolio. I think in the back of the deck we show kind of the reserve to loan ratio at about 11.7% or so. So well-reserved for the Retail Services portfolio in light of the environment that we're in. Similarly, we are seeing the stabilization from a delinquency point of view across both portfolios kind of play through and so net-net, we are obviously actively managing this. The retail partner activity is a critical component of it and that will drive fourth quarter activity or levels, but we do feel as if we'll end up on the higher end of the range here.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Glenn Schorr,"Okay. Thanks for all that, Mark. Just one quickie On your partnership with Apollo, very interesting and in line with a lot of other things we've seen.

Appreciate it. Thank you.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Jane Fraser,"So we're delighted to partner with Apollo because what this does is it's uniting our comprehensive banking reach and expertise together and it's enabling us to offer our clients more innovative and tailored financing solutions.

We're always looking at how we can best serve our clients, give them the most options and this platform enhances corporate and sponsor clients access to the private lending capital pool at real scale in $25 billion is a very sizable partnership here and it provides funding certainty and strategic transactions. It's exclusive for LBOs, non-investment grade in the US. The US is obviously the bulk of the private credit market, it’s the behemoth globally.

2024,Q3,Operator,Our next question will come from Ebrahim Poonawala with Bank of America. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Ebrahim Poonawala,"Good morning. I guess maybe, Mark, for you, like looking at slide 7 on NII, and maybe we can break it down into Markets and ex-Markets. In the ex-Markets NII, $11.96 billion this quarter, based on what you've said, the back book repricing, deposit flex, is it safe to conclude that the ex-Markets NII bottomed in 2Q 2024? And I noticed the securities yield actually went lower, 7 bps quarter-over-quarter. So was there something one-off that impacted the yield this quarter relative to the expectations you outlined earlier?",billion,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Mark Mason,"So when you look at slide 7, you got a couple of things playing through. So your point around the low number, the low print, $11.46 billion in the second quarter, that really is a combination relative to first quarter of FX translation, some seasonally lower card balances, and lower interest payments in Argentina playing through that sequential 1Q to 2Q. The third quarter, as I mentioned earlier, is really a by-product of volumes on the lending side and spreads, deposit spreads in Services and Wealth and I think that I've already given kind of the guide for the fourth quarter where that is likely to be flat. But I think it's important to just remind everyone of the headwinds and tailwinds that play through this NII line. And from a tailwind point of view, I would expect to see continued volume from loans, USPB in particular but also Services and we're talking ex-Markets, so Services. I'd also expect to see continued benefit from the reinvestment of securities at higher yields and then we're actively managing beta as it relates to with our clients and if you think about kind of what we saw in the uptick of rates, we're actively managing that on the down tick as it relates to our institutional clients. I think the other point here is let's not forget that our interest rate sensitivity skews more towards non-US and so a lot of what we think about and talk about tends to be how US rates move and the betas around that. We're still going to have a bit of beta catch-up outside of the US and so that's one of the headwinds there as well as the Legacy Franchise exits. So you've got this long-winded way of saying, I do expect flat into the fourth quarter. I'm not going to give guidance for 2025. But what I will say is to keep the growth momentum to get to our medium-term targets, that's 4% to 5% of a CAGR and that's going to be a combination of NII and NIR but skewing NIR. And I want to point that out because the third quarter and the year-to-date numbers that you see in our performance shows very strong fee NIR growth across each of these five businesses and I don't want to lose sight of that as you all really try to get a handle on how we get to that medium term. We're evidencing that shift towards more fee revenue as we speak. So I'll stop there, but I think that's important and hopefully I've answered your question around the NII forecast here.","billion, revenue",yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Ebrahim Poonawala,"That's helpful. And agreed on the fee momentum. Just one quick on the Wealth segment. We've seen a considerable progress year-to-date in terms of going from zero ROE to about 8.5% RoTCE, significant operating leverage. I think I heard Jane say that momentum should continue. Is it fair to assume that RoTCE remains, like Wealth remains a positive story as we think about how Citi's ROE continues to improve from here as we get towards the target? Any color on the Wealth side would be helpful. Thank you.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Jane Fraser,"Yes, I agree with you. I think we're all very pleased to see the progress on the strategy we laid out at Investor Day. The Wealth target we have in the medium term is 15% to 20% and with that a 25% to 30% operating margin and we're making steady progress there. I think the first piece was putting the pieces of the global wealth organization together and now we're focused on positioning for growth and reshaping the business to deliver the returns that we all expect. A very important part of that is shifting our mix by growing investments. We had 24% growth in client investment assets this quarter. I would call that a good start to realizing the potential that we have here. And at the same time, Andy continues to right-size our expense base and drive productivity. Our advisor productivity increased over 50% in Citigold North America. So a number of different areas that he's focused on so that we can continue to grow the investment space including some important new talent that we've been bringing in that I'm sure you've noticed.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Operator,Our next question will come from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Mike Mayo,"Hi. What assurance can you give that Citi can both meet its 2026 expense guide, the $51 billion to $53 billion and I note the year-to-date run rate implies $54 billion. So getting from that $54 billion run rate down to the $51 billion to $53 billion by 2026 and meet its regulatory targets. In other words, assurance that Citi can both walk and chew gum at the same time. And I guess I'd highlight as you know, on October 2 Senator Warren asked the OCC to impose growth restrictions because Citi is ""too big to manage."" I would assume you don't agree with that, but still the question that a lot of people have is what assurances can you give that an asset cap won't happen at Citigroup? Thanks.",billion,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,Yes,occ,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Mark Mason,"Thanks, Mike. So why don't I start with your expense question and I'm sure Jane will chime in on some of the other parts of your question. So, look, we put out medium term targets of $51 billion to $53 billion in 2026, revenue dependent, of course, and that's consistent with the target we gave of less than 60% efficiency ratio. And we've got a target this year as you know on the high end of $53.8 billion [ex-FDIC special assessment and Civil Money Penalties]. And so we've got to get from $53.8 billion down to $51 billion to $53 billion by 2026. I'm not giving guidance for 2025 but you can expect that that will likely glide down to that number. What's driving the reduction? So we've talked before about $1.5 billion in savings largely related to the restructuring and driving down headcount reduction associated with that. We talked about another $500 million to $1 billion related to expense reductions from eliminating stranded cost as we continue to exit. We're out of nine of these consumer countries already. And we talk about starting to see efficiencies and benefits from the investments and the transformation and technology towards the end of 2026. And those are the three drivers that are important for us to continue to realize between now and 2026. Will there be headwinds? Yes. There will be, the transformation is a multiyear process. We're also investing in risk controls and regulatory spend to support improving our operations. Of course, there will be headwinds but there will also be things that we shift away from. There will be tailwinds associated with it. Jane mentioned some of the productivity efforts that both Andy as well as Vis are pushing on. You look across these businesses and you see positive operating leverage across the board. So that means that Andy Morton as well as Gonzalo are too looking at their cost structures, at expenses that they can take out or productivity that they might improve. And so there will be additional costs that we have to incur. We incurred additional costs this year. But there will also be additional productivity savings that we continue to tease out to ensure that we get to these targets.","billion, revenue, million",yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,Yes,fdic,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Jane Fraser,"And, Mike, let me pick up on part of the second part of the question in terms of the progress on the transformation. As you know, and as Mark's talked to you about, the transformation reverses historic underinvestment in Citi's infrastructure. It enhances our risk and control environment. And it's a strategic overhaul as we've talked about that goes well beyond the consent order to simplify and to strengthen Citi to the benefit of all of the stakeholders we have. We are already a very different Citi today. We've made enormous change over the past three years, dramatically simpler business model, significant org change so we align our structure to that model. We now have a flatter organization with greater accountability and as Mark talked about through the investments in our transformation, we're focused on simplifying our operational model, modernizing our infrastructure risk and controls and all of that reduces risk as we go. We're well on the way in executing the transformation plans. We've made meaningful progress as was acknowledged publicly by one of our regulators and it's a wide range book of work. We've made significant strides in areas such as risk management, compliance and accountability and that's well beyond the big bodies of work about consolidating our platforms. So we had 1,250 retired since 2022 as Mark mentioned. Other areas of progress, enhance our stress testing capabilities, they're faster, more frequent, more precise assessments. We put in place new target operating models for wholesale credit risk, enterprise risk, price risk firm wide. A huge body of work reducing risk and high risk processes such as payments and Markets through systemic preventative controls. We've been implementing the XiNG platform, this is the strategic cloud solution for market risk analytics. Values trades on demand and at scale. And we've embedded risk and controls into our performance management framework and tied that to compensation for the full firm. So these are just giving you a flavor of these big body of work that we are executing and getting done. I was very pleased that we closed the FRB, AML/BSA consent order particularly given heightened risk and scrutiny in this area. That is the third consent order we've closed since 2021 and we've been very transparent. Where there are areas in which our execution is delayed against our original timelines as is the case with our data work. We take a step back, determine what we need to change in those areas and get back on track and make relevant tech and people investments. So I feel very confident about the strategy we've laid out for the firm, the deliberate path we're on, the huge progress we've already made, and that we will continue making with determination and with clarity going forward.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Mike Mayo,"So, just one follow-up. When, and you do have the amended consent order that's not new anymore, but is this a problem with your dealing with clients or is this an issue with giving the regulators the information that they need? And just again, you don't, just to confirm, you don't have an asset cap now, is it fair to assume that you don't expect an asset cap any time soon or could you have an asset cap and we don't even know about that? Thanks.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Jane Fraser,"We don't have any problems dealing with our clients, quite the opposite. We're a source of strength for our clients in terms of the provision of their payments businesses, their trading businesses, their consumer credit businesses, all across the board. So I would say quite the opposite. We are a source of tremendous strength for them and you see that in the results of this quarter which were very pleasing across the board in every single one of our businesses. We are working closely with our regulators. We incorporate their feedback as well as our own lessons learned. If we fall behind in an element of the consent orders but do understand the breadth of the consent order work as I laid out and the meaningful progress we're making across multiple areas, and when we fall behind in an area we increase the investments needed and look at any lessons learned in the approach and address it. So I feel very comfortable.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Mark Mason,"So again, we don't have – we're not talking about issues as it relates to client information, client data, client reporting. We're not talking about information as it relates to financials. We're talking about regulatory reporting, all right. And regulatory reporting as I've mentioned in prior calls, we're a global firm. We've got over 11,000 regulatory reports and we're talking about ensuring that the data that we capture at trade entry is the data that's required to ultimately show up on these various regulatory reports in the way that we need it ensuring that we've got the proper controls on that front end so we don't have to do a lot of the reconciliation and manual adjustments to that data in order to get it how we needed in the report and ensuring we have standardized rules and controls around that process so that we can do it as efficiently as possible. But this is largely around ensuring that we improve those regulatory reports that we have to produce by starting with the underlying data that's required to do that.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Operator,Our next question will come from Jim Mitchell with Seaport Global. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Jim Mitchell,"Hey, good morning. Mark, consensus expectations, and it's just another expense question in a different way. But consensus has you not hitting your revenue growth targets and you're certainly free to disagree and I think that's fine. But they also have your expenses at the high end of your $51 billion to $53 billion range in 2026. I guess, does that make sense or do you feel confident that if revenues do sort of disappoint your targets that you could come in at the – you should or can come in at the lower end of that range to help get to your RoTCE target.","billion, revenue",no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Mark Mason,"Yeah. So, let's take it in pieces. So I think – the first thing is that, I think Jane and I have been very consistent with trying to give guidance on full year performance for the past couple years and we've largely actually delivered on that guidance. If you look at the top line growth since Investor Day, it's largely consistent with what we talked about in the medium term. If you look at the expense guidance that we've given, largely consistent with that including this year. Even as I look at the $80 billion to $81 billion revenue guidance we gave for the year, and you look at the $60.6 billion that we've done year-to-date, and you think about what we have to deliver in order to hit that target, that is achievable particularly when you remember that we had a large Argentina devaluation last year. That fee momentum required in the fourth quarter is very achievable and we believe that we will obviously hit the high end of the [expense] range for 2024. As I think about that outer year period and the guidance that we gave there, look, you all want proof points before you actually believe that we can deliver on that medium term target. I'm pointing you to proof points. I'm hopeful that as you see those proof points through 2024, full year and each of the quarters, that you will start to believe in that revenue momentum that's required in the medium term. The fee revenue is a very good indicator. What we delivered this year and this quarter is a very good indicator of the momentum we should see across these businesses in the next couple years. I also hope that you would then see that as we deliver on the expense target that we have a path to continuing to deliver on the medium-term expense target, the drivers of which I mentioned earlier. Yes, if revenues come in short of the target that we've set for ourselves, you would naturally expect for the volume and transaction related expenses and compensation expenses to come down in a commensurate way with that revenue decline and you would also expect that we would look to see if there are other productivity opportunities that we can tease out in order to still deliver on that operating efficiency target that we've set for ourselves.","billion, revenue",yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Jim Mitchell,"No, that's great color. I appreciate it. And maybe just as a follow-up on the capital question, I guess one thing that's been a bit of a headwind over the last year has been sort of growth from the DTA deductions. Do we start to see that become a tailwind again? How do we think about that accreting back into capital over the next couple of years?",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Mark Mason,"Yeah. Look, the main driver of our DTA utilization will be driving higher income in the US. That's going to be the major driver and as we think about – so as you think about each of the strategies that Jane has described for our business, you will often hear the importance of winning in the US. You'll hear it as it relates to Banking and the activity that we saw, the strong performance we saw this quarter in Vis’s world, you hear it as it relates to the Wealth business and the importance of us growing investments particularly in North America. You see it in USPB which is largely a US focused business. That DTA utilization is about us increasing net income or higher net income in the US and as we work to execute on our client driven strategy, we are looking for opportunities to do that. We're incenting the business to drive that momentum and that's what's going to give us a higher utilization on a quarter by quarter in the coming years.",net income,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Operator,Our next question will come from Erika Najarian with UBS. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Erika Najarian,"Hi. I think we've slid over to the afternoon. Good afternoon, guys. The first one is for you, Jane. As I speak with longer term investors, they often offer the commentary that clearly the path from the 7% RoTCE this quarter to the 11% to 12% hopefully will be bridged and to be able to initiate a position before that progress is made, they really sort of want to see more capital optimization. And this question is not really the same question I ask you about buybacks every quarter but really maybe a progress update on Banamex. So there is chatter in the market about Banamex needed to have four quarters of separate financials before being IPOed and I'm wondering if you could give us specific progress on how that's going? And Mark, maybe remind us on what Banamex's contribution is as we think about the unlocking that excess capital versus taking it out of the P&L.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Jane Fraser,"Yeah. I'd be delighted to, Erika. And I would also just before I jump into Banamex point to a laser focus on capital optimization. It's been a mantra for a long time in our Markets business, in Banking and a discipline that we've driven throughout the organization and I would say there isn't anyone at Citi that is not keenly aware of the focus around optimizing our capital. Returning to shareholders, particularly given where we're trading, and making sure that we drive to returns. So if I turn to Banamex, our singular focus right now is the separation of the two banks which we expect to complete in the fourth quarter of this year. This has been an enormous body of work because we are creating effectively de novo Mexico's eighth largest bank. We've just now gotten the core regulatory authorizations that we need to proceed with separation. Although there are a few other approvals pending. We are in the very final stages and are working with our clients to prepare them for this switchover later on in Q4. Once the separation is complete, we will turn our full attention to the IPO itself and the successful execution of the IPO is the highest priority for our Head of International, Ernesto Torres Cantú, to run Banamex. And our incoming Banamex Executive Chairman who starts this quarter, Ignacio Deschamps. We plan to be ready to IPO at the end of 2025 based on the factors that we can control but I think as Mark and I have always said, the timing is going to be driven by market conditions to ensure we maximize the shareholder value. And we're making the necessary investments to continue growing share and I was very pleased that Banamex outpaced the average market revenue growth year-to-date, good expense discipline being maintained despite the complex separation process and the environment. So I'm pleased with where we are and I hope that gives you a bit of a flavor of what the path ahead looks like.",revenue,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Mark Mason,"Yeah. In terms of the second part of your question, a couple things. So, one, we've been seeing good growth in our Mexico Consumer business. We've also been investing in it appropriately so to make sure that we protect the strength of that franchise as we prepare it for separation, ultimately for the IPO. Erika, if I understood your question right, if we turn to page 16 of the deck in the bottom right hand side, we show the P&L for Mexico Consumer for 2022 and 2023. And so you can see the contribution from a revenue and expense point of view so about $1.5 billion in 2023. And I think it's about $4 billion or so of TCE that we have associated with this business. So that gives you some sense for the contribution, but it continues to perform quite well as we manage it through this process.","billion, revenue",yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Erika Najarian,"Perfect. Thank you. And as a follow-up question, I'm sure it is frustrating for you to see the stock reaction in a quarter where you had PPNR strength and better expectations for net interest income in the fourth quarter. So maybe I'll frame the question this way for you, Mark. As we think about the gyrations in interest rate expectations globally, may be remind us sort of is it fair to assume that Citi is asset sensitive internationally and neutrally positioned domestically? How should we think about late fees? I know you told us that late fees going to $8 were part of your initial guide for the year. And additionally, I think perhaps because capital markets is so strong across the board, across all of your peers, maybe that's not why you're getting, ""credit for your strength this quarter"". So as we look into 2025 and having NIR be that bigger contribution to your revenue CAGR, maybe walk us through what are the other sort of core fee strengths that we should look for other than FICC and Banking remaining strong and coming back that could bring you to that path to 2026.",", revenue, net interest income",no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Mark Mason,"Okay. There's a lot there. But thank you. Thank you for the question. I would like to see the stock reacting much more favorably because this really has been a strong quarter for us and in fact as you mentioned, NII when you look through it, we've in fact taken our NII guidance up just a tad bit as we referenced that the full year would be slightly down versus modestly down with the fourth quarter that's flat to the third quarter and so that is an important takeaway. I mentioned the headwinds and tailwinds earlier and we shouldn't lose sight of those. We will get lift from reinvesting the securities as those mature, we will continue to see volume growth and those are important drivers of tailwind activity for us. You rightfully mentioned our interest rate exposure analysis that we do on a quarterly basis that reflects the asset sensitivity of our business. And last quarter it was about $1.6 billion or so of a negative, assuming 100 basis point decline across the curve, assuming a static balance sheet and cross-currencies. And as you look at that asset sensitivity, again, you rightfully pointed out that we skew non-US in terms of the magnitude of that decline in NII should we see that parallel shift. And in fact, it's as much as $1.3 billion or so of that $1.6 billion is non-US dollar related across 60 currencies. And so you'd have to see all of that move in tandem for that drag and the US dollar drag is about $300 million assuming 100 basis point shift and that's been coming down. If you look back over the quarters, we've been thoughtfully managing that down and that's down to about $300 million number. I would expect when we print the third quarter Q, it will be down a bit more. And so, again, we are asset sensitive but it does skew outside of the US and thank you for asking the question because I think it's important to remind our investors and analysts of that dynamic which in many ways may be different from that of other Institutions. In terms of the late fees, we did say that we were including late fees in our assumptions, in our outlook that we've given. I'll state the obvious Erika, which is that we want people to obviously pay on time and we do everything that we can to assist and ensure that they do that. With that said, we don't have a definitive timeline on late fees, nor are we overly reliant on late fees to drive revenue for our firm. And so it looks like that decisioning will likely kind of fall closer to sometime in 2025 and so there is a small adjustment in the last quarter of our revenue forecast but it's inside of the guidance that we gave and doesn't materially change that in any way. And then the last part of your question, I think, was around NIR and the fee revenue. And as I mentioned earlier, I'm not going to give guidance for 2025 but I think your question was around where are we likely to see continued momentum as it relates to fee revenue growth. And I would start with Services where fees were up some 33% year-over-year and yes we should adjust for the Argentine Peso devaluation. But even if you adjust for that it's double-digit, 11% year-over-year non-interest revenue growth. And when you look at those drivers they've been consistently strong. Cross-border transaction value up 8%, US dollar clearing volume up 7%, commercial card spend up 8%. In the supplement you'll see that it's mid to high single digit year-to-date growth across those KPIs as well. We expect that that will continue with our corporate clients and as we bring on new commercial clients as well. I'll turn you to – if you look at Banking, we talked about already so I won't kind of lean into that too much but except to highlight a really strong quarter in Banking, in Investment Banking fees, in particular, the rebound that we've been talking about but importantly us capturing share in that rebound and these important partnerships that position us well as sponsors start to lean back into the market the investments that we've been making in talent, in sectors we need to strengthen. All of those things are going to play to continued fee momentum as we go into 2025. Wealth, again, really strong performance this quarter with revenues up 9%. But look at the client investment assets, up 24%. The client balances up 14%. That's driving fee momentum and it's a keen area of focus for Andy and that team that he's pulled together and it's a real opportunity for us given the $5 trillion or so of assets that our clients hold away from us and we're better positioning ourselves to capture that. And then finally, you can see kind of continued momentum on USPB but it's across the board is what I'm saying, Erika, in terms of that fee momentum and it is important. It's an important aspect as we think about getting to those medium term targets and that 4% to 5% revenue.","billion, trillion, revenue, million",yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Operator,Our next question will come from Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Gerard Cassidy,"Hi, Mark, hi, Jane.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Mark Mason,Good morning.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Gerard Cassidy,"Mark, you touched on in your prepared comments about growing the US Personal Banking RoTCE to higher levels. And you mentioned two items. One, innovative products and the normalization of credit costs. Can you elaborate on those two items that will be contributing to the driver aside from the efficiency improvement that you also touched on?",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Mark Mason,"Yeah, sure. So obviously USPB is a combination of the cards businesses that we have in the Retail Banking business and that cards portfolio has both Branded as well as Retail Services as part of it. And even within Branded, we have proprietary cards where we frankly have been looking to how we can come up with new innovative products. One example of product innovation is the recent refresh that we did of our Strata Premier Card which was designed to drive acquisition and engagement with a new rewards offering. And with that acquisitions are up some 7% both quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year for Branded Cards so that's an example of product innovation. Another one is we also launched FlexPay at Costco a few quarters ago and you can see good instalment loan growth as a consequence of that, up some 15% or so. And so that type of product creation is important to acquisitions, it's important to ensuring the card stays top of wallet and important to driving some of that top line performance. And then the other thing that I mentioned, you're right was around cost of credit and that really is the continued normalization of cost of credit. I mentioned a couple of times now the idea that multiple vintages are maturing at the same time. And that has to play through for us to kind of see a more normal level of credit and that will be important to the returns. And again, we are starting to see stabilization in both the cost of credit line but also in delinquencies and that's a good indicator for us.",loan growth,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Gerard Cassidy,"Very good. And then just following up on credit. In the Banking division, you guys mentioned the cost of credit was, I think, $177 million due to ACL build of $141 million. And it was due to a change in the mix in the portfolio. Can you share with us what that mix change was that drove this provision?",million,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Mark Mason,It's a mix of kind of different asset classes and clients that we've lent against. There's nothing material or significant in that number. When you look at the nonaccrual loans that ratio still 31 basis points. So it's a mix change of our exposures but nothing material there.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,

2024,Q3,Vivek Juneja,"Hi. Two questions, Jane and Mark. One is on expenses and the other is on your response to the asset cap question before. So first one, expenses, an easier one. Earlier in the year you had said you expect about $700 million to $1 billion of severance charges in the $53.5 billion to $53.8 billion. Did you have any in the third quarter? Expect any if the fourth? And do you expect to be done with those this year or any to continue into next year too?","billion, million",no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Mark Mason,"Yeah. So that number was a combination of restructuring charges and severance charges or repositioning charges and we breakout obviously restructuring so that you can see those. And this restructuring component was largely driven by the org simplification. That will be done this year. The normal severance or repositioning charges that we take as a normal course of BAU you would expect that to occur in any year and it certainly will be part of 2025 and 2026 going forward. We did have some this quarter. I would expect that we will have some next quarter, but I don't see us being outside of by any stretch the range that I gave and again the range was for the combination of both.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Vivek Juneja,"Okay. Thanks on that. And shifting to the asset cap question, Jane and Mark, we didn't hear a clear answer on, A, do you have an asset cap? And B, even if you don't, what is the effective implication or impact of what the regulators have said?",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Vivek Juneja,"And you don't expect anything meaningful, Jane, that will impact business like there was this new story about China, some license that you didn't get approved by the regulators.

2024,Q3,Connor,"Hi. Just a couple of clarification questions. I guess first on Banamex, are you on track to still IPO it the fourth quarter of next year or does it just get pushed out by a quarter with the legal separation taking a little bit longer?",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Jane Fraser,"Look, I think as I mentioned in response to Erika's question, we plan to be ready to IPO at the end of 2025 based on the factors we can control. The timing is going to get driven by how we maximize shareholder value and that will be market conditions. So that's where we stand. MATT O'",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Connor,"Okay. I think that means by the end of 2025, you talk about 1Q 2026, that was kind of my clarification question on that. I thought you needed four quarters after you legally separated it to officially IPO it.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Jane Fraser,"We believe as we stand at the moment we would be ready to IPO at the end of 2025. It's much more a focus on what the market conditions at that point will be and Mark and I are very, very much focused on the shareholder value and maximizing that over – rushing over one quarter versus another quarter.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Mark Mason,"And there's no hard rule on – sorry, go ahead.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Jane Fraser,"Yes, there isn't a hard rule on you have to have got four quarters after you have separated. MATT O'",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Connor,"I see. Okay. That's super helpful. We just haven't had that many of these, so that's helpful. And then just separately I think in the prepared remarks you guys mentioned a modest provision within Services for some of the unremitted corporate dividends and I just wanted to clarify that and what country is that. And I guess I thought there wasn't really much liability to you guys from that, so any clarification on that. I know it's a small amount, but that would be helpful. Thank you.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Mark Mason,"Sure. It's a small amount. In the back of the deck, we have a page on Russia exposure. It's related to that. MATT O'",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Connor,"Okay. But still feel like there's not risk to you guys from all those kind of trapped dividends, I guess why take a small reserve if there's legally no risk to you guys?",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Mark Mason,"Well, it's the way we treat the exposure there. We're following the guidelines on how we need to treat exposures in the country that we aren't able to distribute to clients but we actually have to hold on their behalf. And so we have to book a reserve associated with that and so we do that. We obviously show on the page what the exposure is in the event of a loss of control and you can kind of see how that ultimately nets out but we're following the appropriate guidelines for what's required for reserves of that nature. MATT O'",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Connor,Got it. Okay. Thank you.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Mark Mason,Yeah.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Operator,Our next question comes from the line of Ryan Kenny with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Ryan Kenny,Hey. Thanks for taking my question. I have one for Mark. So you mentioned that Services NII is a tailwind as rates decline. Can you just unpack how that happens? Is there any benefit from swap roll-off or a floating swap that we should be thinking about that's embedded in that statement?,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Mark Mason,"There are a couple of things kind of to keep in mind on the Services business. So, one is, is obviously this is a client business. It's not just a deposit taking business and so how we think about pricing to those client becomes really important. You've got the US and non-US dynamic that's playing through. For institutional clients, we've largely been holding to the higher betas that we saw as rates have ticked up. Again, with the relationship in mind. And we have some offsetting pressure outside of the US as those betas kind of catch up. But I think importantly you also heard me mention the reinvestment into securities at higher yields and that reinvestment or those higher yields ultimately play out through the businesses and so that will show up as part of kind of NII as we think about Services but the other businesses as well. And so those are important components of the NII story for Services. I think when you look at the in-quarter performance and [TTS] NII is down 5%, a big part of that is driven by the Argentina rates movement in the quarter versus last year, so lower rates we're earning in Argentina playing through that line particularly in this quarter. If you adjusted for that on the NII line, it would be flat to slightly a little bit better. So that's really what it is. It's kind of management of client relationships as well as the higher earnings on reinvested securities contributing to that as well as volume from operating account growth that we expect.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Ryan Kenny,Thank you.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Operator,Our next question comes from the line of Saul Martinez with HSBC. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Saul Martinez,"Hey, guys. Couple quick questions. First, just a follow-up on Banamex. Jane, as you know, there are concerns about judicial reform in Mexico and the implications for rule of law and Mexican asset prices have suffered as a result. I think the largest Mexican bank trades at something in the neighborhood of seven times earnings. If market conditions don't improve and Mexican asset prices remain depressed and these concerns persist, then what? I mean, do you just wait until market conditions improve or how do you think about this process in the context of what seems to be a deteriorating macro backdrop for Mexico.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Jane Fraser,"Yeah. We've got to wait and see what the market conditions will be but the North Star for me and for Mark is crystal clear, it is optimizing and maximizing our shareholder value. So if the conditions are not appropriate at that time then we will wait until they are. In the meantime, the business is performing well. It's accretive to our returns. It's not a drag here in any shape or form so there is no need to rush for a suboptimal result here. But we will IPO and we will exit Banamex, but we won't do that in a reckless manner. We will be disciplined about it as you would expect us to be and as I think we're demonstrating that we are on multiple different dimensions.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Saul Martinez,"Okay. Fair enough. And then I guess a follow-up on the US Personal Banking, RoTCE improvement and the normalization of the cost of credit seems to be a big component of that. But Mark can you just remind us where you are in terms of cost of credit versus what you would think a more normalized level is for Branded Cards and Retail Services. I guess how much of a tailwind does a more normalized credit environment entail in terms of credit cost?",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Mark Mason,"Again, I don't want to get into 2025 at this stage. I assure you, we will give more color and commentary on that as we get into the fourth quarter earnings in January. What I will say again, as you think about these businesses, we do see continued top line – we do expect continued top line momentum. We've had eight consecutive quarters of positive operating leverage in USPB, 49% [efficiency ratio] this quarter. So we're managing the expense base well. We think there's more upside to the top line. We're very focused on growth across the portfolios and I do think that cost of credit again, if for no other reason but the compounding effect of those vintages maturing as well as kind of inflation starting to come off, rates trickling down, that should be better for the consumer and should start to play out in both the macroeconomic scenarios that we run for CECL purposes but also ultimately in delinquencies and NCLs and we're starting to see that improvement in delinquencies and its stabilization already somewhat. So I don't want to get into guidance. But that's kind of how I think about the drivers or contributors to improve returns over the medium term.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Operator,Our next question will come from the line of Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Mike Mayo,"Hi. Thanks for the clarification on the asset cap question that I asked earlier. And I know you are limited in how much you can say about regulators but just be clear, because a lot of e-mail traffic going back, you did say there is no asset cap and you don't expect one and you don't expect other additional actions at this time?",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Jane Fraser,Correct.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Mike Mayo,"Okay. Thank you for clarifying that. And I guess, look, I have great respect, I'm an ex-regulator, Paul Volcker was my hero. I respect regulators. And nobody wants to see you cut corners to get to your $51 billion to $53 billion of expenses. But I'm just wondering – and you have consolidated systems apps, layers, bureaucracy and you're divesting lots of activities. So it's just even the amended consent order was surprising because you have taken so many efforts and if you should have had an amended consent order or other actions, they probably should have been in place one, five, 10 or literally 20 years ago. And so that's just confusing on the outside. So with that said, is this a matter of spending more money or about doing these tasks more intelligently? In other words, you put more gas in the tank, the car's not going faster. So is it amount of resources or just being more intelligent in terms of resolving some of these regulatory issues?",billion,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Jane Fraser,"So let me break it down to a couple of pieces. So I start off just remind everyone the consent orders are very, very broad and the action that was taken was because we're behind in a narrower area which is the data particularly regarding our regulatory reporting where we're behind is the main area of focus. We moved swiftly to address it. We're very transparent about it from early on in the year that we were falling behind on this and overall I'm pleased with our progress. And as you say, Mike, I listed a number of areas of progress and trying to make it as tangible as we can, given what we can and can't say as this is supervisory. I'm pleased that our businesses continue to improve their performance while the transformation is going on. They're the two priorities we have this year so I think effectively, yes, we can walk and chew gum at the same time and the huge benefit of all of the simplification on the business, on the organization, the other efforts, is making it easier for us to execute and be very focused. And well maybe, Mark, I’ll pass it over to you.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Mark Mason,"I think your question's helpful in the sense that you said is it kind of a rethink on our approach or is it the need to spend more money and one of the things that we've done, Mike, is take a step back and look at how we've been approaching data, for example. So this is – and we are going to make – we have made some changes to our approach and those changes relate to how we get after resolving data issues that are identified ensuring that there's engagement from the front end business, from the functions that are most relevant and that there's consideration for what's required on reg reporting in order for us to get that process streamlined and correct. And so there are aspects of this that require a change in our approach and we've been taking that change, making that change rather, and we'll make more changes accordingly as we've taken that step back and there are aspects of it that require at a minimum review of what is causing either the delay or us not moving at the pace that we would like to move or that our regulators would like. And that is in fact what the resource review plan was that was in the amended consent order. It was basically a statement saying that you need to ensure that you have sufficient resources and that they're allocated towards achieving the timely and sustainable compliance. And so part of our process is in fact that. Taking a regular review of what is on track in the way of our milestones and deliverables where we see things that are being delayed or going red, what is the underlying root cause for why. Is it a resource issue where we need to put more dollars and people or technology to it? Is it a process issue where we need to reconsider our approach? And on the other side of that root cause, taking action to fix it. And so your question is spot-on. The answer is that in many instances it will be a little bit of both, but importantly our processes include that type of analysis and assessment so that we can get after the execution on this in an effective way. I hope that helps.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Jane Fraser,And all of this drives productivity and other benefits for our shareholders as well as making sure that we're strengthening Citi from the regulatory perspective.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Mike Mayo,"And then last follow-up. To the extent that you see a disconnect between your performance and the stock price that would seem to create more of an opportunity to buy the stock at $64 when tangible book value is $90. And so, I hope that – I've used this analogy before, but hopefully you're selling the chairs and the desk and the silverware in the executive dining room to go ahead and buy back stock whenever you can.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Jane Fraser,"It's clearly given where we are trading, we're very focused around the opportunities to buy back stock and mindful of the importance of it and equally, yes, we are proud of the performance of the franchise this quarter. It was a very strong quarter and important set of proof points for our investors. We are on a deliberate path. We're making the progress that we need to and actually pretty excited about the path ahead of us and the potential that we see.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Operator,There are no further questions. I'll now turn the call over to Jenn Landis for closing remarks.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Jennifer Landis,"Thank you, everyone, for joining the call. Please follow-up with IR if you have any additional questions. Thank you.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Jennifer Landis,"Thank you, operator. Good morning, and thank you all for joining us. I'd like to remind you that today's presentation, which is available for download on our website, citigroup.com, may contain forward-looking statements which are based on management's current expectation and are subject to uncertainty and changes in circumstances. Actual results may differ materially from these statements due to a variety of factors, including those described in our SEC filings. With that, I'll turn it over to Jane.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Jane Fraser,"Thanks, Jenn, and Happy New Year, everyone. I am delighted to join you again today. Well, we've been busy, and we have a lot to talk about today. I'm going to start with an update on our strategy refresh. Then, I'll share my thoughts on our fourth quarter, and end on all the progress that we've made against our major priorities. As you saw earlier this week, we announced that we intend to focus our franchise in Mexico solely on our Institutional and Wealth Management businesses, and therefore, to exit the consumer, small business, and middle-market banking operations there. This was not a decision we took lightly. We took a clinical look at our franchise in Mexico, and we drew the hard conclusion that the non-institutional businesses do not fit our new strategic direction. Now, to be clear, these are terrific, they're scaled, high-returning franchises, but our strategic goal is to invest in businesses that are fully aligned with our core strengths and to simplify our firm. As we did the work, it was also clear that there continues to be a tremendous opportunity for our Institutional Clients Group in Mexico. Citi is Mexico's leading institutional bank. We've served corporate clients and investors there for almost a century, and that isn't going to change. Mexico has a bright future, and we are committed to playing an important role in building it. We expect Mexico will be a major recipient of global investment and trade flows in the years ahead. Therefore, we plan to maintain a significant, locally-licensed bank there and invest to capture growth in a core and high-returning hub of our institutional network. This won't be a simple transaction. We have spent the last several months working through how to get the best results for our shareholders and be true to our local stakeholders. We will begin the separation process immediately and expect to begin the sales process in the spring, and of course, there will be an opportunity to return excess capital from the transaction to our shareholders. This is our final decision in terms of market exits as we conclude our strategy refresh and approach Investor Day. I'm really looking forward to talking to you about the future Citi on March 2. Today, we are going to talk you through the changes we are making to align our organization and financial reporting with our refresh strategy. These changes will also allow us to reduce structural complexity and its associated costs. Amongst other things, this is going to help make Citi easier for our investors to understand. You'll be able to see and assess more simply the core businesses that make up Citi going forward. First, we are creating a new Personal Banking and Wealth Management segment which will be run by Anand Selva. This will consist of two distinct reporting units, our US Personal Banking businesses and our Global Wealth Management business which is going to include the Private Bank. Second, on the institutional side of the house, which will continue to be run by Paco Ybarra, we will begin reporting under three units, services, banking, and markets. Services will include Treasury and Trade Solutions and Security Services, and this reflects just how important we believe these businesses are to Citi's future. Finally, we will create a new segment, Legacy Franchises, which will house all the businesses we intend to exit. We're going to begin reporting our financials along these segments and reporting units no later than the second quarter to ensure you have the information you need to measure our progress and hold us accountable, and we really look forward to sharing our strategy and plans for how these businesses will work together and deliver for our shareholders on Investor Day in March. Now, turning to earnings, we had a decent end to 2021. As you can see on slide 2, we closed out the quarter with net income of $3.2 billion and EPS of $1.46. That includes a $1.2 billion hit to EBIT primarily related to the winddown of our Korean consumer business. Excluding those impacts, our net income would be $4.2 billion with an EPS of $1.99. Our net income for the full year of $22 billion reflects an improved credit environment and we had a resulting RoTCE of 13.4%. In ICG, we had another strong quarter in Investment Banking and gained share for the year in M&A, and we continued to make significant investments in talent and we see a very solid pipeline of transactions ahead of us. Now, while we could have had a better balanced performance in Fixed Income in the quarter, equities finished 2021 up 25% for the year. The rebound TTS is seeing in trade flows and cash volumes wasn't quite enough to offset the current rate environment, but it bodes well for 2022. Indeed, we think the cycle has turned for this business and it is poised to benefit as monetary policy changes and growth accelerates. You've heard Mark and I talk about improving the revenue mix of our Institutional businesses as a priority, and it's yielding results with another quarter of strong momentum in fee growth across products. Lots of our consumer businesses are still weathering COVID disruptive impact on customer behavior. In the US, strong purchase sales continued to be offset by elevated payment rates, but we did see loans increase in Branded Cards this quarter. Deposits and AUM continued to grow, with digital deposits up nearly 20% for the full year. For the year, we returned nearly $12 billion in capital to our shareholders and we grew our tangible book value per share by 7% to $79.16. We ended the year with a CET1 ratio of 12.2% on a standardized basis as we built the capital needed to absorb the impact of SA-CCR. Now, keep in mind that regulatory change didn't take effect until January 1. While this caused us to temporarily pause our stock buybacks, we will resume buybacks this quarter now that that impact has been addressed. Finally, as slide 3 shows, we are executing and delivering against our priorities, a strategy refresh, the transformation, and our culture, and we are doing so with a real sense of urgency. First, on the strategy, we are laser-focused on swiftly and successfully implementing the strategic decisions we made over the past year to improve returns to our investors. We have signed deals in six of the Asia consumer markets, including the agreement to sell four markets that we announced yesterday. This means that within eight months of making the decision to exit these 13 businesses, we have a clear path in a majority of them and we are well into the process in the remaining markets. In Korea, we were decisive in determining the best path for our shareholders was the wind down our consumer operations and were able to get most of that charge behind us this quarter. Another area where we haven't wasted any time is Wealth Management, where we grew our ranks by a net 800 advisors, relationship managers, and others over the course of the year. They helped us add about 750 Private Bank clients and 45,000 Citigold clients in 2021. In what we've known as US Personal Banking, we're seeing good uptake of new products such as the Custom Cash Card and we've been building out digital platforms to capture opportunities in Installment Lending. And in addition to the progress we're seeing in TTS, we've also been building out our Security Services platform. We couldn't be more pleased to deepen our relationship with BlackRock by becoming the largest custodian with their iShares ETF. Second priority, we continue to execute on our transformation agenda in order to demonstrably strengthen our risk and controls as well as modernize our bank for a digital world. This work, it's foundational to everything we want to achieve. We are enhancing our operating model to improve long-term efficiency and our service to clients. As it relates to the consent orders, we are deep into execution mode. We continue to be in constructive dialogue with our regulators as we get their feedback and incorporate it into our ongoing execution and project plans. Third, and relatedly, we are building a culture that expects excellence and demands accountability. We're driving this effort in a variety of ways, including a more robust performance management process at this past year end, shifting the mix of compensation to better align with shareholders' interests, and various culture-changing initiatives. A culture of excellence also means creating a record of achievement that our people can be proud of. One area that our people take particular pride in is our ESG efforts. Later this month, we will share with you our plan to reach net zero by 2050, a commitment I made on my first day as CEO, 10 months ago. And of course, we are going to do all this with a singular focus on our clients as we help them navigate COVID. We certainly hope Omicron is the final disruptive phase of this pandemic, but there are also quite a few other issues to navigate, whether macroeconomic such as inflation or geopolitical such as tensions with Russia. We have seen the resilience and the importance of Citi as we supported our clients through uncharted waters and we will be with them in the next chapter as well. So now, I'd like to turn it over to Mark, and then we would be delighted to take your questions.","billion, , revenue, net income, cet1",yes,Yes,cet1,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,Yes,cet1 ratio
2021,Q4,Mark Mason,"Thanks, Jane, and good morning, everyone. We have a lot to cover on today's call. I'm going to start by walking you through the financial reporting changes we plan on making in more detail. Then, I'm going to walk you through the 2021 financial impact from the 13 Asia market exits, as well as Mexico, and changes we are making to our financial disclosure, and then finally, the quarterly results. As part of our strategy refresh, we've started to make changes to better align with our vision and strategy. We've refreshed our earnings presentation and included additional metrics and key drivers for the ICG businesses. Our goal is to simplify our financial reporting to make it much easier for our investors to understand our performance and our key assets. Turning to slide 4, we lay out the details of the changes in financial reporting that Jane mentioned. First, we intend to move the consumer, small business, and middle-market banking operations of Citibanamex and the 13 Asia consumer exits under a new segment called Legacy Franchises. This will allow you to better understand the financials of the remaining company that will exist post these exits. We've experienced managing businesses being divested and are putting a dedicated team in place to manage the new segment. This will free up the management teams of the go-forward businesses to fully focus on executing on the firm's strategy. Second, we are reorganizing our reporting units to help you better understand the financials of our businesses and the value they bring to Citi. Starting with ICG, we will move TTS and Security Services to a reporting unit called Services. These businesses are foundational for us as they have a unique position given their global footprint and full suite product offering. Markets will therefore no longer include Security Services and instead will only include equity and fixed income markets. And lastly, on ICG, banking will only include advisory, equity underwriting, debt underwriting and corporate lending. The Global Consumer Bank, GCB, will be renamed Personal Banking and Wealth Management, PBWM. The Private Bank will move from ICG to PBWM. As a reminder, we announced in January of last year that we created a single wealth management organization under Citi Global Wealth now called Global Wealth Management, which is a distinct reporting unit. The creation of this unit unifies the wealth management teams creating a single integrated platform serving clients across the wealth continuum from the affluent segment to the ultra-high net worth clients. North America Consumer will but renamed to US Personal Banking and will remain a reporting unit under PBWM. This unit will continue to include Branded Cards, Retail Services, and Retail Banking. We plan on providing the financials for the new reporting units on this page under the ICG and PBWM segments starting no later than the second quarter earnings. And our Investor Day will be a natural opportunity to bring together all the work over the past year and lay out our medium-term vision and strategy for the firm. Slide 5 shows the contribution of the Citibanamex businesses that we plan to exit as well as the contribution from the 13 Asia markets. Hopefully, this gives you a better sense of the financial results for the combined exits, and in the appendix on page 18, we have more detail on the 13 Asia exit markets and the deals that we've announced to date. Turning to Mexico, as Jane mentioned, we remain committed to Mexico and will continue to serve our Institutional and Private Bank clients there. That said, upon very careful consideration and analysis, we decided that we are no longer the optimal owner for the businesses that we're exiting. The Mexico consumer and small business banking operations included in the intended exit represents the entirety of the Latin America Global Consumer Banking unit and the Mexico middle-market banking business that is currently included in Citi's Institutional Clients Group segment. On the left side of the page, we show key figures for 2020 and 2021 for the businesses we intend to exit in Mexico. In 2021, the businesses contributed $4.7 billion of revenue and $1.1 billion of net income. The businesses in total had $20 billion of loans, $31 billion of deposits, and approximately $4 billion of allocated TCE. Again, we do not yet have a transaction and are pursuing multiple divestiture paths, so the ultimate financial impact of a transaction is not yet known. We will keep you updated on our progress as we run a thoughtful process that takes into consideration what is in the best interest of our shareholders as well as our clients and employees in Mexico. In addition to the opportunity to return additional capital to shareholders, these divestitures will also allow us to simplify the management and organizational structure across the firm. Now turning to slide 6, as we've gone through our strategy refresh and simplification, we've been reviewing our disclosure and terminology and have decided that now is the right time to more closely align with our peers. First, revenue that we previously referred to as Net Interest Revenue will now be called Net Interest Income, and revenue that we previously referred to as Non-NIR will now be called Non-Interest Revenue. Second, as you can see on the page, we've revised how we account for insurance paid on our deposits, including FDIC and foreign deposit insurance. We have previously accounted for the deposit insurance as a contra revenue in Net Interest Income. However, beginning this quarter, we will report it as an expense and remove it from Net Interest Income. And as a reminder, this change is earnings neutral. We've made this change to make it easier for you to compare us to our peers and we have revised prior years to reflect the same reporting treatment to assist with comparability for 2019 to 2021, and the rest of the presentation will also reflect these two changes. On slide 7, we show financial results for the full firm. As Jane mentioned earlier, in the fourth quarter, we reported net income of $3.2 billion and an EPS of $1.46 and RoTCE of 7.4% on $17 billion of revenues. Embedded in these results are costs of approximately $1.2 billion primarily related to the voluntary retirement program we offered in conjunction with the wind-down of our Korea consumer business as well as some additional Asia exit impacts which I will collectively refer to as the Asia divestiture impacts going forward. Excluding these impacts, EPS would have been $1.99 with an RoTCE of approximately 10%. In the quarter, total revenues increased by 1% from last year as strength in Non-Interest Revenue driven by ICG, specifically TTS, Security Services, and Investment Banking was mostly offset by lower Net Interest Income across GCB and ICG. Our results include expenses of $13.5 billion, an increase of 18% versus the prior year. Excluding the Asia divestiture cost, expenses would have increased by 8%. Increased expenses were largely driven by investments in our transformation, business-led investments, and higher revenue-related expenses partially offset by productivity savings. Cost of credit was a net benefit in the quarter, primarily driven by an ACL release of approximately $1.4 billion related to the improved macro backdrop and continued improvement in portfolio quality. Now turning to the full year, our revenues were down 5% driven by the normalization in markets, as well as elevated payment rates in consumer, somewhat offset by strong Non-Interest Revenue growth across ICG and in particular, in Investment Banking, TTS, and Security Services. Our full year expenses were up 9%, but excluding Asia divestiture costs, our expenses were up 6%. Also for the full year, we generated RoTCE of 13% and 14% excluding Asia-related divestiture impacts. As a reminder, we had a benefit of close to $9 billion in ACL releases for the full year. On slide 8, we show an expense walk for the full year with the key underlying drivers. In 2021, excluding Asia divestiture impacts, expenses were up 6%, in line with previous guidance. Looking forward, we recognize that we have a lot more work to do. The divestitures provide an opportunity to simplify our management and organizational structure. We're also taking a hard look at our structural expenses with an eye towards operating as efficiently and soundly as possible and self-funding investments. We have a lot more to say about this at our Investor Day. On slide 9, we show Net Interest Income, deposits, and loans. In the fourth quarter, Net Interest Income increased by approximately $130 million on a sequential basis driven by North America Consumer. Sequentially, net interest margin remained relatively stable. On a year-over-year basis, Net Interest Income was flat. Also on a year-overyear basis, average deposits grew in the quarter as we continued to deepen relationships with our institutional clients as well as our consumer clients, particularly in North America. Average loans were roughly flat year-overyear as growth in the ICG was offset by a decline in GCB. As the probability of higher rates has increased over the last few quarters, let me make a few comments regarding the potential impact from higher rates. In our 10-Q, we disclosed interest rate sensitivity assuming a parallel shift and a run-off balance sheet. This is different from our peers methodology which tends to assume a static balance sheet. Assuming a static balance sheet and a 100-basis point parallel shift, we would expect Citi's total Net Interest Income across all currencies to increase by over three times more than what was disclosed in our third quarter 10-Q, or roughly $2.5 billion to $3 billion of Net Interest Income. On slide 10, we show our summary balance sheet and key capital and liquidity metrics. We maintain a very strong balance sheet. Of our $2.3 trillion balance sheet, about 25% or $530 billion consistent of HQLA, and we maintain total liquidity resources of approximately $960 billion, and we continued to optimize our balance sheet deploying excess liquidity into securities as we took advantage of opportunities in the market, as well as reducing our shortterm and long-term debt sequentially and year-over-year. On the loan side, corporate loans represent approximately 60% of total loans, with loans to corporates outside of the US representing approximately 30% of total loans. And as we've mentioned in the past, about 80% of our total corporate loans are investment grade. As we look into the remainder of the year, there are a number of variables with respect to capital. These include regulatory headwinds that are impacting us along with the rest of the industry such as elevated GSIB surcharges, as well as the timing and impact from the divestitures of the 13 Asia exits and Mexico. In light of this, you should expect us to manage to a CET1 ratio closer to 12% by the end of the year due to the expected GSIB surcharge increase at the beginning of 2023. That said, we remain focused on all aspects of capital with the goal of maintaining a CET1 ratio of 11.5%. And as you know, under the SEB framework, we can assess on a quarter-by-quarter basis the right level of buybacks and we will continue to do so throughout the year with a goal of returning excess capital to shareholders. On slide 11, we show the results for our Institutional Clients Group for the fourth quarter. Revenues increased 4% year-over-year driven by Investment Banking, Private Bank, and Security Services fees, partially offset by a decline in markets. Expenses increased 10% year-over-year driven by transformation, business-led investments, and revenue-related expenses partially offset by productivity savings. Cost of credit was a net benefit of approximately $300 million as net credit losses were more than offset by an ACL release. And we continue to see strong credit performance with net credit losses declining on a year-overyear basis and nonaccrual loans down sequentially and year-over-year. This resulted in net income of $2.5 billion, down approximately 22% from the prior year largely driven by the higher expenses and a smaller ACL release versus the prior year. And ICG delivered a 10.8% RoTCE for the quarter. We also saw 5% growth in both loans and deposits on a year-over-year basis as we continue to see good momentum and deepening of existing client relationships and new client acquisitions. As for the full year, ICG delivered approximately $16 billion of net income on $44 billion of revenue with an RoTCE of roughly 17%. On slide 12, we show revenue performance by business and key drivers for our ICG business for the fourth quarter. Treasury and Trade Solution revenues were slightly down versus the prior year driven by continued headwinds from rates offset by 18% growth in fees. In fact, our highest fee quarter ever, and revenue did increase sequentially driven by both Net Interest Income and strong fee growth. We continue to see strong underlying drivers in TTS on a year-over-year basis that indicate continued strong client activity. Since this is the first time we're showing key metrics that demonstrate this momentum, I want to briefly walk you through each one and what it represents. US dollar clearing transactions are up 4% which reflect the clearing and settlement activity of commercial and treasury flows for financial institutions. Cross-border flows were up 15%. These flows represent our global payment flows where we provide cross-border solutions for our clients that are fully integrated across our TTS and Markets business in over 145 currencies, and importantly, this client activity drives recurring fee revenues and generates significant operating deposits. Commercial Card volumes, which reflect travel, purchase, and virtual card activity across all clients are up 48%. Again, these metrics are indicators of client activity and fees, and on a combined basis drive approximately 50% of total TTS fee revenue. Investment Banking revenues are up 43% year-over-year driven by growth across products including record advisory performance, the best advisory quarter we've had in over a decade. Private Bank revenues were up 6% year-over-year as we continue to see strong momentum in new client acquisitions. Overall markets revenues were down 17% versus last year, and while there were different dynamics that played through Fixed Income and Equity Markets performance, the performance is against a very strong quarter last year. Fixed Income Markets revenues were down 20% year-over-year. While we had solid growth in FX and commodities, this was more than offset by a decline in rates and spread products. Equity Markets revenues were down 3% year-over-year as continued growth in prime finance balances and structured activities was offset by a decline in cash. Security Services revenues grew 5% year-over-year as fees grew 11% driven by higher settlement volumes and higher assets under custody partially offset by interest rate headwinds. Now turning to slide 13, here we show the results for our Global Consumer Banking business for the fourth quarter in constant dollars. Revenues declined 6% year-over-year driven by lower revenues across regions. Expenses were up 34% year-over-year driven by the Asia divestiture cost. Excluding these costs, expenses were up 9% driven by transformation and business-led investments partially offset by productivity savings. Cost of credit was a $105 million benefit this quarter as an ACL release more than offset net credit losses. The NCL rate for the quarter was 1.2%, a decline of 61 basis points year-over-year and 20 basis points sequentially. We released over $900 million of ACL this quarter related to continued improvement in our economic outlook and portfolio quality, partially offset by volume growth. This resulted in a net income decline of 42% and an RoTCE of 8%. Excluding the Asia divestitures impact, net income would have grown 44% and resulted in an RoTCE of 20%. As for the full year, GCB delivered $6 billion of net income on $27 billion of revenues with an RoTCE of 17%, and 22% excluding Asia divestiture impacts. On slide 14, we show GCB revenues by product as well as key business drivers and metrics for the fourth quarter. Branded Cards revenues declined 3% year-over-year on higher payment rates and portfolio mix. We're seeing encouraging underlying drivers with new accounts up 43%, card sales volumes up 24%, and average loans up 3%. In fact, the fourth quarter acquisitions exceeded the same quarter in 2019 by 2%, the first quarter to do so since the onset of the pandemic. Retail Services revenues declined 10% year-over-year driven by a 2% decline in Net Interest Income due to elevated payment rates as well as by higher partner payments driven by improved credit performance. But despite this, we are seeing positive underlying drivers with account acquisitions up 6% and spend up 16% on a year-over-year basis. While we're encouraged by these underlying drivers in both cards businesses, payment rates do remain stubbornly high, impacting our loan growth and revenue growth in both cards businesses. Retail Banking revenues declined 6% year-over-year driven by lower deposit spreads as well as lower mortgage revenue. However, underlying drivers remain strong with deposits up 13%, Citigold household up 9%, and assets under management up 8% year-over-year as we continued to execute on our North America retail strategy with a focus on our Global Wealth unit. Asia revenues declined 7% year-over-year largely driven by rate headwinds and higher payment rates. Performance in the wealth hubs exceeded that of the overall region with deposit growth of 12%, AUM growth of 13%, and 16% growth in Citigold and CPC clients. Latin America revenues declined 3% year-over-year mainly due to lower loan volumes in both retail and cards. On slide 15, we show results for Corporate/Other for the fourth quarter. Revenues increased year-over year largely driven by higher net revenue from the investment portfolio. Expenses are down year-over-year largely due to the wind-down of legacy assets. Cost of credit was benign. As part of our strategy refresh, our goal is to be as simple and transparent as possible, and I hope you like the new earnings presentation and we will continue to evolve it going forward. And with that, Jane and I would be happy to take your questions.","billion, , revenue, cet1, net income, liquidity, million, loan growth, trillion, net interest income",yes,Yes,cet1,No,,No,,No,,Yes,gsib,Yes,fdic,No,,Yes,"cet1 ratio, net interest margin"
2021,Q4,"Question And Answer
Operator",Your first question is from the line of John McDonald with Autonomous Research.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,John Mcdonald,"Good morning. Mark, thanks for all the detail there, and Jane for the strategic update. Mark, I wanted to ask if you could just go over the restatement of the Net Interest Income sensitivity. Just want to make sure we caught that. What's the difference that's driving the new presentation there, and just what are the key drivers for your Net Interest Income outlook this year? You don't have to give a number, but kind of when you think about trading. And then core NII and card growth, maybe some of the thoughts there. Thanks.",net interest income,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Mark Mason,"Sure. Thank you, and good morning, John. So on slide 9 is where I kind of covered that. You'll recall, John, that historically, we have looked in our disclosure at a run-off balance sheet, and that obviously has deposits running off as they term out. It has loans running off as they mature. Others take an approach where they look at a static balance sheet, and so we've run the analysis around assuming a static balance sheet and assuming 100 basis point parallel shift in a rising rate environment, obviously across all currencies. We obviously have a mix of US dollar and foreign currencies as well. And when we run that analysis now assuming the balance sheet is static, that is the deposit levels, loan levels, et cetera, that delivers three times more than what we disclosed in the Q in the third quarter. So that's the $2.5 billion to $3 billion of Net Interest Income. So obviously retaining or assuming that the deposit levels stay the same allow us to generate more Net Interest Income, and that's a major driver in the number range or the range that I provided. In terms of the forward look, I'm not going to give you guidance as you mentioned, but I think there are a couple things that are important to keep in mind that we're looking at for 2022. One is the drivers that we mentioned earlier. So a lot of the underlying drivers in our franchise look very strong and are driving healthy fee revenue growth, and I would expect with an outlook for positive GDP that that's going to continue to play to our advantage in 2022. The second thing I'd point out is the assumptions around interest rate hikes in 2022. As many as three or four, depending on the economist view that you listen to, and that obviously is going to play to our favor as well when you think about the number of accrual businesses that we have whether it's our TTS franchise or our Private Bank, et cetera, et cetera. So those are important factors that impact the top line and that we expect to help contribute to some growth coming out of 2022. I mentioned the loan growth on the Branded Cards portfolio. For cards, it's really going to be about payment rates and how they taper off, hopefully taper off. They've been stubbornly high through all of 2021, so hopefully we start to see some of that taper off and we get a little bit of growth in average interest-earning balances in the back half of the year, but those are important factors that need to play through into 2022.","billion, loan growth, revenue, net interest income",yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,John Mcdonald,"Okay. Great. And then just as a follow-up, as you're managing capital, you mentioned you'll return to some level of buybacks this quarter. And you've got a lot of capital that you expect to free up in transactions that haven't happened yet, so I guess how are you kind of thinking about that future capital as something that you'll deploy as you get it as part of your long-term thinking but you're not planning on using that throughout this year, I assume?",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Mark Mason,"Yeah, so obviously, we look at capital planning with a, in the context of our strategy and our ability to actually deploy that capital, but to return as much excess capital as we can to our shareholders. And so as we think about the divestitures which are underway as that capital frees up, we're going to factor that into the capital plan for the year and the quarter and where we can, we're going to return that to shareholders. So a number of deals are scheduled to close in 2022. That will be part of our plan, and we'll be looking forward to taking those actions in the outer part of the year.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Operator,Your next question is from the line of Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Mike Mayo,"Thank you for the new presentation. But the biggest question that I and I think many investors have is, when all is said and done, who is Citigroup? What's the most simple statement you can give on who and what Citigroup represents?",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Jane Fraser,"Oh, I love that question. So I would say that our vision for Citi is to be the preeminent bank for institutions with cross-border needs. We'll be a leader in – global leader in wealth, a major player in consumer payments and lending in the home market, and that is Citi and our vision for it. It's a simpler firm, more focused, it's much better connected, it's certainly simpler to operate, characterized by a culture of excellence and accountability, and I think as I hope we've shown today one that should be easier for everybody to understand and fully aligned with our shareholders' interests.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Mike Mayo,"And along those lines, you're freeing up, what, about $11 billion of capital now, and intentions, Mark, I always hear you say you're going to invest in the business, you're going to do supply for growth and then you're going to buy back stock, but in terms of a stock price that's this low, I mean, the stock price relative to the financial index is one of the all-time lows. Wouldn't you move buybacks up in the priority order? Or what else can you do or say to show that shareholders matter? Jane, I mean, you've done so much on the E side. You've certainly done a lot on the S side, but the G in ESG when it relates to shareholders, shareholders have been left back for so long, just seeing what else you might be able to do or say as it relates to recognizing shareholders and their desire to have a stock price that does better.",billion,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Jane Fraser,"Our shareholders are an enormous priority for us, and, Mike, I know we need to make the bank for shareholderaligned and friendly, and we are doing so. So let me give you four examples. Our strategy will generate, and we will return excess capital to shareholders, and as you say, given where the stock is trading, it makes buybacks highly attractive. Second, we're taking the structural and strategic decisions to put the bank in the best position to drive shareholder value, and you can see, we're executing, and we are delivering with urgency and we're very driven to get the valuation in a far higher place than it is today. Third, we're changing many elements of the financial reporting so it's easier for our shareholders to understand the bank and we're going to be as transparent as possible so you can measure our progress and results, and I think the structure that Mark laid out and I gave the high-level on will make that job much easier. And then finally, and a topic I know you've been quite vocal around, we are also making changes to compensation. So more of our senior business leaders will be on the PSUs for this coming year. We've moved to 100% deferred stock versus a mix of stock and cash in the geographies that we're permitted to do so, and we're increasing the importance of returns in determining performance evaluations. There is a myriad of paths and lots of different actions that we're taking because our shareholders matter to us, and we want to get our valuation up to one that we think realizes its full potential.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Operator,Your next question is from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley..,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Betsy Graseck,"Hi. Okay. So a couple of questions. One, just thinking through the walk from where you are today in CET1 till the end of the year when you mentioned you'd be ending the year at 12%, you have some businesses that are exiting, which should reduce RWAs I would think, but then you've got debt buybacks as well coming through, and at the same time, I would expect that you'd probably want to grow your RWAs. I know your RWAs were down 5% Q2 and maybe that was a part of the reason why FICC was a little light, so could you help me understand just how we should think about that trajectory and the drivers of that CET1 change because it will have some impact on how we're thinking about the rev growth in the Markets business.",cet1,no,Yes,cet1,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Mark Mason,"Yeah, good question. So we are looking at, obviously, how we continue to invest in the franchise, particularly where there are areas of growth. At the same time, ensure that we're delivering buybacks for return to shareholders. As I look at the CET1 ratio, we're ending the year at about 12.2%. As you know, SACR kicks in or has kicked in on January 1. We're ending, therefore, on January 1 at roughly around where our target is, and over the course of the year, we'll be able to absorb growth in the businesses where there's a need to do that while continuing to identify offsets to both SA-CCR, but also low-returning assets that we may have and ridding ourselves of those and generating income as well as the capital from the divestitures that we will be able to close throughout the course of the year. And so as we look at that plan, the start of the year, which is close to our target, towards the end of 2022, we will have to build that back up to about 12% in order to absorb the GSIB headwind assuming there's no relief provided to that, which then kicks in at the beginning of 2023. And so through the course of the year, we'll utilize through RWA, we'll free up capital and return capital to shareholders, we'll generate more earnings, but at the end of the year we'll need to kind of end on the higher end or towards that 12%.",cet1,yes,Yes,cet1,No,,No,,No,,Yes,gsib,No,,No,,Yes,cet1 ratio
2021,Q4,Betsy Graseck,"Do you have a sense as to how much the benefit to like GSIB or SCB should be from all the divestitures you're doing? I was actually thinking when I saw the Mexico news this week that maybe that was one of the reasons why you decided to exit the Mexico consumer businesses as potentially the pickup that you'd get since you mentioned, it makes you a simpler company and that should feed into SCB, I would think.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,Yes,gsib,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Mark Mason,"Yeah, it's not a major driver as to the decision, as Jane has kind of framed out, but it does factor into the points that you've raised. So from a GSIB point of view, there's, I don't know, $31 billion or so of deposits that are tied to our Mexico consumer business. That would drive about 10 basis points or so, or 10 points I should say on the GSIB score. The total for the divestitures that we've earmarked, it's about $85 billion in deposits, and so you can do the math that we'd get some benefit from that. You're right and we – I don't have numbers that I would share at this point in part because the fed has to run their analysis, but you're right from a CCAR point of view when you think about the stress capital buffer there's an impact to PPNR, but more importantly to stress losses that will play through as well. As you know that impact as well as the deposit impact won't really come into play until we've closed on these transactions, but it certainly is a factor to how we think about the longer-term capital planning, and it certainly is something that I'm going to talk more about at Investor Day on March 2.",billion,yes,No,,No,,No,,Yes,ccar,Yes,gsib,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Betsy Graseck,"Okay. Thanks. And the low-returning assets that you were talking about exiting, is that like – that's basically something like rates in the Fixed Income business and should we expect some impact there, or again, I'm just trying to tie together the 5% decline in RWAs and the comment that Fixed Income business was a little light this quarter.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Mark Mason,"Yeah. I'm not looking to be specific on where the low-returning assets we're getting out, but we're certainly looking at our markets franchise to see where those low-returning assets exist as well as to see where their client relationships that are single product and don't necessarily link across the franchise, and so this is something that Jane and I, along with Paco are keenly focused on. We realize that while we've seen growth in markets and in FICC, it has come with growth in the balance sheet, and we want to make sure that we're optimizing the use of the capital.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Operator,Your next question is from the line of Erika Najarian with UBS.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Erika Najarian,"Yes, hi. Good morning. My first question is for Mark, please, and by the way, thank you so much for this new way of disclosing financials. I think this will be very helpful, and the NII sensitivity as well.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Mark Mason,"Yeah. Great question. You know, I'm not going to give guidance on 2022, but let me try and frame out how we're thinking about it, because I think it is important. Both Jane and I recognize that we've got – there's a lot of static we're getting. Excuse me. So in terms of the expenses, we obviously have a large expense base. We've seen growth play out this year, but I think there's some real opportunities over time to attack the expense base and that's exactly what we intend to do. So if you think about the divestitures, I'll start there for a second. There's some $6.8 billion of expenses tied to divestitures. As those divestitures get closed out, some of that will naturally go away. The balance of that, which tends to be referred to as stranded costs, we're already putting in place a team to focus on attacking and driving out that stranded costs. The second point that I'll bring up around this is the transformation. The transformation has driven 3 percentage points of growth this year. I do expect that there's more growth associated with that, particularly since we're still doing more hiring. There's more tech spend that will be required. But the transformation over time will deliver efficiencies, will reduce the manual touchpoints, will drive straight through processing, and therefore, will allow for us to bring our expenses down. And the final piece that I'll mention is the strategy, and so Jane mentioned in our strategy a focus on core businesses, and that's going to allow for us to look at the organizational structure and identify more simplification opportunities in the way we manage and run the firm. We do about $300 million to $400 million of productivity savings a quarter. That's not enough. We think there's more opportunity for efficiencies than that, and it's those opportunities that we're going to chase down in order to fund some of this investment spend that we expect in the next couple of years. More on that at Investor Day.","billion, million",yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Erika Najarian,"Thank you for framing that. Jane, this next question is for you. When you responded to Mike's question about your vision of Citi, you led with your vision of Citi as the world's corporate bank, if I could rephrase. How is your vision of Citi, what does it include in terms of your funding base? There's a lot of conversation particularly in the beginning of a rising rate environment about the natural gap that you have to your largest US peers with regards to your naturally higher rate deposits, right? And so how do you envision your funding base evolving over time, and do you have any interest in significantly building out your US retail deposit franchise?",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Jane Fraser,"So, Erika, we've got a pretty diverse funding base. When we look at it from the Institutional side, we've got the number-one TTS franchise globally and that has material funding from our cash management and dominant position in cash management there. Our wealth franchise both from the ultra high net worth down to the affluent clients is also a source of material and very attractive deposits and funding for us. Obviously, we're making the exits on the international consumer banking front, and we've been focused in the retail bank in the US in driving digital deposit growth and continuing to make sure that that business generates a stable, low-cost funding for the firm here in the US and we'll expect to continue growing that going forward.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Operator,Your next question is from the line of Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Mike Mayo,"Hi. That was sooner than I expected. Just to follow-up on the compensation changes, yes, that's good news that people are paid in stock instead of just cash and stock, but you had the new bonus arrangement. I did not think that was finalized, but as part of the new bonus arrangement based on the next three-year financial targets, is that still all cash, or is that cash and stock, or is that stock?",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Jane Fraser,"I'm assuming you're referring to the transformation award. Is that correct, Mike?",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Mike Mayo,Yes.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Jane Fraser,"Yeah, so that one, while it's paid in cash for the first two pieces, the last 50% is pegged to our three-year stock performance and we felt that that was the appropriate balance here. As we said, transformation is our highest priority. We need to successfully address the concerns raised and that's 100% in our shareholders' interest. One of the pieces that's important in that is that we need to have collective accountability to succeed in addressing these concerns, it's a shift in our culture, and this award is one that is therefore dependent upon shared success versus individual incentives here. So it's an important part of delivering, and of course if we fail to deliver the outcomes of the transformation and are not successful in the execution, there will be no award.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Mike Mayo,"And when will we find – I guess we'll find out about those targets at Investor Day, so answering that question. As it relates to PSUs, how much was given in cash before and how many people will this apply to versus where it was before?",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Jane Fraser,"The PSUs are given to the executive management team and now we're extending that to the broader operating team which includes the leaders of our major businesses, and you'll see that information delivered in the proxy when we issue that in March. So you'll get all of that information at roughly the same time.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Operator,Your next question is from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Ken Usdin,"Hi. Thanks a lot. Good morning. Mark, I was wondering if you could just talk a little bit about the card business in aggregate. Definitely starting to see a little bit of that balance, but I wonder if you could touch on, number one, like just how you're expecting that balance trajectory to go. Number two, spend versus lend and how much you're seeing in that, and then, three, just the losses are obviously just amazingly low and how would you anticipate card normalization. Thanks.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Mark Mason,"Yeah, sure. So as I've mentioned before, I mean, when you look at what's going on with cards, across the board we are seeing increases in spend volume. So Branded Cards spend volume is up 24%. Retail Services spend volumes up 16%, so very healthy spend volume. People are using our cards, which is a good thing. In terms of the liquidity that's still out there in the market, even though savings rates have started to normalize there's still a significant amount of liquidity that's out there in the market, and that's showing up in payment rates in both Branded Cards and Retail Services and frankly in some of the international card businesses as well. And that has not subsided, and so we did start to see growth in Branded Cards loans, average loans are up 3% Branded Cards, the end-of-period loans were up 5%. What matters a lot when you come out of a crisis like this is how you reinvest, and so we've spent a lot of time focused on targeting new customers and driving new account acquisitions. Our new account acquisitions are up 43% in Branded Cards, and we've been also driving that just generally across the board in Retail Services as well. So getting a very good response in terms of new accounts coming onboard. We've also been focused on how we drive installment lending activity, just kind of to broaden the lending that we're doing with this customer base, and we've seen significant growth in our Flex Loan, Flex Pay products as we've targeted customers who have historically been transactors to really move them on to that product. So very good growth there. In fact in 2021, we've not only gotten the growth just in aggregate but if I look at kind of installment lending, we've gotten 90% of the total installment sales are in digital sales, which is another kind of low-cost acquisition approach that we've taken. So good underlying indicators there, but again, it's not until payment rates start to subside. We would expect, hope, that that would start to show up towards the back half of 2022. In terms of the losses which was the other part of your question, very low loss levels. You heard me mention the delinquency rates earlier. When I look at the loss rates earlier, when I look at delinquency trend there's really nothing to focus on there. They remain quite low, and we don't see any signs or any areas of concern, I would say, but I would imagine those two would start to normalize as payment rates start to come down.",liquidity,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Ken Usdin,"Great. Mark, thanks. And then just a follow-up, you mentioned the strongest quarter in advisory in a while. I was just wondering if you could just comment broadly on Investment Banking pipelines across the product groups. Thanks a lot.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Mark Mason,"Yeah, the Investment Banking pipeline looks very strong. We ended the year with significant growth in advisory up 146% year-over-year, well above the wallet. We've grown share there. ECM was up about 16%, again above the wallet and really, that reflecting some of the fees coming from SPAC activity, so very good growth. EMEA and North America are both up year-over-year due to continued momentum in M&A, so we feel very good about it. We think the pipeline still looks very strong. We think the investments that we've made in bringing on bankers in some of the sectors we needed to beef up, sectors such as healthcare, technology, sponsors group, those investments are certainly starting to pay off, so we feel good about it.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Operator,Your next question is from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Glenn Schorr,"Yeah. All righty. All righty. So, I think we have a good long-term process in motion and measured in more than one year, but what do you think of the sort of – it feels like returns have to go down before they go up. I know you have the overall goal to close the gap to peers, but between the capital that gets freed up, the GSIB buffer in the denominator, the capital markets partially normalizing some stranded expenses on sold franchises and then continuing to execute on the transformations, is it okay and is it normal, I think it's partially in our models that we go down first and then rise up?",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,Yes,gsib,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Mark Mason,"Yeah, so thank you, Glenn. So look, if you look at 2021 with a 13.4% RoTCE and reserve releases that get close to $9 billion, I'd have to say yes, right? Because those reserve releases drive a considerable amount of that. Now, it's important to compare that to 2020 where we had the opposite effect because we were building meaningful reserves, but as we look at the forward look, which we'll take you through in more detail, as Jane mentioned, we're focused on core parts of the franchise that show the opportunity for growth and the promise for higher returns, and that's where our energies are going to be focused and we think that's what's going to help to drive improved returns over time.",billion,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Glenn Schorr,"Fair enough. The reserve releases have a big impact. Okay. And then in terms of that growth, I think a couple of questions dance around this, so you could be short, but given your answer to what Citi is and wants to be in terms of premier franchise in all those industries, or business lines, I should say, how do you balance that you're doing what's right for stockholders in the near-term, drive stock return versus making sure you invest for the future, because each one of those is super competitive, each one of them has competitors as early as today, or as recent as today spending a ton of money to compete in those spaces, how do you balance that, invest for the long-term would be great versus improve the stock short term?",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Mark Mason,"Yeah. So let me start, and then Jane feel free to add in if you'd like. So the first thing I think it's important to remember is the focus that we're trying to put on these core franchises that drive returns over time. So we're prioritizing how we're going to allocate our resources and our investments in part through the divestiture activity. The second thing I'd say is that we are investing in the franchise for the long-term, right, as opposed to trying to hit some short-term metric, and so that does involve us putting that money to work where there is client demand and where it leverages the competitive advantages that we have developed. And so that is the way we approach this with again an eye towards ensuring that we're clear and transparent with our investors and that if there's excess that we're returning that to our shareholders so they're not just sitting on the sidelines and not generating returns that they would expect of us.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Jane Fraser,"Right. I'd also just jump in when you look at the different businesses that we are investing in, as Mark said, they're high-returning ones. So our Services businesses are much capital lighter, high return. Wealth Management, the same, and I think the opportunities that we've been seeing to continually increase share in Investment Banking, another high-returning business. So that will certainly be helping us over time on that mix that you're talking about. And not everything needs an enormous investment. If I look at wealth, for example, you put the different pieces together that we've already got and we're putting them into a single integrated business and proposition, it's not things that we're starting from scratch, so a lot of this is incremental.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Operator,"Ladies and gentlemen, please limit your questions to one question and one follow-up. Your next question is from the line of Vivek Juneja with JPMorgan.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Vivek Juneja,"Hello, Jane and Mark. A quick one firstly. Now that you're exiting Mexico, Singapore and Hong Kong were not part of the exits when you announced the exit from the 13 markets in the consumer business. Are you going to stay on with the consumer business in those markets, or meaning a traditional consumer business as you've had for years, or is that going to change?",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Jane Fraser,"No, we find that the franchises we have in Singapore and Hong Kong just given the nature of them are really naturally tied to the wealth franchise that we are building and investing in there of our existing very strong platform, as you say. So we expect to continue to provide the range of different services and capabilities that we have because they are so complementary and help support our wealth business in two of the most major wealth hubs in the world.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Vivek Juneja,"Okay. Great. And a follow-up question, if I may have. The NII change, Mark, that you made, what deposit beta are you assuming there? And how much of the change is coming from US net interest income versus the rest of the currencies?",net interest income,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Mark Mason,"Yeah, so we haven't shared our deposit betas, but as you would imagine, the betas tend to be higher on the institutional side than on the retail side. And so that's that piece. And I'm sorry, the second part of your question was what? Vivek?",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Vivek Juneja,"Okay. The second part was how much of the change in net interest income from the interest rate sensitivity change, Mark that you're making...how much is the US net interest income versus the rest of the currencies?",net interest income,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Mark Mason,"The increase is roughly skewed towards the international, so I'd say of a $3 billion increase, I'd say about two-thirds/one-third international.",billion,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Vivek Juneja,That's where you were assuming more of the balance sheet run-off?,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Mark Mason,Yes.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Operator,Your next question is from the line of Charles Peabody with Portales.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Charles Peabody,"Yeah. A question regarding the regulatory and political risk to share buybacks, and I ask that because earlier this week in the Powell renomination hearings, when you listen to the last two minutes of that testimony, Sherrod Brown went on a rail against buybacks in the banking industry. And then last year I think President Biden had two speeches in which he spoke out against buybacks. So I'm trying to understand, is there – I mean, a transaction tax isn't going to stop you guys from doing buybacks, but are there other things being discussed out there other than just moral suasion to discourage buybacks?",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Jane Fraser,"Yeah. We're going to do the right thing for our shareholders, and right now, particularly given where the stock's trading, buybacks are a very, very important and probably top of the stack for us action that we take, so no, we're very clear in terms of the importance of giving our shareholders back our excess capital.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Charles Peabody,"No, I understand that you want to. I'm just trying to understand what the risk to your desires are from the regulatory or political side.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Jane Fraser,"I don't believe there is one. We're extremely well-capitalized. I think we've heard it consistently from Washington. The confidence in the capitalization of the banks both coming into and coming out of the pandemic, and we're not overly concerned on that front.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Mark Mason,"We'll obviously adhere to regulatory guidelines as they exist or however they evolve, but that's exactly right.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Charles Peabody,"All right. And then as a follow-up just on that subject, assuming these regulators – just getting into their seats, they're probably not going to be able to do anything this year on buybacks, but I'm assuming that they'll try and do something on buybacks next year. So you want to do as much buyback short-term as you can and you've talked about getting back to like a $3 billion pace here in the first quarter. How sustainable is that $3 billion pace?",billion,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Mark Mason,"Yeah. So look, I mean, first of all with the SCB framework, we take decisions on the capital actions on a quarterby- quarter basis. Obviously, there's another CCAR run that we'll all go through that will determine at least part of the capital stack, and then obviously, there's the GSIB that's coming into play. So we factor all of those things in. In our case, as we develop the capital plan, we also will take a look at the divestitures and in some instances the divestitures will generate TCE for us to return to shareholders. There may be other impacts from divestitures that are temporary in nature that need to be factored in, but it's part of an entire annual capital planning process that we go through that factors all of those things in.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,Yes,ccar,Yes,gsib,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Operator,Your next question is from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Gerard Cassidy,"Can you guys share with us, when you think about the strategy refresh that is underway, are we 75% complete, 80% complete? Mark, you alluded to maybe some of the Markets businesses that may not have the returns you want, there could be some area, but were you there, and by the Investor Day, can we assume that it will be completed?",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Jane Fraser,"In terms of the timeline to this one, this particular exercise is drawing to a close in terms of what I call the big step back as a new CEO. So we said this is the last major structural decision that we're taking in Mexico. We're now focused on pulling together everything from Investor Day and that's where the new reporting structure, I think, that we've announced today is also a very important foundation for that. So I'm confident that we've made the right big structural decisions and that we're looking forward to Investor Day laying out the vision, the strategies, and the plan for going forward.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Mark Mason,"Yeah. And let me be clear, Gerard, just in case I wasn't. I'm not suggesting we're exiting parts of our Markets business. That is not what I'm suggesting at all. What I am suggesting is that as we would always do, we're constantly looking for opportunities to optimize the way we use our balance sheet, capital, RWA, et cetera, and where we identify the need to rid ourselves of low-returning assets that we have, we do that, all right. And so with rule changes like SA-CCR and the like, either pricing will adjust or we'll have to take a hard look at some of those assets to see if it still makes sense, and that's more of what I meant than ever suggesting we were exiting part of the Markets business.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Gerard Cassidy,"And just as a quick follow-up, obviously some of the businesses you're committed to, TTS, the investment banking area, you guys clearly are players there, you have economies of scale. When you look at the other businesses that you're committed to stay in, where is the heavy lifting going to come from where you really got to step it up to get those economies of scale, similar to the ones that are quite obvious.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Jane Fraser,"Yeah, you're right. We have a number of businesses that are already extremely scaled in both markets. If we look at TTS, we are moving $4 trillion of volume daily there, so those are ones where the investments are much more around digitization, around data. And in terms of where are we looking at getting more to – of increasing our scale, commercial bank is obviously one where we have a commercial banking presence in 30 different markets around the world and they're very focused on the same target market I talked about in the vision, which are those mid-market companies with global needs or multi-market needs. And then the other areas in terms of wealth where we've already begun, as you can see from our earlier remarks building out our frontline scale on the back of the platforms and other investments that we're making.",trillion,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Mark Mason,"And to your point, Jane, commercial bank this year, huge opportunity to leverage more of the TTS offering that we have. We're already seeing diversification in the commercial bank in terms of CMO and other markets products, and the revenue this year was up 12% year-over-year. And similar strength in acquisition of new clients in wealth, but those are two key areas, I agree.",revenue,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Operator,Your next question is from the line of Ebrahim Poonawala with Bank of America.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Ebrahim Poonawala,"Good afternoon. Just quick couple of follow-ups. Mark, on the capital return, I just wanted to make sure. When we think about the $3 billion pace you're going to get back to in 1Q, moving forward, is there more upside risk with that $3 billion, or could that be actually lower? I just want to make sure we have that right in terms of expectations.",billion,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Mark Mason,"Yeah. I'm not giving expectations for the quarter-by-quarter capital buyback decisions, in part because as I mentioned, with the new SCB rule, we're able to look at it on a quarterly basis, so I'm not giving guidance beyond that. We'll talk more about the capital plan on March 2 broadly, right?",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Ebrahim Poonawala,"And just I guess going back, Jane, on US retail, I think the question is, is there something more meaningful that we should expect at the Investor Day? And it's fine if you want to hold it till then, because if I recall correctly, you were a partner with Google, that didn't play out. The big question that investors have is, is there a better definition to the US retail franchise. And I'm just wondering will we get that at March Investor Day, or there's nothing radical that you have in store at least in the near-term as far as US retail is concerned.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Jane Fraser,"You'll be certainly hearing directly from Anand who is responsible for that business on Investor Day and he'll lay out all of our US Personal Banking strategy of what we're looking at both from our top two cards franchise and our plan – what we're doing in Personal Lending as well as what we're doing in wealth and then obviously the retail bank and the supporting role it is playing for those two core drivers of growth for us in the States. So, yes.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Operator,Your next question is from the line of Jim Mitchell with Seaport Research.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Jim Mitchell,"Hey, good afternoon. Mark, maybe on just the expenses, I appreciate all of the moving parts with the divestitures and you're not going to give us the full year expense guidance number, but can you help on the jumping-off point at the first quarter? We had compensation was up about $1 billion quarter over-quarter. How much of that was just sort of the comp changes, or is that a good run rate to think about, so if you could just help us just the jumping-off point for first quarter would be helpful.",billion,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Mark Mason,"Yeah, you know what, I'm not going to be able to give you kind of more guidance on that. I mean, what I would say is, again, you got a couple things that played through 2021 that will be important factors in 2022. One, the hiring that we've done we're going to get a full year impact of that, at least for part of that in 2022, so that's going to play out. Some of the – if you think about the mix for the transformation spend, which is a mix of both hires, third-party spend, as well as technology, that mix will start to shift over time away from third-party for sure and towards the others, and so we're going to have some of that dynamic start to play out in 2022. In terms of the comp specifically in the fourth quarter, we obviously tie the comp performance for the full year is tied to revenues, and so as we would expect to see some forward growth based on the drivers, I mentioned earlier, we would expect to see comp related to that play out over the course of 2022. But I'd rather not get into the specifics here given that we're going to give you a better sense for it in early March.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Jim Mitchell,"Okay. Just maybe as a follow-up on that, just so I understand the sequential drivers, so you're saying it's mostly incentive comp or was that more new hires, or both? Just from 3Q to 4Q change.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Mark Mason,"Yeah, in 3Q to 4Q, you've got both hires as well as incentive comp.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Operator,Your next question is from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. MATT O’,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Connor,"Hi. I just wanted to follow up, you had said the sale of Mexico wouldn't be an easy transaction and was just hoping you could elaborate on that. And then just related, you talked about the capital that's allocated to the business being freed up, but any kind of initial thoughts on whether the transaction, the exit of the business will generate a gain or loss as we think about the combined or total capital impact. Thank you.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Jane Fraser,"Why don't I kick that off, and Mark jump in. As I said, it won't be a simple transaction because we separate the bank into the Institutional business from the businesses that we're exiting, and that's something that we kicked off yesterday, that process. And then we'll be looking to go to the market in the spring and to be active with buyers, potential buyers in a few months' time. So it's more just the complexity of separating the bank. We've got good plans behind this. And as I said in my remarks, these are terrific, these are scaled, these are great franchises, and there's obviously a lot of speculation in the press which is too early to comment on, but we do think this is a jewel for someone. It's just not for us.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Mark Mason,"Yeah. I agree, and I think it's premature to speculate on structure of the deal and things of that sort. You're right, we do have about $4 billion of TCE allocated to the business. The other layer of complexity is around the CTA, and you've heard us spend some time on that when we talked about the Australia sale and I introduced it as a complexity because there's an accounting treatment associated with the CTA that happens at signing that is separate from the capital implication that happens at closing. So with a CTA, the capital impact flows through AOCI, but it's neutral once the deal is closed, and in Mexico, the consumer business would have a DTA of a little bit less than $3 billion or so, and so that's another factor that's involved with the transaction.",billion,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Jane Fraser,"A CTA, not a DTA.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Mark Mason,Did I say DTA?,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Jane Fraser,Yeah.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Mark Mason,"I’m sorry, CTA. Currency translation adjustment.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Operator,Your next question is from the line of Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Steven Chubak,"Well, actually even before asking my question, I just wanted to echo some of the earlier remarks. The new presentation, the additional detail, it's really helpful, so appreciate the new disclosure.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Mark Mason,Thank you.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Steven Chubak,"Mark, I'm going to ask, well, I guess technically one question, but it's really a three parter. You might need to grab a pen and paper. But I wanted to just unpack some of the comments you made on the NII sensitivity and reporting differences versus peers. You noted there more than three times increase in NII assuming a static balance sheet, but there's still a lot of investors that just question your rate sensitivity profile given the fairly modest NII growth that we saw in the last cycle. And first question, just wanted to start by asking given your heavier institutional deposit gearing, wouldn't it be reasonable for us to expect that your deposit run-off would actually be greater than peers? Two, does the NII guidance contemplate liability sensitivity in the Markets business, and could you help us size that potential drag? And then just lastly, it's more of a catch-all. Any idiosyncratic factors that you could speak to that would support a better NII outcome or higher rate benefit versus what we saw in the last cycle?",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Mark Mason,"Yeah, sure. So look, we provided the sensitivity because we think comparability is important here, and you can see the magnitude of that difference is pretty sizable. There's still going to be a difference between us and peers, but that difference narrows when you put it on a comparable basis. We do have a skew towards institutional clients and they do carry a higher beta associated with them, but we also have a skew towards international currencies and we make good spreads there as well. In terms of the impact through markets, the impact – I think the markets impact can come in any number of ways. I think rate moves and other uncertainty and volatility in the market can drive broader markets revenues which we would potentially see depending on how investors have to reposition their books. In terms of the last part of your question, I don't think there's anything else that I would point to. I mean, obviously with the excess liquidity that we've seen and been carrying in the market, we've been putting that to work in investments. We've increased our investment portfolio by some $70 billion. We expanded the duration to about 2.85 years and we still have significant dry powder to put to work with either client demand or in an increasing rate environment which we expect.","billion, liquidity",yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,

2021,Q4,Operator,Your final question is from the line of Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Mike Mayo,Hey. One more question. What's the hardest part of the culture to change?,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Jane Fraser,"Probably it's been breaking down some of the silos, and that the point on the principles we laid out, Mike, of connected is really a key piece of it. We've rolled out some new leadership principles last year and it's very much around how do we get the firm very well-connected and really realize the full synergies. So breaking some of those old habits, I would say. The new structure is certainly helping us at the different initiatives we're taking.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Mike Mayo,"And how long do you think that will take, because you're breaking down a culture that's been ingrained for quite some time?",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Jane Fraser,"Yeah, I would say I'm really happy with the progress. We've been – one of the first things I did was laid the firm to on our culture out when I took over, and we've got a terrific team of people being working at this for years. So I'm very happy with the progress we make. I think everyone's clear, we want the culture to be one of accountability, of excellence, and acting with urgency, and part of that is well underway. But it'll take a little bit longer.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,

Actual results may differ materially from these statements due to a variety of factors, including those described in our SEC filings. With that, I'll turn it over to Jane.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Jane Fraser,"Thank you, Jenn, and happy new year to everyone joining us today. We are very much off and running as we start 2023. Today, I'll share our perspective on the macro environment before recapping our performance in the fourth quarter. And then I will take a few minutes to reflect on our progress in 2022 and our strategic priorities for the coming year. The global macro environment played out largely as we anticipated during the second half of last year. As we enter 2023, the environment is a tad better than we all expected, for the time being at least, despite the aggressive tightening by central banks. In Europe, a warmer December reduced the stress on energy supplies and inflation is beginning to ease off its peak. That said, we still expect softening of economic conditions across the Eurozone this year given some of the structural challenges it is grappling with. In Asia, while the public health impacts in China are unfortunately likely to be severe, the abrupt end of COVID zero should begin to drive growth and improve sentiment generally. And here at home, the labor market remains strong and holiday spending was better than expected, in part because consumers have been dipping into their savings. The Fed remains resolute in tackling core inflation; however, and therefore we continue to see the U.S. entering into a mild recession in the second half of the year. Now turning to how we performed. For the fourth quarter, we reported net income of $2.5 billion and EPS of $1.16. Our full-year revenue growth of 3% ex-divestitures was in line with the guidance we gave you at Investor Day, as was the case with our expenses. We delivered an RoTCE of nearly 9% and a CET1 ratio of 13%. This quarter, our businesses performed similarly to how they did throughout the year. We are quite pleased with some, and less happy with the performance of others. Services continues to deliver cracking revenue growth; our Markets businesses are navigating the environment very well, and we are seeing good momentum in U.S. Personal Banking. On the flip side, Investment Banking is feeling the pain of a drastically smaller wallet in ‘22 and the environment for Wealth remains a challenging one. Unpacking that a bit, Services delivered another excellent quarter and we have gained significant share in both Treasury and Trade Solutions, and Securities Services. TTS, the business most emblematic of the power of our global network, had revenues up 36% year over year, as we execute on the strategy we laid out at Investor Day. Thanks to strong business drivers, coupled with higher rates, TTS is performing ahead of our expectations. Likewise, Securities Services was up a strong 22%. We ended the year having onboarded $1.2 trillion of new assets under administration and custody. Markets had the best fourth quarter in recent memory, with revenues up 18% from 2021. We had the #1 FICC franchise (1) on the street during the first three quarters of the year and Fixed Income was up 31% in the final quarter. Equities was down, as the mix of client activity again did not play to our strength in derivatives. With the wallet down significantly, our Investment Banking revenues were off by about 60% this quarter. While the pipeline looks more promising and client sentiment is improving, it would be hard to predict precisely when the tide will turn in ‘23. Wealth Management’s performance was disappointing. Revenues were down 6% in the quarter with the macro environment creating headwinds in investment fees and AUM globally, but most acutely in Asia. However, we have been steadily improving the business, as demonstrated by continued momentum in client acquisitions across the spectrum, and net new investment flows. Similarly, we continue to build our client advisor base, albeit at a slower pace given this environment. We would expect to see these investments pay off as the markets recover. In U.S. Personal Banking, both Cards businesses had double-digit revenue growth for the second straight quarter as purchase sales and revolving balances continued to grow strongly. Whilst in Retail Banking, we clearly have some more work to do. As you know, we have been actively managing our balance sheet and risk. Our cost of credit increased in line with our guidance. We built reserves in Personal Banking this quarter on the back of volume growth, as well as, in anticipation of a mild recession. And in the U.S., net credit losses in Cards continue to normalize as we had expected, still well below pre-COVID levels. Corporate credit remains healthy, and our low overall cost of credit was similar to last quarter, reflecting the quality of our corporate loan portfolio. In terms of capital, we increased the CET1 ratio by about 70 basis points to 13% during the fourth quarter. Finally, our tangible book value per share increased to $81.65 and we returned $1 billion to our shareholders through our common dividend. Now let me step back and discuss what we accomplished in 2022. One of our major goals last year was to put in place a strategic plan designed to create long-term value for our shareholders, and to get that plan swiftly off the ground, I am pleased with the significant progress we have already made. We simplified the bank, closing the sales of our consumer businesses in five markets, including three in the fourth quarter, and we have made rapid progress winding down our consumer business in Korea, as well as our franchise in Russia. We continued to invest in our transformation to address our consent orders and to modernize our bank. We are streamlining our processes and making them more automated whilst improving the quality and accessibility of our data; this will make us a better bank. 1 Source: Coalition Greenwich Competitor Analytics for the peer group.

We brought in very strong external talent, met our representation goals, and strengthened our culture by increasing accountability and shareholder alignment. To that end, I am pleased we delivered against our financial guidance for the year. We also released our first plan to reach net zero emissions by 2050, expanded our impact investing, and announced the findings from an external law firm which reviewed our racial equity efforts in the U.S. Finally, I am very proud of how our people handled the macro and geopolitical shocks which defined 2022 and supported our clients and our communities with excellence and compassion throughout. Before I hand over to Mark, let’s turn to the next few years, and in particular the path to achieving our medium term return targets that we laid out on page 5. At Investor Day, we talked about the path coming in three phases with Phase 1 characterized by both disciplined execution and investment. 2023 is a continuation of Phase 1, laying the foundation for driving long-term shareholder value. We are focused on changing our business mix to drive revenues and returns, with the expectation that our businesses will close out ‘23 competitively stronger. Services enters ‘23 with strategic momentum and a pipeline of major new innovations and market leading product capabilities. Markets should continue to benefit from our active corporate client base, with the franchise further advancing on the back of investments and the business’ focus on capital productivity. Banking and Wealth are well positioned for when the cycle turns, thanks to the investments we have made in top talent and technology, as well as synergies realized across the franchise. As you saw, we felt this was the right time to make a change in Wealth and we have started a search to identify the next leader of this business. I asked Jim O’Donnell to take on a new role focused on senior clients across the firm. This will leverage his deep expertise and relationships, and when combined with Sunil Garg’s additional role as North American head, is designed to help us capture more of what is a significant business opportunity in our home market. U.S. Personal Banking will continue to benefit from the recovery in borrowing, taking full advantage of our market-leading digital platforms and new products, particularly in the Cards space. We will make further progress on our International Consumer exits, enabling us to simplify the firm and reduce our cost base. And we will of course focus on our clients – deepening relationships and bringing on new clients in line with our strategy. We will continue making disciplined investments in our franchise including the investments in our Transformation and controls, however, we will pace some of our business investments to reflect the operating environment. Looking further out, we will begin to bend the curve of our expenses to deliver against our medium-term targets through a combination of our divestitures, realizing the financial benefits of our Transformation, and further simplification. And Mark will cover this in more detail shortly. We fully recognize this depresses our returns in the near-term, but we are deliberately taking the tough strategic actions and investments necessary to reach our medium-term return target and to create long-term shareholder value. We are carrying not just our momentum, but our determination into 2023. Despite the macro headwinds, we are very much on track to reach the medium-term return targets we shared with you on Investor Day. We intentionally designed a strategy that can deliver for our shareholders in different environments. We are running the bank differently, with a relentless focus on execution, and will continue to transparently share our proof points with you along the way. With that, I would like to turn it over to Mark and then we would be delighted, as always, to take your questions.","billion, , revenue, net income, trillion, cet1",yes,Yes,cet1,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,Yes,cet1 ratio
2022,Q4,Mark Mason,"Thank you, Jane, and good morning, everyone. We have a lot to cover on today’s call – I am going to start with the fourth quarter and full-year financial results, focusing on year-over-year comparisons, unless I indicate otherwise. I’ll also discuss our progress against our medium-term KPI targets and end with our guidance for 2023. On slide 6, we show financial results for the full firm. In the fourth quarter, we reported net income of approximately $2.5 billion and an EPS of $1.16 and an RoTCE of 5.8% on $18 billion of revenues. Embedded in these results are pre-tax divestiture-related impacts of approximately $192 million, largely driven by gains on divestitures. Excluding these items, EPS was $1.10 with an RoTCE of approximately 5.5%. In the quarter, total revenues increased by 6% or 5%, excluding divestiture-related impacts, as strength across Services, Markets and U.S. Personal Banking was partially offset by declines in Investment Banking, Wealth, and the revenue reduction from the closed exits. Our results include expenses of $13 billion, a decrease of 4% versus the prior year. Excluding divesture related costs from both the fourth quarter of this year and last year, expenses increased by 5%, largely driven by investments in our transformation, business-led investments, and higher volume-related expenses, partially offset by productivity savings and the expense reduction from the exits. Cost of credit was approximately $1.8 billion, primarily driven by the continued normalization in Card net credit losses, particularly in Retail Services, and an ACL build of $645 million, largely related to growth in Cards and some deterioration in macroeconomic assumptions. And on a full-year basis, we delivered $14.8 billion of net income and an RoTCE of 8.9%. Now turning to the full-year revenue walk on slide 7. In 2022, we reported revenue of approximately $75 billion, up 3%, excluding the impact of divestitures, in line with our guidance of low-single-digit growth. Treasury and Trade Solutions revenues were up 32%, driven by continued benefits from Rates, as well as business actions, such as managing deposit repricing, deepening with existing clients and winning new clients across all segments. Client wins have accelerated due to the investments we have been making in market-leading product capabilities. These products include the first 24/7 USD clearing capability in the industry, the 7-day cash sweep product that we launched earlier this year, and Instant Payments which is live in 33 markets, reaching over 60 countries. So, while the rate environment drove about half of the growth this year, business actions and investments drove the remaining half. In Securities Services, revenues grew 15% as net interest income grew 59%, driven by higher interest rates across currencies, partially offset by a 1% decrease in non-interest revenue due to the impact of market valuations. For the full year, we onboarded approximately $1.2 trillion dollars of assets under custody and administration from significant client wins and we continue to feel very good about the pipeline of new deals. In Markets, we grew revenues 7% mainly driven by strength in Rates and FX as we continued to serve our corporate and investor clients while optimizing capital; this was partially offset by the pressures in Equity Markets, primarily reflecting reduced client activity in Equity Derivatives. On the flip side, Banking revenues, excluding gains and losses on loan hedges, were down 39%, driven by Investment Banking, as heightened macro uncertainty and volatility continued to impact client activity. In Cards, we grew revenues 8% as we continued to see benefits from the investments that we made in 2022 along with the rebound in consumer borrowing levels. And in Wealth, revenues were down 2% largely driven by market valuations and China lockdowns; excluding Asia, revenues were up 3%. Corporate / Other also benefitted from higher NII, in part as the shorter duration of our investment portfolio allowed us to benefit from higher short-term rates. And as you can see on the slide, in Legacy Franchises, excluding divestiture-related impacts, revenues decreased about $1.3 billion as we closed five of the exit markets and continued to wind down Russia and Korea Consumer. Going forward, we would expect Legacy Franchises to continue to be an offset to overall revenue growth as we close and wind down the remaining exit markets. On Slide 8, we show an expense walk for the full year with the key underlying drivers. In 2022, excluding divestiture-related impacts, expenses were up roughly 8%, in line with our guidance. Transformation grew 2%, with about two-thirds of the increase related to the risk, controls, data, and finance programs. And approximately 25% of the investments in those programs are related to technology. About 1% of the expense increase was driven by business-led investments, which include improving and adding scalability to our TTS and Securities Services platforms, enhancing client experiences across all businesses, and developing new product capabilities. We also continue to invest in front office talent, albeit at a more measured pace given the environment. And volume-related expenses were up 1%, largely driven by Markets and Cards. The remainder of the growth was driven by structural expenses, which include an increase to risk and control investments to support the front office, as well as macro impacts like inflation. These expenses were partially offset by productivity savings, as well as the benefit from foreign exchange translation and the expense reduction from the exit markets. Across the firm, technology-related expenses increased by 13% this year. On slide 9, we show our 2022 results versus the medium-term KPI targets we laid out at Investor Day, which we will continue to show you as we make progress along the way. Macro factors and market conditions, including those driven by monetary tightening at levels we didn’t anticipate at Investor Day, impacted some KPIs positively and others negatively. However, we were able to offset some of the impacts as we executed against our strategy. In TTS, we continue to see healthy underlying drivers that indicate consistently strong activity from both new and existing clients as we roll out new product offerings and invest in the client experience which is a key part of our strategy. Client wins are up approximately 20%, across all segments, and these again include marquee transactions, where we are serving as the client’s primary operating bank. Through the third quarter YTD, we estimate that we gained about 70 bps of share and maintained our number 1 position with large institutional clients. In addition, we have onboarded over 8,700 suppliers this year, helping our clients manage their supply chains to address the evolving global landscape. And in Securities Services, we onboarded new client assets, which offset some of the decline in market valuations. And we estimate that we have gained about 50 bps of share in Securities Services through the third quarter of this year – including in our home market. In Markets, we strengthened our leadership position in Fixed Income by gaining share while making progress towards our Revenue-to-RWA target. In Cards, loan growth exceeded our expectations in both Branded Cards and Retail Services. Cards spend volumes were up 14%, end-of-period loans up 13%, and most importantly, interest-earning balances up 14%. That said, in areas like Investment Banking, we lost share this year, but maintained our market position. And in Wealth, while we have brought on new advisors and new client assets, given the impact of market valuations, this didn’t translate into growth in client assets or top-line growth at this point. So, in summary, we made good progress against our medium-term KPI targets despite the significant changes in the macroeconomic backdrop since Investor Day. This highlights that our diversified business model is adaptable to many environments, and we have the right strategy to achieve our return targets over the medium-term. Now turning back to the fourth quarter, on slide 10, we show net interest income, deposits, and loans. In the fourth quarter, net interest income increased by approximately $710 million on a sequential basis, largely driven by Services, Cards and Markets. Average loans were down, as growth in Cards was more than offset by declines in ICG and Legacy Franchises. Excluding foreign exchange translation, loans were flat. And average deposits were down by approximately 1%, largely driven by declines in Legacy Franchises and the impact of foreign exchange translation. Excluding foreign exchange translation, deposits were up 2%. Sequentially, average deposits were up, driven by growth in ICG and PBWM and our net interest margin increased by 8 basis points. On Slide 11, we show key consumer and corporate credit metrics. We are well reserved for the current environment with over $19 billion of reserves. Our reserves-to-funded loans ratio is approximately 2.6%. And within that, PBWM and U.S. Cards is 3.8% and 7.6% respectively, both just above day 1 CECL levels. And we feel very good about the high-quality nature of our portfolios. In PBWM, 45% of our lending exposures are in US cards, and of that, Branded Cards makes up 66% and Retail Services makes up 34%. Additionally, just over 80% of our total Cards exposure is to prime customers. And NCL rates continue to be well below pre-COVID levels. In our ICG portfolio, of our total exposure, over 80% is investment grade. Of the international exposure, approximately 90% is investment grade or exposure to multinational clients or their subsidiaries. And corporate non-accrual loans remain low and are in line with pre-pandemic levels at about 39 basis points of total loans. That said, we continuously analyze our portfolios and concentrations under a range of scenarios. So, while the macro and geopolitical environment remains uncertain, we feel very good about our asset quality, exposures, and reserve levels. On Slide 12, we show our summary balance sheet and key capital and liquidity metrics. We maintain a very strong balance sheet. Of our $2.4 trillion balance sheet, about a quarter, or just under $569 billion, consists of HQLA and we maintain total liquidity resources of approximately $1 trillion. And our tangible book value per share was $81.65, up 3% from a year ago. On Slide 13, we show a sequential CET1 walk to provide more detail on the drivers this quarter and our targets over the next few quarters. Walking from the end of the third quarter: first, we generated $2.3 billion of net income to common which added 19 basis points. Second, we returned $1.0 billion in the form of common dividends, which drove a reduction of about 9 basis points. Third, the impact on AOCI through our AFS investment portfolio drove an 8 basis point increase. And finally, the remaining 56 basis point increase was largely driven by the closing of exits, RWA optimization, and market moves towards the end of the quarter. We ended the quarter with a 13% CET1 capital ratio, approximately 70 bps higher than the last quarter. As you can see, we hit our 13% CET1 target, which includes a 100 bps internal management buffer, that will allow us to absorb any temporary impacts related to the Mexico Consumer exit at signing, while continuing to have ample capacity to serve our clients. And as it relates to buybacks this quarter, we will remain on pause and continue to make that decision quarter-by-quarter. On Slide 14, we show the results for our Institutional Clients Group for the fourth quarter. Revenues increased by 3% this quarter, with TTS revenue up 36% on continued strength in NII. Securities Services revenue up 22%. Markets revenue up 18% on strength in Fixed Income, partially offset by a decline in Equities. And Investment Banking revenues down 58%, which is in the range of the overall decline in industry volumes. Expenses increased 6%, driven by transformation, business-led investments, specifically in Services, and volume-related expenses, partially offset by FX translation and productivity savings. Cost of credit was $56 million, driven by net credit losses of $104 million, partially offset by an ACL release. This resulted in net income of approximately $1.9 billion, down 18%, driven by higher cost of credit and higher expenses. ICG delivered an 7.9% RoTCE for the quarter. And average loans were down slightly largely driven by the impact of foreign exchange translation and our continued capital optimization efforts. Excluding FX, loans were up 1%. Average deposits were roughly flat. Excluding the impact of foreign exchanges translation, deposits were up 3%. And sequentially, deposits were up 4%. As for the full year, ICG grew revenues by 3% to $41 billion and delivered approximately $10.7 billion of net income with an RoTCE of 11.1%. Now turning to Slide 15, we show the results for our Personal Banking & Wealth Management business. Revenues were up 5% as net interest income growth was partially offset by a decline in non-interest revenue, driven by lower investment product revenue in Wealth and higher partner payments in Retail Services. Expenses were up 7%, driven by investments in transformation and other risk and control initiatives. Cost of credit was $1.7 billion, which included a reserve build, driven by card volume growth and a deterioration in macroeconomic assumptions. NCLs are up reflecting ongoing normalization particularly in Retail Services. Average loans increased 6% while average deposits decreased 1%, largely reflecting clients putting cash to work in fixed income investments on our platform. And PBWM delivered an RoTCE of 1.4% driven by the ACL build this quarter and higher expenses. For the full year, PBWM delivered an RoTCE of 10.2% on $24.2 billion in revenues. On Slide 16, we show results for Legacy Franchises. Revenues decreased 6%, primarily driven by the closings of 5 exit markets, as well as the impact of the wind-downs. Expenses decreased 38%, largely driven by the absence of divestiture-related impacts last year related to Korea. On Slide 17, we show results for Corporate / Other for the fourth quarter. Revenues increased, largely driven by higher net revenue from the investment portfolio. Expenses are down, driven by lower consulting expenses. On slide 19, we summarize our guidance for 2023. As Jane mentioned earlier, 2023 is a continuation of Phase 1 – we will continue to execute and invest – laying the foundation for the future with an eye toward driving long-term shareholder value. With that as a backdrop, we expect revenue to be in the range of $78 - $79 billion, excluding any potential 2023 divestiture-related impacts. Expenses to be roughly $54 billion, also excluding 2023 divestiture-related impacts. Net credit losses in Cards is expected to continue to normalize. And as we said earlier, we met our 13% CET1 target and we will continue to evaluate that target as we go through the next DFAST cycle and close additional exits and announce others. On slide 20, on the right side of the page, we show our revenue for 2021 and 2022 and our expectations for 2023, excluding the impact of divestitures. In 2023, we expect the revenue growth I just mentioned to be driven by NII and NIR. In TTS, we expect revenue to grow, but at a slower pace, driven by interest rates and business actions. And for Securities Services, we expect a bit of a tailwind from increased market valuations and onboarding of additional client assets. We also assume somewhat of a normalization in Wealth as lockdowns in China end and market valuations start to rebound. And we expect Investment Banking to begin to rebound as the macroeconomic backdrop becomes more conducive to client activity. As for Markets, we expect it to be relatively flat given the level of activity we saw in 2022. Now, turning to the NII guidance for 2023. We expect both ICG and PBWM to contribute to NII growth as we grow volumes, particularly in Cards, and we continue to get the benefit of US and non-US rate hikes in our Services businesses. As a reminder, the guidance for revenue includes the reduction of revenue from the exits in Legacy franchises that we closed in 2022 and we expect to close this year in 2023. Turning to slide 21, in 2023, the increase in expenses that I just mentioned reflects a number of decisions we have made to further our transformation and execute on our strategy. And the main drivers are: first, Transformation, as we continue to invest in data, risk & controls, and technology to enhance our infrastructure and ultimately make our company more efficient. Second, business led investments as we execute against our strategy. Third, volume-related expenses – in line with our revenue expectations. And fourth, elevated levels of inflation, mainly impacting compensation expense, partially offset by productivity savings and expense benefits from the exits. And we are investing in technology across the firm, with total technology-related expenses increasing by 5%. While we recognize this is a significant increase in expenses, these are investments we have to make, and these investments will make us a better, more efficient company in the future. And finally, let’s talk a little bit about the medium-term targets. At Investor Day we said the medium-term was 3-5 years. That time frame represented 2024 to 2026. So, while a lot has changed in the macro environment since Investor Day, our strategy has not, and we are on a path to the 11-12% RoTCE targets in the medium term. We continue to expect top line revenue growth, material expense reductions, and capital levels largely consistent with our medium-term CET1 target range to contribute to the achievement of our 11-12% ROTCE target. So let me walk you through where we stand today. From a revenue perspective, rates have moved much higher and at a faster pace across the globe which accelerated NII growth – and that coupled with the execution of our strategy has allowed certain businesses to accelerate. At the same time other businesses, such as Wealth and Investment Banking have slowed. Despite this, consistent with Investor Day, we expect a 4-5% revenue CAGR in the medium term, including the ongoing reduction of revenue from the closing of the exits. From an expense perspective, as we showed at Investor Day, expenses will need to normalize over the medium term. And we now expect to the bend the curve on expenses towards the end of 2024. The three main drivers of the necessary expense reduction will be benefits from the exits, which will be included in Legacy Franchises, the benefits from our investments in Transformation and controls, and the simplification of the organizational structure. First, let me remind you that at this point, the ongoing expenses in Legacy Franchises are approximately $7 billion. Of the $7 billion, roughly $4 billion is transferred to the buyer upon closing or through a transition services agreement that typically lasts about a year. The remaining $3 billion relates to potentially stranded costs and the wind downs, which takes time to eliminate. Second, as our investments in Transformation and control initiatives mature, we expect to realize efficiencies as those programs transition from manually intensive processes to technology-enabled ones. And finally, we remain focused on simplifying the organization and we expect to generate further opportunities for expense reductions in the future. From a credit perspective, we still expect net credit losses to continue to normalize and any future ACL builds or releases will be a function of macro assumptions and volumes. So, to wrap up, while the world has changed significantly and the components have shifted, we remain on our path to achieve the 11-12% RoTCE in the medium term and Jane, the rest of the firm, and I are prepared to continue to show proof points along the way and demonstrate our progress. With that, Jane and I would be happy to take your questions.","capital ratio, billion, , revenue, net income, liquidity, million, loan growth, trillion, net interest income, cet1",yes,Yes,"cet1, capital ratio",No,,Yes,reserve build,Yes,dfast,No,,No,,No,,Yes,net interest margin
2022,Q4,"Question And Answer
Operator","Our first question will come from Glenn Schorr with Evercore, your line is now open.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Glenn Schorr,"Definitely appreciate all these outlook slides, they're very helpful. So, my question on the outlooks is if you take a look at the current medium-sized return on tangible and getting to your target. I heard many comments about the path to getting there is on track. Is it the expense bend at the end of '24, that is the material step-up from here to there, if you will, and/or is credit like a really big determinant in the process? I'm trying to bridge the gap just in numbers from today's return on tangible targets. Thanks.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Mark Mason,"Yes, sure, good morning, Glenn, thanks for the question. So, we did give you some guidance here, we gave it to you both on the top line and the middle line for '23. And then importantly, when we talk about the medium term, it's both the continued revenue growth, the 4% to 5% CAGR that I referenced, but it's also bringing the expenses down from this '23 forecast. And I mentioned in the prepared remarks, the drivers of what's going to bring these expenses down, the combination of the exit of the businesses and the expenses going away associated with that, with the benefits that we start to generate from the transformation spend and then org simplification that this type of strategic restructuring, if you will, in exiting all these countries, will create an opportunity for. And so, it's a combination of revenue growth, expense bending of that curve and coming down. The cost of credit is kind of as we've been talking about for some time now, which is it normalizes over the next couple of years at levels that are consistent with what we've seen kind of prior to this COVID cycle that we've been managing through.",revenue,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Glenn Schorr,"Okay. I appreciate that. Just one quick follow-up on and totally not my norm, but I normally try to respect this type of process. But Mark, we consider you a super important part of this transformation. There's been news out there that you're talking to one of my other companies. But would you be able to make any comment on this? You mentioned staying on. Sorry to put you on the spot, but I think a lot of people care.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Mark Mason,"I appreciate that, Glenn. Citi is an important firm. I'm the CFO of this firm and this strategy is something that I'm focused on with Jane, ensuring that we execute on right and in a way that creates shareholder value for our investors. And so, we're committed to getting that done.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,

2022,Q4,Operator,Our next question will come from John McDonald with Autonomous Research.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,John Mcdonald,"Mark, I wanted to dig into the revenue outlook for 2023. You've got about the midpoint, it kind of implies about 4% revenue growth this year, kind of consistent with what you talked about for that 4% to 5%. So, for this year, the 2023 guide, it looks like the NII is guided to be up about 3.5% and the Markets you're assuming kind of flat. So, what's enabling you to get to the 4%? Where are the drivers that are above 4%? Is it some of those fee businesses? And just a little more color there would be helpful.",revenue,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Mark Mason,"Sure. So let me make a comment first on the NII. Just keep in mind with that number that I've given on the page is both the growth that occurs in some of our important Services businesses, and that really comes from both the annualization of rate increases that we saw in the back half of the year but also expected continued increases, particularly outside of the U.S. And given the make-up of our franchise, that will contribute to the NII growth. And then keep in mind that we're growing over the Legacy Franchise reductions in NII that we would see in 2023. So, underneath that is some real momentum in the NII, notwithstanding a slower pace, the fact that it would be a slower pace than what we saw in 2022. From an NIR point of view, I did mention that we do expect to see some normalization in market valuation. And that would play out both in Banking, normalizing certainly relative to what we saw this year with wallets down 50% to 60%, as well as some normalization in Wealth and those would hit the NIR line, as you point out.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,John Mcdonald,"Okay. Sorry, if this is clear already. But just in terms of the idea of the cost curve bending at the end of 2024. Is that going to mean that for the early part of 2024, expenses kind of rise above 2023 and then they kind of peak out, plateau, towards the back half of '24, is that how we should envision it?",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Mark Mason,"I'm not going to kind of get into '24 guidance, we'll kind of get through '23, and I'm confident about our ability to get to that roughly 54 number that I put out for '23. I'm equally confident that we will bend this curve, and we'll bring it down to the levels that it needs to be in order for us to get to the RoTCE target, but I'm not going to kind of get into, John, the specifics of '24 except to say that by the end of '24, we will see that curve bending.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Operator,"Our next question will come from Erika Najarian with UBS, your line is now open.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Erika Najarian,"My first question is – again, thank you for all the clarification on the slide. Great job, Jenn and Tom, and Mark, obviously. But as we think about what it means to bend the curve, I think your investors are appreciative that you are accelerating the investments relative to your transformation. As we think about when Citi can hit that medium-term RoTCE, how should we think about what bending the curve really means? And I'm not looking for guidance necessarily, but as we think about going past that hump, what's the better way of measuring? Is it an efficiency ratio? I think you mentioned something like it is the 60% to 63% efficiency ratio against that 4% to 5% revenue CAGR that you think you'll be able to hit by 2025? Can we think of it that way?",revenue,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Mark Mason,"Yes, so at Investor Day, we did talk about it, and we remain consistent and committed to that. We talked about getting to an efficiency ratio that's less than 60% in the medium-term period. And so that certainly will be part of the metric that we deliver on as we bring our costs down. I think the other thing I'd mention, you mentioned the how, and I think there are a couple of important aspects to that, the exits are obvious in terms of those costs going away, at least a portion of it is. The portion that's tied to stranded costs, Jane has been very, very clear with our entire management team of the importance of rethinking the organization and ensuring that the potentially stranded costs go away, and that means rethinking the way we do business and the way we operate different parts of our operations. I think the third piece is technology, right? And so right now, a lot of what we're doing is manual. And as we continue to invest in technology -- and technology is up pretty significantly this year, 14% or so, we expect it to be up 5% next year. That technology build-out, if you will, will allow for us to reduce a lot of that manual activity, and that will bring down the operational cost for running the firm. And so those are a couple of examples, I hope, of the how. But I think importantly, you will start to see it in an improved operating efficiency over that period of time and getting to the target that we talked about at Investor Day.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Jane Fraser,"And I would say you can get some confidence around the path on many of these by the urgency with which we're executing the divestitures, for example, on getting those transactions closed. And we've also tried to provide you as much clarity as possible about the timing of when these will be closing and the speed of the wind downs that we're executing. So that will help. As Mark said, it's 3 big structural drivers of what will bend that curve.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Erika Najarian,"And Mark, I'm sorry, for misspeaking. I was looking at the wrong bar on efficiency. I have like 15 slides open on the computer. The second question, and maybe this is to you Jane, I think that your investors have appreciated your sense of urgency with regards to divestitures. I think the elephant in the room continues to be, I think, investors sort of expected an announcement on Banamex right now. And I'm wondering if you're still considering just selling Banamex. Or are you thinking about different options on the table, such as an IPO?",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Jane Fraser,"So, we're in active dialogue at the moment, so I'm obviously not going to comment in great detail here. We do continue to pursue a dual path as you'd expect, because both are very viable options here. And when we are in a position to give you clarity we will do so. I think we've been fairly clear about the timing. We are also separating out the 2 franchises, our institutional franchise from the consumer franchise that we're selling because we see the institutional franchise as a very important part of the global network. As you can imagine, in today's environment, Mexico is key for many of our corporate clients around the world for their supply chains and we play a very important role there. That is a lot of work in that separation. I'm extremely pleased with the progress that we're making in that underlying work. But we are pursuing the dual tracks and when we have something to announce, we will be delighted to do so.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Operator,Our next question will come from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is now open.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Mike Mayo,"I'm still trying to get over at this revenue and expense guidance, so you're implying you'll have at a minimum, flat operating leverage or positive operating leverage for 2023? Am I reading that correctly? So, on the one hand, you're not bending the cost curve until late 2024. On the other hand, you're guiding for positive operating leverage in 2023. Am I reading that correctly?",revenue,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Mark Mason,"Mike, when you do the math, I don't think it will get to the positive operating leverage in 2023. But we are, as you see on the slide, targeting a range that does reflect growth in the top line. That growth will likely be a little bit less than the growth that roughly 54 number would suggest, but we are on the right track, and we are getting there in a way that's consistent with the strategy that we talked about. And we do feel confident in our ability to deliver on the guidance that we've put out here, similar to delivering on the guidance we gave last year, recognizing there are a lot of things going on in the broader environment.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Mike Mayo,"Okay. And then a second follow-up – or a follow-up, and then I'll re-queue for my other question. Your CET1 ratio is 13% now and I think that's 2 quarters earlier than consensus had expected, you said it was up 70 basis points. So, doesn't that allow you to repurchase stock now? Or I understand that if you go ahead and sell Banamex, that could have a temporary negative capital hit. So, I'm just thinking, like don't sell Banamex, don't have that temporary capital hit, start buying back stock at a fraction of your tangible book value. So, what's wrong with my logic or what part of that can you comment on?",cet1,no,Yes,cet1,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,Yes,cet1 ratio
2022,Q4,Jane Fraser,"I'm going to jump in on the don't sell Banamex, Mike. As you could imagine, so we are selling the consumer franchise, it does not fit with the strategy that we laid out in Investor Day. It's an emerging market consumer franchise, and we are clearly focused around the multinational clients and in institutions and high-net worth individuals with cross-border needs as we laid out very clearly and businesses that have strong connectivity between each other. So, we don't see Banamex having strategic fit in the consumer franchises in that perspective. And when we run all the math, it is in the shareholders' interest that we sell that franchise and deploy that capital to our shareholders or into some of the investments at higher returns. What you're suggesting is a very short-term move. And I think as you can see from the actions we're taking, we're very focused on our medium and long term and not taking the short-term path that we would regret in the medium and long term.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Operator,Our next question will come from Ebrahim Poonawala with Bank of America. Your line is now open,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Ebrahim Poonawala,"I guess just one question as a follow-up on capital. As we think about post the second half of the year, let's say, you've taken the hit from Banamex. But coming out of the stress test, any sense, Mark, if there's any reason why Citi would have an outsized negative impact from the Basel end game reforms? Just give us a sense, I'm just wondering hopefully, we don't get another disappointment as we get our hopes high for buybacks in the back half and there's something idiosyncratic about the business mix that could come back to hurt the bank? Would love any perspective there.",,no,No,,No,,No,,Yes,stress test,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Mark Mason,"So, look, as we pointed out, we've built a significant amount of capital over the course of the year. We are ahead of the target we set for the middle of the year. We do have some exits that will have a temporary impact on that CET1 ratio. And we do obviously have a DFAST that's in front of us that we'll have to see what the outcome is of that work. I think the Basel end-game and final views and decisions on that are still outstanding. And I think we'll have to take those into consideration when they become available. That is an industry dynamic that will play out however it plays out. And similar to SACCR, we'll get after it in a very significant way to make sure that we're able to handle whatever headwinds or tailwinds may come along with that. But it really is difficult at this point to opine on exactly what that means for the industry in light of the fact that there aren't final rules out just yet.",cet1,yes,Yes,cet1,No,,No,,Yes,dfast,No,,No,,No,,Yes,cet1 ratio
2022,Q4,Ebrahim Poonawala,"Got it. And just back to your medium-term targets. I guess if we hit that bending the curve at the end of '24, it implies that this company should have an earnings power north of $10 by '25 even at the lower end of the guidance. Am I missing anything there? Or does that make sense?",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Mark Mason,"The only thing I’d point out is, what I’ve described, what Jane’s described, is the medium term is 2024 through 2026. And we’ve given you guidance for 2023. We intend to get those return targets in the medium-term. I haven’t given you specific guidance on any of those individual years, and we’ll kind of take that year by year. And so just factor in, I think what’s important is you’ve got a view on 2023, and I think we’ve given you additional clarity on how we intend to get to that medium-term, and I think that’s important.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Operator,Our next question will come from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Betsy Graseck,"I did want to ask a little bit about the strategy with Personal Banking and Wealth Management. I know Jane, earlier you talked about the fact that – which you have announced looking for a new head to move that business forward – could you just give us a sense as to where you think the opportunity sets are greatest within that franchise for growth, because there's a bunch of different pieces, some on the advice channel, some of the more fee channels, some of the more balance sheet piece. And you already indicated U.S. as an opportunity to expand into. So, I'd just like to understand, from your perspective, which pieces are the most important to execute on. And that could help us understand how you're planning on shaping this business going forward?",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Jane Fraser,"Great question, Betsy, and Mark and I are both smiling here because I think the answer is all of the above. So, if we break it down, where do we see the various elements of upside? There's an important recovery that's going to occur in Asia. And you can see from our results last year, and across the board with other competitors with an Asian bend, that was materially impacted by COVID in China and the lockdowns and a slower pulling out of COVID in that market compared, broadly in Asia, compared to the U.S. So, we see some exciting growth opportunities there from the pure fundamentals in Asia across the board. You're absolutely right, in the U.S., we start from a smaller scale there. We've been bringing the different parts of that business together. The Wealth at Work franchise is one that's had particularly pleasing growth in it. And we've also been seeing some good growth as we pulled a comprehensive offering together for our customers. The biggest upside there is investment products. And I think we've got a strong balance sheet franchise as it were, particularly the deposits, some of the margin lending and the like, mortgages, but this is really about the investment offering in the States. Then finally, I'd say there's also tremendous opportunity in the synergies, and we've been showing you this in terms of linkages between our Commercial Bank, our Banking franchise, the referrals up from the U.S. Personal Banking, we've had about 60,000 referrals this year in the U.S. alone from that, Markets also provides important referrals and even TTS. So, there are client referrals, there are business synergies between the common platforms, so we really see an opportunity for this multi-dimensional growth drivers in Wealth over and above the recovery in the investment space that everybody in the market should be able to benefit from. And we'll continue investing appropriately in building out that front line as well. So, this is a very important part of our strategy. We're excited about it, it's the key pillar of the shift in business mix as we go forward as well, looking at the medium term. And we're looking forward to the next phase of growth and focus here.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Betsy Graseck,And would you say that the investment spend required to execute on those revenue opportunities is likely to accelerate from here? Or you've already done that investment spend and the investment is more sideways as opposed to accelerating?,revenue,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Jane Fraser,"I think in this current environment, as we've said, Mark and I have both said since middle of last year, this is something that we're pacing, but we're continuing to invest behind it. And you can see that growth in our client advisers, and remember that net growth in client advisers includes the divestiture we made in Uruguay, for example, so it's pretty strong. We don't have a huge amount that we need to invest because we have many pieces of the platform in place, and it's more been a story of integrating them and then making sure that we're putting the right digital and other investments behind it, but it's not such a large one in order to achieve the upside in the business, and we'll pace that as appropriate with market conditions. Mark, anything to add?",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Mark Mason,"Betsy, and you know this is, in a normal part of the cycle, this is a high margin, high-returning business and we've seen that in the past. And so, we want to be well positioned for, as the market turns, having brought on client advisers, having brought in new clients through client acquisitions, which were up 24% in 2022. And so, I think we're well positioned for that. But as Jane mentioned, given where we are, we want to be smart about how we deploy the dollars. And so, we'll re-pace as necessary, but ensure that we're ready for when things turn.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Jane Fraser,"And I'd just add, it was a couple of years ago that we announced the strategy and started executing on it, so we have the benefit of the historic investments, we're seeing the drivers playing out well. And as I say, we should be well positioned when the market turns here.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Operator,Our next question will come from Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open. MATT O’,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Connor,"I just want to follow up on the comments about expecting Markets to be relatively flat in '23. Obviously, a very good 4Q and I know at least I was concerned about some of the RWA management and FICC in recent quarters and I think that proved not to be an issue as you think about leadership and revenue. But as you think about '23, like the wallets have been strong in recent years. And to your point, your FICC leadership was strong this year. How confident are you in kind of that flat Markets? And maybe what's driving that view?",revenue,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Mark Mason,"It's a Market business, right? And so, you know very well kind of the volatility that can come with any Markets business. With that said, we've got a very, very strong FICC franchise. We had a very good year this year. I think we're well positioned with the client base, and we're well positioned to maintain our #1 position as we go into 2023(1). Now how that market and market wallet moves, I think, is going to predicate on a number of things, including how the macro continues to evolve and how central bank activity continues to evolve and how currencies move and the like. But again, I feel like we're well positioned to hold our position, if not gain more share as that plays out. So, I think flat relative to a year that we've had up as significantly as it is, is a reasonable call based on what we know now.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Jane Fraser,"We've also seen some depression of areas of strength in this business as well. So, Equity Derivatives, for example, is a real strength, this was an Equity Derivatives year. So, there's some -- and the corporate world with the volatility that's out there from a macro geopolitical environment is another real strength of ours. And for better or for worse, we're expecting that strength to continue, certainly so far.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Operator,Our next question will come from Jim Mitchell with Seaport Global. Your line is now open.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Jim Mitchell,"Mark, maybe just digging into NII a little bit. If you look at 4Q annualized, you have a decent step down, but when you take a look at your deposit franchise, your mix of business versus your peers, where they're seeing probably lagging retail deposits in the U.S., pricing that's going to hurt second half NII, you already have high betas, mostly institutional. You mentioned the benefit from non-U.S. rates and you're growing deposits. So why a similar trend in NII versus peers when you have a pretty different dynamic going on? Just trying to think that through because it doesn't look like the Legacy you drag is very big in your chart.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Mark Mason,Similar dynamics you say in '23 or you're talking about the fourth quarter? I'm not sure I followed.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Jim Mitchell,"I'm just trying to talk about versus peers, some have guided similarly to down from 4Q annualized run rates, but you have a very different dynamic in terms of deposit growth, benefits from non U.S. rates and a much higher beta.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Mark Mason,"I mean I think I'd point to a couple of things on the NII side, just as it relates to us. One, importantly, that I mentioned in, and you point out is when you think about our mix of deposits, we've got about 65% or so in ICG and the balance, 35%, in our PBWM business. We certainly skew to U.S. dollar, but we've got a 30% or so that is a non-U.S. dollar. And when I think about the potential or the forward curves and how rates will likely move next year, we will get the benefit of further rate increases on the non-U.S. side, right? And so, if I think about our international presence, the betas tend to not be as high as they are here in the U.S. with our Corporate Clients segment. And so, I think there's some repricing opportunities that we'll continue to actively manage as we did here in the U.S. And so, I do think it’s that international footprint, the globality of our franchise that plays to our strength in 2023. The other thing that is apparent to us as we forecast this out, is the continued growth from a volume point of view. And that volume growth – you've seen the momentum already pick up on the Cards side with significant growth in interest-earning balances and we'd expect that to continue, particularly as we see NCLs normalize and as we see payment rates start to temper. And so, I think those things will be 2 major contributors. Mix is obviously a factor. As you point out, we will be growing over some of the drag or reduction from Legacy. But it's that active management of the client engagement that we have across both portfolios that I think will be important factors to us delivering the growth that I talked about.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Jim Mitchell,"No and that's all fair. But I guess maybe I didn't phrase my question right, but I felt like ex Markets, I think your forecast for 2023 would be less than the 4Q run rate ex-Markets. And you shared a bunch of reasons why you have sort of a differentiated franchise. So, I'm just trying to get a sense of what's driving the decline from 4Q levels.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Mark Mason,"I think the thing you've got to pick up is really the Legacy franchise and the NII. A large part of the Legacy franchise revenues are NII revenues when you look at the mix of the products and the clients that we cover there. And so, I think that's the important element here that we haven't quantified to a dollar amount, but that is explaining why it seems like muted growth relative to what you would have seen in the fourth quarter. Obviously, there's other factors, but that's important.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Operator,Our next question will come from Gerard Cassidy with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Gerard Cassidy,"Mark, can you share with us on your comments regarding, and this is true for your peers as well, the normalization of credit losses going forward since the industry has experienced incredibly low levels of credit losses. So, when you look at Branded Cards or Retail Services, how do you see that progressing through '23? One of your peers pointed out that they think that by the end of '23, they may be at that normalization rate that they look to for their numbers, but I'm just trying to see what the trajectory is for what you guys are thinking.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Jane Fraser,"Yes, let me jump in and then I'll hand it on to Mark. I think we are expecting, under the current trajectory, to see the loss rates to reach the pre-COVID levels more at the year-end, early '24 level. If you think of Branded Cards, if I was to quantify, it is 20% of the way there now, CRS, we're about 40% of the way there now. Obviously, we have the benefit in CRS of sharing of the loss sharing with our partners, that helps us. But I hope that gives you a sense around it, probably the most important driver that we've been worried about, it was very uncertain with what was happening with payment rates. And I think we've got much more clarity as they started that normalization path, so that's driving a fair amount more certainty around what the direction is happening there. Frankly, the big question is more what's happening with spending than it is with the normalization right now. It's a bigger uncertainty. But Mark, any other observations?",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Mark Mason,"The only thing I'd add is that, Gerard, you could see just depending on how this plays out, you could see kind of NCL rates tick up above normal levels and then come back down to normal levels in the timeline that Jane described, again, just depending on how the macro factors continue to play out. But again, as we sit here and talk about these NCL rates, it's important to point out as well that we're very well reserved across all of these portfolios, and so to some extent, if you put macro assumptions aside and volumes aside, the NCLs kind of get funded by the reserves that have been established. But the trend line is exactly as Jane described, just recognizing that you could see a tick-up above normal levels and then it come back down.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Jane Fraser,"Also, this is such an unusual market in the sense that you've got such strong labor market, driven by, frankly, supply shortage almost as much as demand. And we've also got the consumers with still very high savings that they're dipping into, and we're seeing a bit more of the movements happening at the bottom end of all of this. But this is not going to be like a normal recession, that’s why you hear us and others talking about the manageability and the mildness that’s likely if we do have one.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Gerard Cassidy,And what kind of unemployment rates are you guys assuming going into that kind of trajectory? Is it we get to 5% unemployment by first quarter '24?,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Mark Mason,"I think a couple of things. So, one, our base case scenario, if you think about what we just talked about includes kind of a mild recession in it, just as we forecasted it. The downside would be something a bit more severe than that. I'd say we're reserved for approximately a 5% unemployment rate just kind of overall when you average across the different scenarios that we have.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Operator,Our next question will come from Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Your line is now open.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Ken Usdin,"Just 2 quick questions. First one, just on Cards, Card NIM has been kind of flattish and I know that obviously has to do with just how you internally allocate the funding towards it. But can you just kind of talk us through what's happening either with rewards or either incremental teaser rates on some of the new relationships and should we see the Card NIM expand from here?",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Mark Mason,"I'm not going to get into, Ken, kind of guidance on NIM. What I will say is that we have seen good traction in the early part of the year as it relates to acquisitions on the Card side. We've made very good traction, and Jane, you may want to comment on kind of the relationships that we have with some of the partners, and with American. And we've also launched a number of new products that I think is helping to fuel the growth that we've seen on the heels of those investments and some of the increase that we've seen in spend rates as well as some of the average interest-earning balance and loan growth that we've seen. But I really don't want to get into the NIM guidance at the Card level or the aggregate at this point.",loan growth,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Jane Fraser,"I mean we have a fabulous Cards franchise. And when we look at strong track record in the digital, the other innovations that are driving growth, driving the profitability, driving the returns both in our proprietary products as well as with our partners. And we're really seeing all of those drivers performing very, very strongly at the moment. From Custom Cash, that was 28% of new account acquisitions. So, an important new product refresh that's driving things, 80% of customers engaging digitally. Innovations like American, is just a fantastic partner of ours, really taking that to the next level. And you can see that with the growth in spend in the category. So, I think there's a lot of reasons to be pretty excited about the growth in the returns and the margins and the other trajectories here. And as I say, a prime portfolio, which is always a good thing.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Ken Usdin,"Great, thanks. And my second question was, there was an article about changing management up in the Wealth Management business this week. And I just wonder if you can talk about that, but also just about the progress that you're making inside the Wealth Management relative to your, the KPIs and the goals that you discussed at Analyst Day.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Jane Fraser,"Well, sure. I mean, 2 years ago, I asked Jim O'Donnell to put the Wealth business together from the various components that we had around the firm. And now, as we move to the next phase, but as we've said, a strategically important business, I thought it was the right time to change the leadership also because Jim is going to play an important role moving forward, supporting Paco with the ICG strategy that we laid out at Investor Day. He's got a lot of relationships with investors, family offices, private equity, sovereign wealth funds, and he's going to be helping drive those along with other investors to make sure we bring the firm's full capabilities to these clients. So, I felt the time was right to make the move. And we will be, as indicated, swiftly moving to go out and have a look for our next leader of that business. And in the meantime, it’s business as usual as we grow out and follow the strategy that we have, and we're looking forward to the market turning, as I'm sure everyone is, and feel that we're well positioned to do so.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Operator,Our next question will come from Steven Chubak with Wolfe. Your line is now open.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Sharon Leung,"This is actually Sharon Leung filling in for Steven. Just on the topic of credit, one of your peers noted this morning that they would expect to see an incremental $6 billion or so of reserves if they assume 6% unemployment under CECL. Just wondering if you could provide some similar sensitivity to reserve levels, and how should we think about the provision trajectory versus the 4Q base based on your macro outlook and potential growth mass headwinds?",billion,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Mark Mason,"I'm not going to kind of do sensitivity scenarios with you here on the fly. What I will say is that as we build these reserves, we are building them against 3 scenarios, that base scenario that I mentioned, the downside scenario, and upside scenario, and we weight those scenarios. And the base that we used this quarter built in a mild recession. And in that baseline, unemployment was, call it 4.4% or so in terms of the unemployment assumption. We also had a downside scenario. Unemployment in the downside scenario got to a 6.9% or so. And then we had an upside scenario. The weighted average across the quarters was about the 5.1% that I mentioned. And those were factors that went into the reserve that we established in the quarter. And largely, when you think about the weightings we put on those scenarios, the weighting skewed towards that base and that downside. The reserve we built this quarter was largely in the consumer business, PBWM and specifically around Cards. And that really had to do the change quarter-over-quarter with the change in HPI. But what I would say is that it also reflects, as I mentioned earlier, a Cards portfolio that remains of a very good quality and with loss rates that are well below what they would be in a normal cycle. And it does pick up the fact that there's volume growth that we saw in the quarter there. So, I'm not going to kind of run scenarios for you, but hopefully that gives you some perspective as to what's underneath the models that we've used to establish these reserves. And obviously, we do that on a quarter-by-quarter basis.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Jane Fraser,"I'd also just jump in, one of the areas that sometimes gets misthought of about the firm, is on the corporate credit side. When we look at our corporate client portfolio, don't equate where we take credit risk with the global footprint. When I look internationally, 90% of our international exposure are with multinational firms and their subsidiaries, and these, all this is investment grade. I think that's another area whereas we look at the quality of the corporate loan portfolio, as you saw with Russia and others, we will be conservative in the reserving we take. But I think important to understand the nature of where we take that corporate credit risk.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Sharon Leung,"That's really helpful, thanks. And then as a follow-up, it seems like a part of your revenue targets for 2023 depends on some improvement in the environment. For example, stabilizing equity markets, IB rebound. And Jane, you also noted that the medium-term targets are designed to be achievable in different environments. So, if the revenue backdrop continues to be challenged like we saw in 2022, can you just talk about some of the levers you might be able to pull that might provide an offset?",revenue,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Mark Mason,"Well, it kind of depends on what the drivers are of a different environment, right? Because you could have, I don't anticipate this, but you could have continued pressure in Investment Banking, but you could also have continued volatility in rates or currencies and that could mean more upside than flat for the Markets business. So, there are a lot of puts and takes that one can scenario out. I think what's really important is that we have a diversified portfolio of businesses that have strategic connectivity to them. And so what that allows for is that as the environment shifts in some way that we may not have predicted that we were often able to still drive significant performance as we did this year and so, without calling exactly how it might vary from what’s here, that's what gives us the confidence around the guidance and really to remain steadfast on the strategy that we've talked about and really push execution, and that's exactly what we're doing.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Jane Fraser,"And an important part of '23, it's not just the impact of the cycle, but also, you'll see the impact of the different investments that we've been making. And you've certainly seen that, for example, in Services this year, and we've been very transparent around the 70 basis point increase we've seen in wallet share in the 12 months leading up to the third quarter. So, you've not only got drivers here in terms of what's happening in the market, but you've also got the strategic drivers, also kicking in more and more together as Mark referred to the synergies.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Mark Mason,"That’s a great point, Jane, because it may not always show up in the top line, which is why we put those KPIs out there. There are often indicators of some of the upside that's on the come as the market evolves.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Operator,Our last question will come from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is now open.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Mike Mayo,"So, one question, one follow-up. So, your slide says you have a CET1 target of 13% by mid year, but you're already there. And I guess, if we go back to the Banamex thing, is that kind of assuming potential capital impact from divestitures or why would you have a target 6 months out when you've already met it?",cet1,no,Yes,cet1,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Mark Mason,"Yes, Mike, I have to tell you I'm surprised that you're asking about Mexico, just given our history together, but I understand it. And what I would say is that a couple of things. One, we clearly see where we trade, right? And we're not happy about where we trade. And we think our strategy warrants us trading better than where we trade today. So, if we could buy back, right, if we could do buybacks, as soon as we're able to do buybacks, we will, right? I mean that is part of the way we deliver value for our shareholders. The second thing I'd say is we did get to the 13% sooner. And that was, again, in accordance with executing against our strategy. And our parts of our business, particularly the Markets business, has done a really good job at delivering against the metric we put out of revenue to RWA, and we've been able to get there without damaging the franchise, which is what you see in the continued strength and performance in that business, particularly in Fixed Income. What's ahead of us, as you rightfully pointed out, is that we've got a number of exits that have to take place, there's puts and takes across many of them. But Mexico, in particular, will have a temporary, temporary impact on our CET1 ratio. And so, we want to be mindful of that as we manage over the next 2 quarters so that we can absorb that. And we also want to make sure that we're positioned to continue to serve our clients over the next couple of quarters and always, but certainly over the next couple of quarters, while we manage the temporary headwind from that exit. So hopefully, that gives you a better sense for it, but we're actively managing this, and we have not lost focus on the importance of returning capital to shareholders.","revenue, cet1",yes,Yes,cet1,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,Yes,cet1 ratio
2022,Q4,Jane Fraser,"I want to reiterate that as well. I mean it's very important to us. And as Mark said, we know where we trade. We've made a number of moves to align ourselves to our shareholders' interest in compensation and management interest, all these various dimensions. And we just want to make sure that we hit what we say we're going to do and continue delivering against what we say we're going to be delivering. And with the CTA impact essentially in Mexico, we want to make sure that we're taking that into account.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Mike Mayo,"All right, that's very clear. And then lastly, your NII guide, excluding Markets related, is higher for 2023, but I think that implies a little step down from the fourth quarter level, not as much as JPMorgan was guiding down 10% from the fourth quarter level. I was thinking there might be some delayed benefits from being outside the U.S. What are some of the ins and outs there?",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Mark Mason,"Yes. You've got a couple of points here. So one is, we won't see NII momentum as we've seen in 2022, just as betas start to increase on the ICG side and get to terminal levels, that's obviously going to slow or put pressure on the pricing as we go into '23. But some of the other important drivers of the growth will be the annualization of the rate hikes that happened late in the year, and so that will be a plus in 2023. And you'll also see, as I mentioned earlier, some of the rate increases that we anticipate outside of the U.S. and given our mix, that will benefit us in 2023. And then there'll be volume that will contribute to that NII growth, particularly as we continue to see good momentum, which we anticipate on the Card side. The offset will be the Legacy franchise, right? And so, as those exits occur, as the wind downs continue, as I mentioned earlier, that revenue mix does skew towards NII and so we'll have to grow over that, and we will grow over that to kind of get to the target that we've set. So those are the puts and takes.",revenue,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Operator,There are no further questions at this time. I will now turn the call over to Jenn Landis for closing remarks.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Jennifer Landis,"Thank you everyone for joining us today. If you have any follow-up questions, please reach out to IR. Thank you.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q4,Jane Fraser,"Thank you, Jenn, and a very happy New Year to everyone. I hope you all had a good break. At Citi, we are back at it. Given the notable items, and our new financial reporting structure, we have a lot to cover today so I right to it. 2023 was a foundational year in which we made substantial progress simplifying Citi and executing the strategy we laid out at Investor Day. With that said the fourth quarter was clearly very disappointing. Today I will provide a high-level view on our progress in 2023, discuss our Q4 results, and finish with our priorities for 2024. We know 2024 is critical as we prepare to enter the next phase of our journey and we are completely focused on delivering our medium-term targets and our transformation. So, turning to what we accomplished in terms of executing our strategy. As you can see on slide 5, in 2023, we saw a record year for Services, where we maintained our #1 ranking among large institutions in TTS with client wins up 27% and a sustained win/loss rate above 80%. We have now gained over 100bps in share in Securities Services since 2021. In Wealth, we added an estimated $21 billion in net new assets during the year. In USPB we enjoyed our sixth consecutive quarter of growth, and we began to see the early fruits of our investments in key talent in Banking. In September, we began the most consequential series of changes to the organization and the running of our firm since the aftermath of the financial crisis. We restructured around five core, interconnected businesses to align our organization to our business strategy and to provide greater transparency into their performance. You now can see in our financials the full-year returns and P&L by business. While they are all impacted by investments and Transformation expense, it is clear where we have work to do. The simplification of our organization structure will conclude at the end of Q1 and will result in over $1 billion of run-rate saves from the net elimination of approximately five thousand roles, mainly managers. As Mark will detail, this will contribute to the reduction of our expens simplification, benefits of the Transformation, stranded costs and other productivity efforts, we expect to eliminate 20 thousand positions ex-Mexico, resulting in over $2 billion in run-rate saves. Simplification is also enabling Citi to be more client focused and less bureaucratic. Realizing the synergies between our five businesses is one of the key drivers to achieving our medium-term revenue targets. With this new structure, I am holding my business leaders accountable for enhancing connectivity across clients and products. In addition, having a Chief Client Officer acts to ensure we are disciplined in bringing the full power of our franchise to our clients. We have now completed the divestitures of 9 of our 14 international consumer franchises and have wound down nearly 70% of our total retail loans and deposits in Russia, Korea and China. We have restarted the sales process in Poland and are well down the execution path for the Mexico IPO next year. We are exiting marginal businesses such as Munis and a subset of distressed debt trading to focus on our core strengths and allocate our capital with rigor. Without doubt, all these changes are difficult, but they are necessary. At the same time, we continued to invest in our Transformation, risk and control environment and data architecture. We were pleased to have closed the FX consent order with the Federal Reserve. We are committed to fulfilling the expectations of our regulators given the unique role we play in the global financial system. The modernization of our tech infrastructure is proceeding at pace allowing us to deliver new capabilities to our clients. During the year, we consolidated trading and reporting platforms, and retired 6% of our legacy applications for the second year in a row. These enhancements dovetail with significant investments in our businesses, such as hiring commercial bankers to capture share, improving the digital payment capabilities we offer throughout our global network, and automating processes for our Securities Services clients. It was also a year where we upgraded talent with key internal promotions supplemented by selective external hires, including Andy Sieg. The simplified reporting structure has been embraced by colleagues who feel empowered by the new structure to serve clients and drive value for shareholders. Earlier this week we disclosed additional external headwinds some of which materialized in the second half of December including a $1.3 billion reserve build related to transfer risk stemming from exposures to Argentina and Russia. We also saw a nearly $900 million negative revenue impact as a result of the larger than expected devaluation of the Argentine currency. These items, together with the $1.7 billion FDIC assessment, drove this quarter to a negative EPS of $1.16. While these items are clearly very painful, they are quite In terms of the performance of our five businesses, while Services was the most impacted by the Argentine devaluation, the underlying growth remains very strong, driven by share gains and client wins. Overall, Services revenues were up 16% for the full year despite the impact of the Argentine devaluation. In TTS, cross-border transactions were up 15% and AUC/AUA in Securities Services were up by close to $3 trillion for the year. In Markets, our Fixed Income results were disappointing as we saw a significant slowdown in December particularly in Rates and FX. Markets was also impacted by the Argentine devaluation. This franchise is well-positioned with our corporate clients and we continue to take actions to improve returns, whether by redeploying capital to high-return We had a decent quarter in Equities, particularly in derivatives, and saw growth in prime balances, an area we have been focusing on. While activity picked up in the fourth quarter with revenues up 22%, overall Banking revenue continued to be impacted by a weak wallet globally. Investment Banking was up slightly for the year and we finished 2023 as the fifth leading franchise. We certainly aspire to be better. We are seeing improved confidence among CEOs and we like our pipeline, but of course the timing for a robust recovery is uncertain. The share gains we have made in areas such as healthcare put us in a good position when this business turns more decisively. While investment activity in Asia rebounded with quarterly revenues up 21%, and Wealth at Work up 18% where it needs to be. Andy is off to a fast start. In addition to resetting the expense base and ensuring the right utilization of our balance sheet, he is tightening our focus to build fee-based revenue streams and investment AUM. With $100 trillion in new wealth to be created by 2030, mainly in North America and Asia, and with our clients holding $5.4 trillion away from us, we have an important ability here to drive growth and returns to where they should be. USPB was a bright spot with every product up double-digits in the quarter compared to last year, including Retail Banking which benefitted from a rebound in mortgage origination. New and refreshed products have increased customer engagement as we see the benefits of the investments we have made. In Cards, IEB and ANR continued their growth, reflecting a more balanced lend vs spend mix and falling payment rates. As expected, loss rates are now back to pre-pandemic levels driven by customers in the lower FICO bands. In terms of the full year, in 2023, we grew revenues ex-divestitures by 4%, although the Argentine devaluation essentially prevented us from reaching the $78 billion revenue mark. We met our full-year expense guidance and we increased our CET1 ratio to 13.3% during the year. We grew our Tangible Book Value per share by 6% to $86.19 and returned $6 billion in capital to our shareholders in the form of common dividends and share buybacks. We remain committed to continuing to return capital to investors through both of these channels. As I reflect on the year, I also want to note that we were a source of strength for the system and clients during a volatile period for the banking sector and geopolitically. And I am very proud of how our people around the world performed during challenging times. 2024 looks to be similar to 2023 in terms of the macro environment with moderating rates and inflation. We expect to see growth slowing globally, with the U.S. well positioned to withstand a run-of-the-mill recession should one materialize. With a strong balance sheet, ample liquidity and diligent risk management, we are well positioned to support our clients through whatever environment comes to pass. Moreover, we think environments like these play to our strengths. Given how far we are down the path of our simplification and divestures, 2024 will be a turning point as we will be able to completely focus on the performance of our five businesses and our Transformation. I recognize the importance of this year and am highly confident we will see the benefits of the actions we have taken through the momentum of our businesses. Backed by investments in key products, we believe we can continue to grow revenues ex-divestitures by 4 to 5% over the medium term. Overall, we remain confident in our ability to adapt to the evolving capital and macro environments to reach our medium-term return targets and return capital to our shareholders, whilst continuing the investments needed in our transformation. With that, I would like to turn it over to Mark and then we would be delighted, as always, to take your questions.","billion, , revenue, liquidity, million, trillion, cet1",yes,Yes,cet1,No,,Yes,reserve build,No,,No,,Yes,"federal reserve, fdic",No,,Yes,cet1 ratio
2023,Q4,Mark Mason,"Thanks, Jane and good morning, everyone. I am going to start with the fourth quarter and full-year firmwide financial results, focusing on year-over-year our medium-term return target. The presentation of our results reflects the changes we have made in conjunction with our organizational simplification including reporting Legacy Franchises and Corporate/Other in All Other. However, before I go into the results, let me walk you through some of the notable items that impacted the quarter that were included in the 8K we recently filed. At the top right of slide 7, we show these items on a pre-tax basis. The FDIC special assessment of approximately $1.7 billion related to the regional bank failures in March. This impacted expenses in All Other. A restructuring charge of approximately $780 million related to actions associated with our organizational simplification, which will drive headcount reductions and future savings over the medium term, impacted expenses in All Other. The impact of the currency devaluation in Argentina of approximately $880 million. This was recorded in non-interest revenue across Services, Markets and Banking and you can see the impact by business in the appendix of the presentation. While we did have an adverse impact from the Argentina devaluation this quarter, we also benefitted from high interest rates, earning approximately $250 million of NII on the net investment in the quarter, given the hyperinflationary environment. And a reserve build of $1.3 billion related to increases in transfer risk associated with exposures to Russia and Argentina as described in the 8K. This impact is mostly included in other provisions in cost of credit and spans multiple businesses due to their globality. The combination of these items negatively impacted diluted EPS by approximately $2.00 and RoTCE by approximately 920 basis points. Now turning to the left side of the slide, where we show our financial results for the full firm. In the fourth quarter, we reported a net loss of $1.8 billion and a net loss per share of $1.16 on $17.4 billion of revenues. Excluding the notable items, diluted EPS would have been $0.84 with an RoTCE of 4.1% for the quarter. In the quarter, total revenues decreased by 3% on a reported basis. Excluding divestiture-related impacts and the impact of the Argentina devaluation, revenues increased 2%, driven by strength across Services, USPB, and Investment Banking, partially offset by lower revenues in Markets and Wealth and the revenue reduction from the closed exits and wind-downs. Turning to expenses, we reported expenses of $16.0 billion, which include the FDIC special assessment and modest divestiture-related costs. Excluding these items, expenses increased 10% to $14.2 billion, largely driven by the restructuring charge I just mentioned. Cost of credit was approximately $3.5 billion. Excluding the reserve build for transfer risk, cost of credit was primarily driven by Card net credit losses, which are now at pre-covid levels, as well as ACL builds for new card volumes. At the end of the quarter, we had nearly $22 billion in total reserves with a reserve-to-funded loans ratio of approximately 2.7%. And on a full-year basis, we delivered $9.2 billion of net income and an RoTCE of 4.9%. Adjusting for the notable items, net income was approximately $13.1 billion with an RoTCE of 7.3%. On slide 8, we show full year revenue trends by business from 2021 to 2023. It is important to highlight that in conjunction with the change to align with our new financial reporting structure, we moved the majority of the Financing & Securitization business from Banking to Markets. We also implemented a revenue sharing arrangement within Banking, and between Banking, Services and Markets to reflect the benefit the businesses get from our relationship-based lending. These changes are now reflected in our results and our historical financials. Now looking at the full year numbers. Services had a record year with revenues of $18.1 billion, up 16%, benefiting from both rates and business actions, new client wins and deepening with existing clients, partially offset by the Argentina devaluation. Markets revenues decreased 6% to $18.9 billion, largely driven by lower volatility and a significant slowdown in December. The Markets business was also impacted by the Argentina devaluation. Banking revenues decreased 15% to $4.6 billion, primarily driven by the mark-to-market on loan hedges, as well as a decrease in corporate lending. Investment Banking revenues were relatively flat for the year as we gained share amidst a declining wallet. Corporate Lending revenues were down 4%, excluding mark-to market on loan hedges. Wealth revenues decreased 5% to $7.1 billion, primarily due to the deposit mix shift towards higher yielding products which drove lower deposit spreads. USPB revenues increased 14% to $19.2 billion, primarily driven by growth in cards balances as we continue to see the benefit of our investments in digital acquisitions and customer engagement. Total revenues excluding divestitures came in at $77.1 billion, below our guidance of $78-79 billion for the year largely due to the impact of the Argentina devaluation, softer Markets performance, particularly in December and losses on loan hedges. However, NII ex-Markets came in at $47.6 billion, in line with our guidance. Despite the challenging environment and the impact of the Argentina devaluation, we grew firmwide revenues by an approximately 4% ex-divestitures, in line with our investor day target, demonstrating the benefit of our On slide 9, we show full year expense trends from 2021 to 2023. Excluding the FDIC special assessment and divestiture-related impacts, full-year expenses were $54.3 billion for 2023, in line with our guidance. As I mentioned, this includes roughly $780 million of restructuring costs associated with our organizational simplification and additional severance costs of approximately $730 million, which included actions to address stranded costs and start to right size the businesses. Relative to the prior year, expense growth continued to be driven by Transformation and business-led investments, volume-related expenses and other investments in risk and controls and technology, partially offset by productivity savings and a reduction in expenses in Legacy Franchises, within All Other. Over the performance of the firm but also the businesses. On slide 10, we show the components of our transformation and technology spend from 2021 to 2023. Over the past three years, we have invested significantly in our infrastructure, platforms, applications, processes and data. And as you can see in the bar chart, at the top of the slide, roughly 30% of our Transformation investments over the last three years were in technology, with the remainder related to non-tech employees and consultants. e seen a shift from consulting expenses to technology and compensation as we have gotten deeper into the execution of our Transformation And you should expect to see this trend continue In total, we invested over $12 billion in technology in 2023. Beyond transformation, our technology investments are also focused on digital innovation, new product development, client experience enhancements and areas that support our infrastructure like cloud and cyber. On slide 11, we show key consumer and corporate credit metrics. Across Branded Cards and Retail Services approximately 80% of our card loans are to consumers with FICO scores of 680 or higher. And across both portfolios, NCL rates have reached pre-covid levels but we continue to be well reserved with a reserve to funded loan ratio of 7.7%. In our Corporate portfolio, the majority of our exposure is investment grade which is reflected in our low level of non-accrual loans, at 63 basis points of total corporate loans. We feel good about the quality and mix of our portfolio and are well reserved for the current environment. network and the broader institutional client relationships we hold, as well as the strength of our financial profile in Argentina. As it relates to Russia, we have also included a slide in the appendix. You will see that the reserves for transfer risk that we have taken have significantly reduced our net investment and therefore our risk of loss related to Russia. On slide 12, we show our summary balance sheet and key capital and liquidity metrics. We maintain a very strong $2.4 trillion balance sheet which is funded in part by a well-diversified $1.3 trillion deposit base which is deployed into high-quality, diversified assets. The majority of our deposits, $801 billion, are institutional and operational in nature and span across 90 countries and are complemented by $426 billion of U.S. Personal Banking and Wealth deposits. We have approximately $561 billion of HQLA and approximately $690 billion of loans and we maintain total liquidity resources of $965 billion. Our LCR decreased modestly to 116%. And our tangible book value per share was $86.19, up 6%. On the bottom left corner of the slide, we show a full year CET1 walk to provide more detail on the drivers in 2023. First, we generated $8.0 billion of net income to common, which added 70 basis points. Second, we returned $6.1 billion in the form of common dividends and share repurchases, which drove a reduction of about 53 basis points. Third, we benefitted from the impact of lower rates on our AFS investment portfolio, which drove an increase of 20 basis points. And finally, the remaining 3 basis points was largely driven by higher RWA, partially offset by capital releases from the exit markets. We ended the quarter with a 13.3% CET1 capital ratio, approximately 100 basis points above our regulatory capital requirement of 12.3%. As you can see, we have grown our CET1 ratio by approximately 30 basis points over the course of the year while returning over $6 billion to shareholders in common dividends and repurchases. Before I take you through each business, as Jane mentioned, we are not satisfied with the performance and returns of our businesses and therefore we are laser focused on executing against our strategy, simplifying the organization and right sizing the expense base. As a reminder the investments that we have been making have impacted each of the businesses as you will see in the next few slides. So now turning to slide 13, where we show the results for Services for the fourth quarter and the full year. Revenues were up 6% this quarter, largely driven by NII across TTS and Securities Services, partially offset by NIR driven by the Argentina devaluation. Services non-interest revenues were up 20% excluding the impact of the Argentina devaluation. Expenses increased 9%, primarily driven by continued investments in technology, product innovation and client experience. Cost of credit was $646 million, driven by a reserve build of approximately $652 million, primarily associated with transfer risk in Russia and Argentina. Net income decreased to $776 million, as higher revenues were more than offset by higher cost of credit and higher expenses. Average loans were up 6%, primarily driven by strong demand for working capital loans in TTS, both in North America and internationally. Average deposits were down 3% as the impact of quantitative tightening more than offset new client acquisitions and deepening with existing clients, however sequentially, deposits were up 1%. Services delivered an RoTCE of 13.4% for the quarter. And for the full year, Services delivered an RoTCE of 20% on $18.1 billion of revenues. On slide 14, we show the results for Markets for the fourth quarter and the full year. Markets revenues were down 19%, versus a strong quarter last year, driven by a decline in fixed income and the impact of the devaluation, partially offset by an increase in equities. Fixed Income revenues decreased by 25%, largely driven by rates and currencies on lower volatility and a significant slowdown in December as well as the impact of devaluation. However, we saw good underlying momentum in equities, with revenues up 9%, driven by gains across all products. And we continued to grow prime balances while making solid progress on our revenue-to-RWA target. Expenses increased 8%, driven by investments in transformation and risk and controls and volume related costs, partially offset by productivity savings. Cost of credit was $209 million, driven by a reserve build of approximately $179 million, primarily associated with the transfer risk in Russia and Argentina. Markets reported a net loss of $134 million, as revenues were more than offset by higher expenses and higher cost of credit. Average loans increased 4% to $115 billion, as we saw increased client demand for credit driving growth in warehouse lending. Average trading assets increased 18% to $391 billion, largely driven by treasuries and mortgage-backed securities, given the strong client activity in fixed income for much of the year. While it was a challenging quarter, Markets performed relatively well for the full year with revenue of $18.9 billion and an RoTCE of 7.4%, compared with very strong performance in the prior year. And we are focused on improving returns over time through a combination of revenue growth, expense discipline, and capital optimization. On slide 15, we show the results for Banking for the fourth quarter and the full year. Banking revenues increased 22%, driven by growth in investment banking fees and lower losses on loan hedges, partially offset by lower Corporate Lending revenue. Investment banking revenues increased 27% YoY, driven by DCM and Advisory due to improvements in market sentiment. In Advisory, we saw signs of strength across Technology, Healthcare and Energy, and we feel good about the strength of our pipeline. Corporate Lending revenues excluding mark-to-market on loan hedges decreased 26%, largely driven by lower revenue share from Investment Banking, Services and Markets. Expenses increased 37%, primarily driven by the absence of an operational loss reserve release in the prior year. Excluding the reserve release, expenses were roughly flat. Cost of credit was $185 million, driven by a reserve build associated with the transfer risk in Russia and Argentina. The NCL rate was 32 basis points of average loans and we ended the quarter with a reserve to funded loan ratio of 1.6%. Banking reported a net loss of $322 million as higher expenses and cost of credit more than offset higher revenues. RoTCE was negative 6.0% for the quarter. And for the full year, Banking reported an RoTCE of negative 0.2% on $4.6 billion of revenues. So clearly, we have more work to do on capitalize on the rebound in the market wallet. And that includes continuing to invest in key growth areas, upgrading talent in traditional sectors, and continuing to right size the business. On slide 16, we show the results for Wealth for the fourth quarter and the full year. Wealth revenues decreased 3%, driven by lower deposit spreads, partially offset by lower mortgage funding cost and higher -interest revenue, which was up 13% in the fourth quarter, driven by higher investment assets, increased client activity and market performance. Expenses were up 4%, primarily driven by investments in risk and controls and technology, partially offset by re-pacing strategic investments and tighter expense control as we begin to right size the expense base in the business. Wealth reported net income of $5 million, as revenues were mostly offset by higher expenses. Client balances increased 6%, primarily driven by higher client investment assets, partially offset by lower deposit balances. Average loans were flat, as we continued to optimize capital usage. Average deposits decreased 2%, reflecting the continued mix shift of deposits to higher-yielding investments on Client investment assets were up 12%, driven by new acquisitions and the benefit from higher market valuations. good momentum in net new assets, which more than doubled to $16 billion for the quarter. For the full year, we added an estimated $21 billion in net new assets. RoTCE was 0.1% for the quarter. And for the full year, RoTCE was 2.6% on $7.1 billion of revenues. Looking ahead, strategy to drive investment revenue with an eye toward right sizing the expense base. We will wind down non-core initiatives, exit less productive performers and enhance discipline across every expense line. On slide 17, we show the results for US Personal Banking for the fourth quarter and the full year. US Personal Banking revenues increased 12%. Branded Cards revenues increased 10%, driven by higher net interest margin and interest-earning balance growth of 13%. And we continue to see healthy growth in new account acquisitions, up 8% and spend volumes up 3%. Retail Services revenues increased 15%, also driven by higher net interest margin and interest-earning balance growth of 11%, as well as lower partner payments due to higher net credit losses. Retail Banking revenues increased 15%, driven by higher deposit spreads, loan growth and improved mortgage margins. Expenses decreased 1%, as higher expenses to support lending programs and client engagement, as well as the rollout of Simplified Banking were offset by lower non-volume related expenses. Cost of credit of $2.1 billion increased 20%, driven by higher NCLs, partially offset by a lower ACL build. Net income increased to $201 million, driven by higher revenues, partially offset by higher cost of credit. Average deposits decreased 5%, driven by the transfer of relationships and the associated deposits to our Wealth business. We continued to make progress against our digital strategy, with digital deposits up 14% and active digital users increasing 6%. RoTCE for the quarter was 3.6%. And for the full year, US Personal Banking delivered an ROTCE of 8.3% on $19.2 billion of revenue. Here again, we are focused on improving the return profile of the business, managing through this part of the credit cycle and continuing to make progress in Retail Banking will be key. On slide 18, we show results for All Other on a managed basis, which includes Corporate Other and Legacy Franchises and excludes divestiture-related items. Revenues decreased 17%, driven by a decrease in NII of 29%, largely driven by the closed exits and wind-downs, partially offset by higher non-interest revenue. And expenses increased to $4.5 billion, driven by the FDIC special assessment and restructuring costs, partially offset by lower expenses in both wind-down and exit markets. Turning to slide 20, as we kick off 2024, the environment remains somewhat uncertain and Markets remains difficult to predict, but based on what we see today we expect revenues to be approximately $80 to $81 billion as shown on the left side of the slide. And on the right side of the slide, we list the key drivers. In TTS, we expect revenue growth to be driven by new client wins, deepening with our existing clients and continued momentum with Commercial Clients as we continue to leverage our global footprint and product innovations. In Securities Services, we have a very healthy pipeline and will continue to onboard assets under custody from new mandates, win new clients and deepen relationships with existing clients. In Investment Banking we anticipate a rebound in activity and to maintain our position as the wallet recovers. technology, to allow us to gain share. And we also expect a modest rebound in Wealth, as we execute on our refocused strategy with an eye towards growing investment fees, particularly with our existing clients. In USPB, we expect continued growth in cards balances driven by the investments we have been making as well as lower partner payments in retail services to continue to drive revenue growth. We also expect to continue to improve our retail branch performance. And as it relates to NII, excluding Markets, we expect net interest income to be down modestly as the volume growth we expect from loans and deposits is more than offset by lower US rates and the reduction from the closed exits and wind-downs. Turning to slide 21, we expect expenses to be approximately $53.5 to $53.8 billion, down from $54.3 billion, subject to volume-related expenses. The decrease in expenses will be driven by the benefits of our organizational simplification, a continued reduction from exit markets and wind-downs, and productivity savings, partially offset by investments in risk and controls and volume-related expenses. Embedded in this guidance includes an elevated level of severance, as well as additional potential costs related to the organizational simplification totaling approximately $700 million to $1 billion. This will contribute to reducing headcount over 2024 and the medium term, which we will discuss on the next slide. On slide 22, we show the drivers of headcount and expense reduction over the medium-term. discussed in the past, there are three drivers that will reduce our expenses. Organizational simplification including the reduction of management layers. Eliminating stranded costs as we take additional actions to reduce excess overhead in light of the exit markets. And realizing productivity savings from our investments in the transformation and technology. We expect the combination of these three drivers to reduce our headcount by a net 20 thousand, excluding Mexico, and generate a net run rate save of $2 to $2.5 billion over the medium term. This will underpin our path to $51 to $53 billion of expenses, subject to volume related expenses. Both the headcount and expense reduction will allow us to right size the firm and businesses to improve performance and returns. On slide 23, we show our outlook for U.S. Cards in 2024. In terms of credit performance, based on the above pre-COVID levels and peak in 2024. On a full-year basis for 2024, we expect the Branded Cards NCL rate to be in the range of 3.5% to 4.0% and the Retail Services NCL rate to be in the range of 5.75% to 6.25%. From an allowance perspective, we are reserved for a weighted 8-quarter average unemployment rate of almost 5.0%, which imbeds a downside scenario of approximately 6.8%. ACL builds in 2024 will primarily be a function of the volume growth that we see as well as changes in the macro scenarios and the probabilities associated with them. And we expect continued momentum in cards albeit more in line with mid-single digit loan growth. On slide 24, we summarize our medium-term targets. While a lot has changed in the macro environment since Investor Day, our strategy has not, and we are on a path to the 11-12% RoTCE in the medium term, driven by top line revenue growth and expense reductions. From a revenue perspective, we continue to expect a 4-5% revenue CAGR in the medium-term, including the ongoing reduction of revenue from the closing of the exits and the wind-downs. From an expense perspective, we are now on the path to lowering our expenses, beginning in 2024. From a credit perspective, we expect credit costs to be a function of portfolio mix, volumes and macro assumptions. And we are committed to returning capital to our shareholders and in fact expect to do modest buybacks in 1Q 2024. So, to wrap it up, while the world has changed significantly and the components have shifted since Investor Day, our strategy has not. And we are confident we are on the right path to deliver our 11-12% RoTCE in the medium term. With that, Jane and I will be happy to take your questions.","capital ratio, billion, , revenue, net income, liquidity, million, loan growth, trillion, net interest income, cet1",yes,Yes,"cet1, capital ratio",Yes,lcr,Yes,reserve build,No,,No,,Yes,fdic,No,,Yes,"cet1 ratio, lcr, net interest margin"
2023,Q4,"Question And Answer
Operator",Our first question will come from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q4,Mike Mayo,"Hi. I looked in detail at the earnings presentation, especially slide 4, and I think the question is, on many people's minds, I count 12 restructurings at Citigroup. And I count 12 restructurings that have failed at Citigroup. You might disagree with the number 12, It could be 5, it could be 8, it could be 12, it could be more, but I've not spoken to one person of any investor who would say that Citi has succeeded on its prior restructuring. So, the question is, why is this time different? Number one, who is this new and improved Citigroup. Number two, why aren't expenses down even move, especially when few people that I talk to think you'll hit your revenue target? And three, Jane, what is your conviction level of getting to that 11% to 12% RoTCE in 2025 or 2026? Thank you.",revenue,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q4,Jane Fraser,"Well, thank you very much indeed, Mike. I'll start with, who is Citi? Citi is, I'm delighted to say, finally simple. At Investor Day, I set out a vision to be the preeminent banking partner for clients with cross border needs. That vision was based on five core interconnected businesses. We set off on a deliberate path to get there, and over the last three years we've done so. Page 4 is who we are today. We are five interconnected businesses; no more, no less. We have our organization that now aligns with those five businesses, and this enables us to focus on two priorities. The first is improving the performance and the returns of those five core businesses, so that we can meet the medium-term RoTCE target we laid out. And the second is on addressing our regulatory issues through the transformation. And I would also be, I need to note that I fully recognize that 2024 is an inflection year, Mike. And I and the management team are accountable to deliver. And that you and our investors have the transparency you need to hold us accountable. So, why is this time different? Look, it's not lost on me that there's been many attempts in the past to change this firm. I and the management are fully committed to transforming this company for the long term and we are addressing the issues that have held us back in the past. And you've got proof points of the last three years where we've made a lot of tough decisions and we have put through a tremendous amount of change to get to the simple Citi that we are today. We completely reset our strategy. So, we now have a significantly more focused business and operating model. We've announced the most consequential set of changes to our organizational model, and frankly, from my perspective, more importantly, how we run the bank, since the financial crisis, aimed at simplifying the bank and increasing accountability. You've seen moved quickly. We're on track with our execution of this effort. And it will generate over $1 billion of run rate saves the end of the first quarter, purely from the organization efforts that we've put in that we announced in September. We've done this while investing and I think this is another difference. We've invested heavily in our transformation. And while that was catalyzed by our consent orders, these investments will ultimately deliver benefits from automation, from well governed data, from consolidated platforms. We also have made significant investments in our business to support the 4% to 5% revenue growth and to ensure client momentum. And those investments have helped us expand our product suite, invest in digital capabilities, automate our processes, capture synergies through the client organization. We've also brought in some incredible external talent in key strategic areas, including Andy, to lead Wealth. And we now have a good balance between experienced Citi people and external talent with fresh perspectives through multiple layers of the organization. So, we are doing things the right way, we're doing it for the long term and we're moving with urgency. We will need and are spending the money that we need to, to address our regulatory requirements, but that's already embedded in our path to the 11% to 12% RoTCE in the medium term. And this already feels like a different bank. We have more work to do. I recognize 2024 is a critical year, and as I said, the decks are much clearer now, so that we can focus on two imperatives: improving our business performance and executing the transformation. Neither is an entirely linear path as we've seen over the last three years. We all know that. We get we have to build our credibility. We're committed to doing so. And we are providing far more transparency around the business performance, so investors have a better sense of how we're doing. And I and my management team, to your final question, are fully accountable for getting this all done. We will. Mark, expenses?","billion, revenue",yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q4,Mark Mason,"Yeah, thanks, Jane. And why aren't expenses down more? I think to your point, Jane, we've been investing in the franchise both on the front-end, and importantly, on the transformation and the risk and controls. What I would point out is that, in 2023, we delivered expenses of $54.3 billion ex the FDIC charge. That is the guidance that we gave. But I also highlight that we also included $780 million associated with the restructuring charge. That is more than I had articulated in the way of guidance. So, the capacity that we created through our efforts through the year, we use that in a smart way. We use that to fund the org simplification cost, so that we can realize the savings down the line. And we're going to continue to manage our expenses in a disciplined and smart fashion. That means spending what we need to spend on the transformation and risk and controls, but driving greater efficiencies and productivities along the way to ensure we get to that 11% to 12%. And to your point, if revenues are to come down or come in lower than expected, we'll adjust the expenses accordingly.","billion, million",yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,Yes,fdic,No,,No,
2023,Q4,Operator,Thank you. Our next question comes from Glenn Schorr with Evercore. Your line is now open.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q4,Glenn Schorr,"Hi. Thanks very much. So, you're clearly making a lot of progress and I hate to like, ask this question too early, but I think it is important. Your expense guidance is good, your revenue guide is good, and you have your arms around the expenses. The question I have is, how do you think about balancing that near term profitability improvement that we all want desperately with making sure you do make the right investments? Because if you look around the world there's a lot of places to grow, whether it be a branch network, or the wealth management aspirations that you have, or the digital investments. So, how do we know that all the right future investments are being made while you extract costs in all the good ways that you've been doing?",revenue,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q4,Mark Mason,"Yeah, thanks, Glenn. I guess, I'll start, and Jane, feel free to add in on it. Look, it is a balancing act, right, and we do look at each of our five core businesses. We obviously are clear on the strategy, but where's the growth? Where are the return opportunities associated with them? And how do we ensure we're deploying resources after them in order to deliver for the client and deliver on those returns over time? We have to juxtapose that against the required investment to modernize our operations and we're making those trade-offs on a regular basis. But importantly, when we do invest to capture those growth opportunities, we're trying to be agile about it, which means if those opportunities don't play out in the way we're expecting because the cycle just doesn't mature or materialize in that fashion, we've got to be disciplined enough to dial them back, and that's what you've seen over the past year plus, is that we've been investing in the business. Where we didn't see the upside that we anticipated, we dialed back that spend, right, and that's the type of iterative process, if you will, Glenn, that we're putting in place to ensure that on the other side of this, we're still positioned to capture growth. Investment Banking, for example, we have invested in healthcare, in technology, building out to prepare ourselves for when that market rebounds. We feel good about that. We've done similar things in the way of our Wealth business. We're investing heavily in our TTS franchise to ensure we can remain competitive there, so it's that type of discipline that's required. It is sometimes a trade-off, but it's one that we've been very focused on being smart about.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q4,Glenn Schorr,"I appreciate that. Maybe a quickie on Services. Obviously, up 16% and a record is great. I don't know if you've dimensionalized how much was rate versus new business, but you have good core business momentum and a pipeline of won, but not yet funded. So I guess the question is, where can Services be over, let's say, the next two years in terms of growth, while rates come down, yet your businesses is winning new wins?",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q4,Mark Mason,"Yeah, sure. You want me to, sure.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q4,Jane Fraser,"Yeah and I'll jump in, too. Let's maybe start with TTS. When we think about the performance of TTS, which, as we say, the growth this year up 19% ex-Argentina, came from a combination of both rates and the strong business actions we've taken. And you can see that in the different drivers. Cross-border was up 23%, commercial cards up 8%. In terms of the growth prospects, we've generated 22% in average revenue growth, from 21 to 23, well ahead of the Investor Day guidance we had of high-single digits. That was not just because of the rate cycle. It obviously helped. And we certainly expect to grow revenues at mid-single digit now as we lap the prior periods that benefited from those rate increases, and that's going to come from a few different areas. One, the focus on our fee strategy, where we're capitalizing on strong client engagement, market-leading client solutions, and we're delivering on a lot of the different growth initiatives that we've been investing in across all our client segments. We'll continue optimizing our deposit book and bringing in high-quality deposits. And in a lower rate environment, GDP is typically higher, so you'd expect to see some higher growth in our capital-efficient payment volumes. You'll see us continuing to acquire new clients and deepen relationships with existing clients. And I'd point to our confidence here, 27% increase in our new client acquisition this year and a sustained win/loss ratio of 82% on new deals, and that was across different client segments. And revenues from these clients just continues to ramp up, as we expand across the different geographies and product suites with them. And you'll also continue to see us investing in the infrastructure and platforms we've been doing, launching new innovative products. And we're seeing momentum from some of the things we've recently done: Citi Token Services, Payment Express, 24/7 Clearing, et cetera. So I think, the main takeaway from TTS is that we'll continue to invest in it. We expect to see strong client momentum. We've been getting consistently good client feedback regarding our capabilities, so we expect to see good global growth that will certainly help as the rate cycle comes down. And it is a crown jewel for a reason. And then, just quickly on Securities Services. I think where we're seeing, we mentioned, we've got a number of marquee wins there across all the client segments. That pipeline is both investors and issuers. And one of the core strategies that Okan put in place was to grow share with the US-based asset managers. We were at 2.6% share in 2020; we're now at 4.3%. And a lot of the growth in the pipeline has been coming, not only from our global network names, but also from the marquee players in the US asset manager space. I think that's our ability to connect our capabilities that gives these players huge efficiencies for our clients. Mark, anything I've missed there? You know I love this business.",revenue,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q4,Mark Mason,"As you should rightfully so, high-returning business, great growth prospects. To answer one of your questions, Glenn, about half of the NII growth, we could attribute to interest rates. And about half, I'd say, is business action, so us working with the clients to drive that momentum. And then, if you think about the noninterest revenue, for Services, they're up about 20% in the quarter year-over-year if you exclude the impact of the Argentina devaluation, and up 7% on a full year basis. And so, good momentum in the noninterest revenue growth as well.",revenue,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q4,Operator,Our next question comes from John McDonald with Autonomous Research. Your line is now open.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q4,John Mcdonald,"Hi good morning. Mark, was hoping to ask you, how are you thinking about the pacing of capital build? Obviously, the Basel III proposals are out there, but they could change, of course. Even if they don't change, you have a couple of years to leg into those with the phase-ins and perhaps some mitigation opportunities. How should we think about you kind of building capital, given all those variables and the ability to buy back some stock along the way as you mentioned earlier?",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,Yes,basel iii,No,
2023,Q4,Mark Mason,"Sure, so look, John, obviously the Basel III proposal's still out there and under discussion. We've been very vocal about the potential impact of that. We've also been very disciplined about how we've been managing our capital. We've built that over 30 basis points over the course of the year. You've seen us actively manage that through the year, and we're going to continue to do that. We obviously generate earnings that contribute to that. We want to continue to drive growth across the business. We're trading at a 0.5 times book, where we can, we want to buy back as much as we can in shares. And we try to be disciplined about that over the past couple of quarters, doing that as a modest level. You heard me say, we're going to do that again this quarter at a modest level, but we have to be thoughtful about what those headwinds might look like. And we're actively working what mitigation actions we have to put in place, should it turn out closer to the way the current proposal sits. So, it's an ongoing active management that tries to balance servicing our client needs, with, obviously, holding a responsible amount of capital in light of the uncertainty that's out there, and with an eye towards buybacks where we can do that.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,Yes,basel iii,No,
2023,Q4,John Mcdonald,"Okay. And just as an expense follow-up, I wasn't clear. Has the transformation spend peaked, when you think about what you'll spend on transformation this year versus last year? And are the transformation benefits starting to kick in at this point?",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q4,Mark Mason,"Yeah. So to be clear, we're going to continue to spend whatever we need to spend on the transformation and on risk and controls. And so, we did see a tick up this year. We've got a plan for 2024, and if we've got to spend a bit more than we spent this year, we're going to spend more. That's what the plan calls for, and so that's what we'll do. That's inside of the number that I've given you for guidance, all right. And so, that's important for us. I think it will drive, obviously, operational improvement and saves down the line. It is part of the $2 billion to $2.5 billion, but that is the early stage, if you will, of the transformation spend paying back. I think as we talked about at Investor Day, frankly, we'll continue to see expense benefits beyond the medium term from some of this transformation investment that we've been making. And so, I would think of the medium term as the start of the benefits that we'll see from the investments we've been making in transformation and risk and controls.",billion,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q4,Jane Fraser,"Yeah. I think, Mark, you're spot on. So we'll continue making the investments we need to in the transformation. It's a multi-year journey, as we've always been clear around this, ultimately, with benefits to the shareholders. And more of the expense saves that we've been talking about are, I'd separate out transformation from sort of the operating expense base of our businesses, which we want to make sure is as productive and as effective as possible. And the types of benefits we're seeing. This is the second year in a row that we've retired 6% of our legacy platform base. And you've heard me talking about moving 20 of our cash equity platforms on to 1, 6 reporting ledgers on to 1, 11 sanctioned platforms on to 1. So we start seeing some of the benefits of those come in. Other things, we automated independent price verification for 90% of our prioritized fixed income and equity securities. That's reduced manual controls. That's improved valuation consistency. That's also had an impact on the efficiency of the business. We've loaded 98% of our prioritized wholesale and consumer data into two authorized repositories. That will also begin to start having some benefits for us. So there is a cumulative effect that is beginning to build now from all the work we've done, but it will take some time to really kick into the, as Mark said, when you really feel it, is a few years out. But we'll keep giving you the proof points of things as we're going, so it's not a just trust us that i s coming, you'll begin to see it build.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q4,Operator,Our next question will come from Jim Mitchell with Seaport Global. Your line is now open.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q4,Jim Mitchell,"Hey, good afternoon. Mark, maybe just to follow up on the expense, slide 22, where you talk about $2 billion to $2.5 billion of expense saves. I guess I'm struggling with the numbers there. I think if you look at exit and wind- down markets, you're probably close to $2 billion in numbers there. And maybe the stranded costs, you can't get all of that out. You're doing about severance is $700 million to $1 billion in 2024. So doesn't seem like there's a ton of actual cost saves in that number. And just maybe I'm wrong, if you could just kind of walk me through the numbers embedded in there and if there's, you've kind of eluded to more to come beyond the intermediate term.","billion, million",no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q4,Mark Mason,"Yeah, I think the thing I'd point out to you is a couple things. One, obviously, we're forecasting revenue growth over this period of time. And so, there's going to be volume-related expenses associated with that. The second thing I'd point out, as I just mentioned to the prior question, is that we're continuing to invest in risk and controls and in the transformation over this period of time. And so, what you see is there's an increase in expenses associated with at least those two things. And that's offset by the savings that we're starting to generate, particularly from the org simplification that Jane has talked about, as well as from the stranded cost reduction that will continue to play out, as well as from some of the rightsizing of businesses that we've referenced in some of the prepared remarks. And so, important to think about, there are headwinds and tailwinds that kind of net down to this $2 billion to $2.5 billion. And then the final point that I'd make is if I look at this medium-term number of $51 billion to $53 billion that still has Mexico in it and one of the other pages we'd point to, expenses around Mexico. But because of where we are, we'll be in the IPO process, that's still going to be part of this expense base, and so you can't lose sight of that.","billion, revenue",yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q4,Jim Mitchell,"Well, that's an important clarification that the $2 billion to $2.5 billion includes revenue related volume growth, so that's helpful. And then, just maybe the other, on the slides talking about revenue targets. One of the big numbers not talked about was Markets. How are you thinking, volatility has come in, macro picture s getting better, maybe that mutes volatility, how do you think about that business in 2024 as it relates to your guidance?","billion, revenue",no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q4,Mark Mason,"As you know, it's a tough business to forecast, certainly, for a full year, and in some instances for a quarter, and so, we've basically kind of backed that out but we assume markets kind of flat to modestly down, but we've backed it out, and it's roughly flat. Not of the $80 billion to $81 billion, right, you see the guidance of NIR ex- Markets and NII ex-Markets, so in the $80 billion to $81 billion, we've assumed it roughly flat.",billion,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q4,Jim Mitchell,"Okay, great. Thank you.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q4,Operator,Our next question will come from Ebrahim Poonawala with Bank of America. Your line is now open.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q4,Ebrahim Poonawala,"Morning, afternoon, Jane. Just wanted to follow up on something I think Mark said at the end of his very first response around, it's very hard in my seat to figure out whether you're going to grow revenues or shrink revenues given the macro. Should we take it based on what you've said today as we look into 2026 getting to that 11% RoTCE, if for whatever reason, revenue falls short and you feel good about the expense flex to mitigate that headwind?",revenue,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q4,Jane Fraser,"It's Jane, obviously. I want to just jump in on one bit, which is we are committed and we're very confident around the 4% to 5% revenue growth rate, so there isn't any backing away from that number. And that's in various macro environments, et cetera. And as we look across the different businesses, and the projections we have, we're confident around that. Obviously, if there's a very adverse macro environment, et cetera, we've got other levers we can take, but Mark, let me pass it to you.",revenue,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q4,Mark Mason,"And by no means was I trying to suggest that we weren't confident in the forecast for the top line. If you think about the strategy and the strength of those five core businesses, we've got a lot of conviction around that. With that said, as you point out, Jane, under a circumstance where that doesn't play out, there are obviously volume-related incentive comp expenses and the like that would naturally come down. We'd ensure that they came down with the revenue decline or shortfall. And then we'd recalibrate other spend, other investments, spend not related to risk and controls and transformation, but other investments across the platform, we'd recalibrate accordingly.",revenue,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q4,Ebrahim Poonawala,"Well said. Just what I needed. And one quick question. As we think about rightsizing the Markets business, there have been headlines around the muni and the distressed business that you've gotten out. Is there a risk where the Markets business becomes too small and you lag the scale to be sort of efficient and relevant in certain, or just across the breadth of, be it, fixed income or equities? Just if you can talk about that. Thank you.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q4,Jane Fraser,"The short answer is no. If you think about our Markets business, we have four businesses, each of which are around sort of $4 billion or so in size. You have our global FX network, where we're typically number one in any year, just given the strength, and particularly, the corporate client base we've set off. Rates, typically top three. Together, these are two of the largest macro pools within FICC. In terms of the spread products, we've been putting our financing and securitization business as part of our simplification, fully within Markets, so that we've created a unified, scaled spreads product business. And then finally, equities, where we're focused on improving our prime offering, building balances. We still have a way to go obviously in that. Prime balances we're pleased they were nicely up this year, driven by client momentum. And we're a leading equities derivative franchise. So, you do have these four core businesses. And I'd go back to our big point of differentiation and why we feel we're well-positioned. We have a very differentiated corporate client base and very strong partnerships between our core Markets franchise, TTS, and Banking and Securities Services, and that helps us in FX, in commodities and in rates around the world. So, Markets is important both in terms of its leadership, but also, how it fits into the strengths that we have from this simpler Citi of those five core interconnected businesses. We've demonstrated solid returns in the past. I think a lot of the actions we've been taking will help drive returns in the future. And you should be getting confidence when you see the discipline we're putting on to RWA, 5.3%, getting close that target, we said at Investor Day. We're moving that up to 6%. The exits we've got of nonstrategic businesses shows our focus on efficiency. And we've also been doing some good investments in our technology, and that's getting us into a good place there. So, I think, don't be concerned about the shrinking. We're just making sure that it really plays to our strengths and we optimize the returns.",billion,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q4,Operator,Our next question will come from Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Your line is now open.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q4,Gerard Cassidy,"Good afternoon, Mark, Jane. Mark, can you share with us, in your revenue guide, in the net interest income, I know you mentioned it's going to be lower and part of it is due to lower interest rates. Some of your peers have come out with their guides using the forward curve in their net interest income forecast which includes the Fed in our country, six cuts. Can you give us some color what kind of rate environment, I know you said lower rates, but any insights around that guide?","revenue, net interest income",no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q4,Mark Mason,"Yeah, I think what I'd point you to is in the range of the $80 billion to $81 billion, we're assuming three to six cuts, right. You've got a range there and the reason I described it like that is that, if you think about our IRE, as we've shown it in the Qs before, we're positioned such that, with 100 basis point move, parallel shift in rate across the curve, the US dollar impact would only be a couple hundred million dollars, all right, and so, to the negative, obviously, but it's a couple hundred million dollars. And so as we think about that forecast, and as I mentioned, NII being down a bit, that covers kind of three to six cuts over the course of 2024, likely back-loaded, but that's what's in there.",billion,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q4,Gerard Cassidy,"Very good, I appreciate that. And then, Jane, more of a qualitative question rather than quantitative, but obviously, there's numerous moving parts of the strategies that you guys are executing on, exiting businesses, downsizing businesses. Especially on the downsizing, I think you guys mentioned, the head count of about 20,000 coming down. How do you keep the morale of the organization elevated when you have these types of tough decisions that you all have to make?",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q4,Jane Fraser,"Yes. Well, we've also got areas which are growing, so that does help, too. We have a diversified portfolio here. I think we're very mindful of, that there is a human impact of the decisions that we're making. We're trying to be as transparent with our people, as we are with our investors about what we need to do, why we're doing it, what to expect and laying that out so people understand the logic behind the decisions, and then they understand what the decisions are as quickly as they can. I think that's the most humane way to do this.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q4,Operator,Our next question comes from Erika Najarian with UBS. Your line is now open.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q4,Erika Najarian,"Hi. I'm sorry to prolong the call. Thank you for all your color. Just one more question. Jane, when will you feel comfortable giving us a buyback outlook that's beyond just fourth quarter? I know you still have a little bit of ways to go, but you do have 100 basis point buffer to your minimum. And I know Basel III endgame is still out there, and I'm sure that reducing risk just doesn't mean expenses, but also reducing your or being mindful of your RWA footprint. And given where your stock is relative to book, when will you be more comfortable about giving sort of a longer-term outlook that was underpinning your RoTCE target with regards to the buyback?",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,Yes,basel iii,No,
2023,Q4,Jane Fraser,"Erika, it's a great question. It's one I ask myself every morning when I get up, because given where we trade, the value for our shareholders of buybacks is enormous. And Mark and I are very committed to doing so. We also know that we're building our credibility. And I don't want to say things that we're not going to deliver against, although we're going to have to change. I think it's one of the values that we're really trying to adhere to very strongly. And with the NPR, I think we'll get a better sense about this soon. The comment period just got extended, and we want to see what that is. I think you've all heard us at the Senate banking hearings with our concerns about it. I very much hope that it is either completely revised or very materially, so it doesn't have a negative impact on the economy and the US banking system competitiveness, the move for more business to the shadow banks, which I think has got to a point, which is not healthy. So, we're going to wait and see where that comes out before we give it to you, but I would be asking exactly the same question in your shoes as well.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q4,Erika Najarian,"Thank you, Jane. I think that it was very helpful that you said on this public forum where you're trying to build credibility, because as I think about what long-only investors have been dying to see from Citi in terms of the previous leadership was that sort of awareness. And I think just having that awareness recognition will be very important to investors, so thank you.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q4,Jane Fraser,Thank you.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q4,Operator,"Our next question will come from Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open. Hi. I want to follow up on the Russian exposure on page 34. It looks like you guys have taken a really good whack on the net investment. And you also highlighted how the CTA would be capital neutral, even if you did have to write that down. But what about the remaining exposure? And just like how prime are you responsible for some of these unremittable corporate derivatives? I think a lot of us don't understand that type of exposure. And is there risk to you going forward, or could you hopefully clear it back from the outside exposure going forward?",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q4,Jane Fraser,"Yeah, actually, I also want to kind of take a bigger picture answer to that before I turn it to Mark. Because I would have thought that's a question that is on everybody's minds, particularly given the firm's overall low level of returns and our headline numbers this quarter about what we've been doing with Russia and Argentina, the sort of bigger strategic question behind it, and then we'll get to your specifics on the Russia front. If you think about Citi, we have a differentiated global business model, and that means we're committed to the countries in which our multinational clients operate over the long run. So, that means we hold long-term capital in those countries, upon which we generate solid returns through the cycle. And let me just point to our leading Services and FX businesses are the heart of that network, and they're generating double-digits, as you can see. With that footprint comes a set of risks. So, I think of it in terms of credit, currency, transferability of capital. And we've proven our ability to manage those risks consistently over a long period of time. And with respect to the Q4 currency and transfer items, while the timing was unknown and we've highlighted those risks in our disclosures for a couple of years, I'd say, Russia is rather unique. It's a war, and for us, a highly unusual liquidation. We've navigated it very well. We've executed our wind-down in an orderly way with very low losses for our clients and very low losses for us. Our remaining net assets are now 100% reserved against. And I think similarly, if I just touch on Argentina for a minute, because I'm sure, folks have got a few questions on that. Similarly, over the last several years, we've de-risked our business model there. We don't have a consumer bank, so we've really reduced down our emerging markets exposures to just our institutional presence, focused on the multinational clients, you've heard us talk about that, and select high-grade local clients. If you look at Argentina, it's a very good business for us over the cycle. And even after the impacts of Q4, we had less than $5 million in credit losses in Argentina over a 10-year period. That's remarkable, $5 million over 10 years. In terms of the currency risk, we all have to book revenues, the official rate versus the parallel market rate. We are able to partially but not fully hedge the exposure, but we would certainly always take economic decisions on the business we do and did mindful of likely devaluations and capital controls. And the reserve is a reserve. It centers on the ability to convert and transfer capital as per US banking laws, so I just want to put part of things at this quarter into that context. We have a global business model. It's heavily focused on high-grade multinational clients. Our track record for managing the various risks associated with our global network has been very strong. And I think you're seeing us with a very conservative and reserved profile. Mark, what would you add?",million,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q4,Mark Mason,"Yeah, very quickly on the Russia point. As you know and as the slide points out, we've continued to bring our exposure down there. It's down to $6.5 billion, it's down 13% from the previous year and a third from 2021. We've brought down the consumer loans, the consumer deposits in a significant way there. And essentially, what's left is that we have a custody business and we're holding corporate dividends that are our clients' proceeds we re unable to pay those out by law, by regulation, and so we have to hold those and so that's what's being referenced in the slide when we say unremittable Russia corporate dividends. And so, that is not a risk of loss for us, but we're unable to kind of clear those because of the state of play in Russia at this stage. Okay, that was clear. And then, just separately in credit cards. You and a lot of your peers expect losses to go up from here, but most of you are saying, they're going to peak at this year, including you. Just what gives you confidence that the card losses will peak this year is it just getting back to that a little bit of a normalized level? Is it some tightening that you've done? What's driving that confidence, looking out this year? Because you're probably seeing a step-up coming still, right?",billion,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q4,Mark Mason,"Sure ,there's a step-up coming. We gave a forecast on 2024 (sic), as you point out, to what the full-year estimate for NCLs will be for both Branded and for Retail Services. What I'd point out is, you can see actually on the slide how there was a dip in loss rates during the COVID period. And so to some extent, what we're seeing is kind of a catch up of those, as those portfolios go through a longer maturation than what you'd normally see in a cards portfolio. On top of that, we've been originating new card. You've noticed our acquisitions have grown, so we obviously have new card loans, and those are going through a much normal maturation period. And so, as we look at the early buckets and the delinquencies that are playing out, we've got a pretty good sense for when we would expect those to peak and at what level. And we think they'll peak inside of 2024, so that's captured in that average forecast that we've given. We haven't made material changes to our underwriting. However, there is mix evolution that happens. Transactors, we have a number of transactors that have kind of come on to our portfolio and are in the mix of our Branded portfolio as well. So, anyway, those are the drivers that give us confidence and inform the trajectory that we're talking about here.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q4,Operator,Our next question will come from Ryan Kenny with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q4,Ryan Kenny,"Hi. Thanks for taking my question. So, I have a question on quantitative tightening. Wondering if you have any early thoughts on how Citi's positioned if the Fed ends QT early? Is that a material catalyst for you, and would that help you hit your revenue targets even sooner?",revenue,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q4,Mark Mason,"Yeah. Again, I mean, when I think about our interest rate exposure, and for US dollar in particular, we showed it in our last Q, we'll show it in this Q. For a 100 basis point move in a parallel shift, we're looking at probably a negative $1.6 billion or so, but important to point out that the US dollar component of that is only a couple hundred million dollars. Similarly, if rates moved in the other way, positive of 100 basis points, there'd be a small movement as it relates to US dollar exposure. So our US dollar exposure is relatively neutral, again, assuming a static balance sheet, a parallel shift in the curve. And so, we're kind of neutral relative to rates moving in either direction and, therefore, the impact there.",billion,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q4,Ryan Kenny,"Then, there's a lot of optimism and debate around capital markets rebound. Are you seeing that? And can you help update us on Investment Banking pipeline across M&A, ECM, DCM?",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q4,Jane Fraser,"Yes. We certainly had a much more constructive market environment to the end of 2023. Interest rate spreads and volatility at lows for the year. Equity prices are high. And I think we view this as a helpful foundation for activity to accelerate in 2024, assuming the tailwinds persist. And speaking of our own pipeline, the breadth, the depth, the quality of it's very sound. It's higher than it was pre-COVID. So when markets are constructive, we expect to move these opportunities forward. And we're hearing a lot more confidence from the CEOs, CFOs around this. And yeah, we're looking at our own side. As you know, we've been investing in some higher-growth areas, so we get a good balance between our traditionally strong sectors as well as high-growth areas. And we've been seeing some very good momentum in healthcare and technology, as well as areas of traditional strength, which is energy and industrial. And I think we feel very confident in the recovery in DCM. The beginnings of one in LevFin. And so, cautiously optimistic here. So I wouldn't say that it's going to accelerate enormously and with incredible speed, but I think we're feeling much better about the foundation. Mark, anything you'd add?",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q4,Mark Mason,I completely agree.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q4,Operator,Our next question comes from Scott Siefers with Piper Sandler. Your line is now open.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q4,Scott Siefers,"Good afternoon, everybody. Thanks for taking the questions. Have you all assumed any revenue attrition just related to the reduction in force? And I guess just broadly, how might that be embedded in the 2024 revenue guidance? And I guess just at a top level, maybe just a shot or two on...",revenue,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q4,Jane Fraser,"Sorry, Scott, I didn't hear what it was. I think the phone line cut out. The revenue attrition?",revenue,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q4,Scott Siefers,"I'm sorry. Yeah, just curious if you have assumed any revenue attrition related to the reduction in force over the coming year.",revenue,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q4,Jane Fraser,"Okay, no, no we haven't. I think a lot of the moves that we've made from the organization simplification, so the 5,000 or so roles we talked about, they're mainly managerial roles. And they've mainly impacted the functions and the geographies, not nearly so much the revenue from revenue generators. And the other piece is with the client organization, we're actually putting much more time into the hands of our people to drive revenue forward, so I think what we're looking at here is getting rid of areas of bureaucracy and where we've been too complicated, where we can drive efficiency whilst preserving our frontline and encouraging them to be as revenue-productive and delivering the full force of the firm to the client. So I like to see the opposite actually.",revenue,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q4,Scott Siefers,"Okay, perfect, thank you. And then, Mark, can you discuss for a second maybe, just broadly, the flow of expenses through the year? I know that they should begin to decline towards the end, but what happens between now and then? Do they hold kind of flattish with a core rate, or would there be any normal course of business growth?",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q4,Mark Mason,"I think what I'd say is that, you should expect it in the first quarter. We'd likely see an uptick in our total expenses relative to the fourth, in part because, as Jane has mentioned, we anticipate that there'll be more to the org simplification and, therefore, dollars associated with that in Q1. And then, from there, I would expect that you see a downward trend through the fourth quarter.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q4,Scott Siefers,Perfect. All right. Thank you.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q4,Operator,Our next question will come from Vivek Juneja with JP Morgan. Your line is now open.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q4,Vivek Juneja,"Hi Jane, hi Mark. Couple of quick clarifications. On your NII guide, you talked about you're assuming three to six cuts. That's US, I presume, so are you assuming flat, unchanged rates outside the US since you have more sensitivity outside?",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q4,Mark Mason,"Modest declines outside, but yes declines outside as well, but not nearly of the magnitude of what we're talking about in the US.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q4,Vivek Juneja,"Okay. And then, Jane, to your point about the 20,000 head count cuts and I heard you just mentioned 5,000 from managerial positions, where are the rest 15,000 coming there?",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q4,Jane Fraser,"So let me just be clear about where the ones that we've just done and that we're working on through the organization simplification. So when I think about that effort, it will close at the end of the first quarter, as we said. We're expecting to get about $1 billion of run rate save from the org simplification work alone. That constitutes about 5,000 heads. We're just about to, at the end of this month, finish Phase 3, which will mean the first four layers of the organization have been addressed. That's been a net reduction of about 1,500 managers out of a total of 12,000 roles. There's about 13%, and these are mainly manager roles, as I talked about earlier. Then, when we think about where are other expense opportunities on top of this, as Mark was talking about earlier, the stranded costs, we'll be completing the elimination of the stranded costs from the divestitures. We'll be continuing, and you've seen us been continuing that, exiting marginal businesses and hobbies and the like and being very disciplined about that. We've got some businesses where we feel we need to right size the core expense base. Andy Sieg is going to be kicking off that in Wealth, and you'll begin to see some of the impact of that in the first quarter. He's off to a strong start. And then, we've got others where we'll be creating more utilities. We've still got different fragmented activities across the firm that the organization simplification has highlighted. We'll be aggregating those, creating utilities, or are consolidating some of those different functions. And that is before we get to, beginning to get benefits from the transformation, where there'll be efficiencies that come through. We'll still have areas that we're investing. These are going to be, as we talked about, core business investments. It's going to be expense growth still in the top, from volume growth that we've got. And we will be investing in our transformation. And all of this is happening over the medium term to get us to the 11% to 12% RoTCE target we talked about. So that 20,000, it's the number that we estimate of the headcount. I don't love thinking headcount. I like thinking about expenses. I think it's a more meaningful number. So as Mark laid out in his presentation, we've got a net expense save that we're expecting to achieve from the medium term. And these are the raft of different areas that will be contributing to it, and we're working hard at it.",billion,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q4,Operator,Our next question will come from Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research. Your line is now open.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q4,Steven Chubak,"Hi, thanks for taking my questions. Really just some ticky-tack modeling questions on the revenue side. Does the revenue guidance for the full year include any reduction in credit card late fees? And how large of a contributor is that to revenues overall at Citigroup?",revenue,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q4,Mark Mason,"So, let's see, so obviously, the proposal is out there and we've factored in what's knowable as it relates to that. We haven't given guidance externally on what that impact is, but we do believe there are offsets and mitigants that, over time, we'll be able to kind of bring into play. And so, a long-winded way of saying our revenue forecast does assume some basic level of late fee adjustment.",revenue,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q4,Steven Chubak,"Got it. And just on the earlier comments you made, Mark, around Services NII. I am struggling to reconcile the 50/50 NII contribution from rate and volume components, just given average loan to deposits were essentially flat year-on-year, NII grew $3 billion. It does imply a much larger contribution from rates. I know there's deposit funds transfer pricing and other noise. So I was hoping maybe you could unpack that a little bit further.",billion,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q4,Mark Mason,"I mean, there are a lot of factors in there. There's obviously, as well, the mix as it relates to what we have in the US versus outside of the US, so there are a number of factors there and probably too much to kind of take you through on the call here. But we're happy to kind of follow up with you offline and take you through it.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q4,Operator,Our final question comes from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q4,Mike Mayo,"Yeah, just a clarification. When you said medium term on this call as it relates to employee reductions, expense savings, revenue targets, and 11% to 12% RoTCE, does medium term mean by 2026 or does it mean something different?",revenue,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,

2024,Q4,Jane Fraser,"Thank you, Jenn, and a very good morning to everyone. I am going to start with the macro backdrop, and then walk you through our results for the full year. I will share some thoughts on the progress we are making executing our strategy and then conclude with why we have decided to adjust our 2026 return target. We entered 2025 with strategic clarity and good momentum across all our businesses. From the global macro perspective, economies have done a good job tolerating hikes from central banks, and inflation has clearly been receding. While policies will certainly impact economic activity, whether in the form of tariffs or taxes, 2025 doesn’t look that different from 2024. The U.S. remains at the heart of the macro picture. Growth is not only being driven by the higher end consumer, but also by a strong, innovative corporate sector. China’s growth has been slower than expected but there is still the prospect of further stimulus. Europe continues to underachieve. And many emerging markets have re-emerged as bright spots, a trend which certainly benefits us given our global network and deep presence in countries such as India and throughout the Middle East and ASEAN. I told you 2024 was a critical year and I am proud of what we accomplished and how our businesses performed. We finished with a very strong fourth quarter, which Mark will detail shortly. For the full year, our net income was up nearly 40% to $12.7 billion. We exceeded our full-year revenue target with revenues up 5% ex-divestitures. Fee revenue was up 17% and we saw a smaller impact from Argentina’s currency devaluation. We delivered expenses within our guidance and improved our efficiency ratio by 340 bps whilst increasing investment in our Transformation. Our RoTCE grew over 200 bps, albeit from a low level. Our five core businesses each generated positive operating leverage for the full year, which we also achieved at the firm level. Services was up 9% and had another record year, despite the lower rate environment, as a result of new mandates and our emphasis on fee growth. We grew share in both TTS and Securities Services. Capped by our best fourth quarter in a decade, Markets was up 6%. The performance of this franchise in a low-volatility year shows the benefits of our diversified product mix. Equities was strong throughout and was up 26% in what was a record year for us. Banking was up 32% as we gained share across all three investment banking products. And we announced an innovative $25 billion private credit partnership with our longtime client Apollo. Under Vis’ leadership, we expect to continue to gain on our competition in 2025 and beyond. 2024 was the turning point for Wealth, as we sharpened our focus on investments, right-sized the expense base, and improved the client experience. Revenue was up 7% for the year, including fee growth of 18%. Citigold and Asia were particularly strong and Net New Investment Asset flows grew a very pleasing 40%. We attracted top talent throughout the year in Wealth, most recently bringing in Kate Moore as our CIO and Anne McCosker as our Head of Lending. This business has tremendous potential with both new and existing clients, and we are really leaning into it. USPB revenues were up 6% driven by borrowing across both card portfolios and by fee growth. We announced a 10-year extension of our co-branded partnership with American Airlines, ensuring that this valuable relationship enters into its fifth decade. With the acquisition of the Barclays portfolio, we will become American Airlines’ exclusive partner in 2026 and we expect to deliver more value for our cardholders and higher returns for our shareholders as a result. We grew our Tangible Book Value per share by 4% and ended 2024 with a CET1 Ratio of 13.6%, approximately 150 basis points above our regulatory capital requirement. After repurchasing $1 billion in common shares during the fourth quarter, we returned almost $7 billion in capital to our common shareholders in 2024. Given how committed we are to returning capital, I am particularly pleased to announce that our Board authorized a $20 billion share repurchase program. You can see the very tangible progress we are making in executing the strategy that we laid out at our Investor Day three years ago. We have materially simplified our firm since then. We exited consumer businesses in nine countries, and near completion of our wind-downs in three and are on track to exit the final two. This includes Banamex, which we legally separated from our institutional business in December. We are now fully focused on getting ready to IPO, with the timing heavily dependent on regulatory approvals and market conditions of course. To align our structure with our strategy, we went through a significant simplification of our organization, removing management layers and the regional construct. This has accelerated decision making and made us a better partner to our clients. We have strengthened our culture by better aligning compensation with our shareholders’ interests, enhancing our scorecards to ensure we are delivering for clients. We attracted top industry talent throughout our organization and that includes new leaders around my table for Banking, Wealth and Technology. We have raised the bar on what we demand from each other and what we expect to deliver to our clients. We have continued to innovate to improve the client experience and our efficiency. We are now live with Citi Payments Express in 18 countries, and have converted four million retail bank customers to our Simplified Banking platform in the U.S. We accelerated our use of AI, arming 30,000 developers with tools to write code and launched two AI platforms to make 143,000 colleagues more efficient. The investments we’re making to modernize our infrastructure, streamline processes and automate controls are changing how we run the bank. We consolidated our balance sheet reporting to one unified ledger. We implemented a cloud-based solution for risk analytics to better value trading assets. We have closed out three long-standing consent orders. Our capital, liquidity and reserves are robust. Our focused strategy, simpler structure and targeted client selection have all reduced our risk profile significantly. We have made considerable progress on our Transformation. While there are areas that are more advanced, there are others where we still have a lot more work to do, particularly around data and regulatory reporting, as last summer’s regulatory actions reinforced. We have reviewed the entire data program and made changes to its governance and structure as well as increased the level of investment. As CEO, I want this company set up for long-term success and to ensure that we have enough capacity to invest for that. In terms of expense guidance therefore, most of the saves from the org simplification and stranded costs will be used to fund the additional investments we need to make this year in both Transformation and technology. As a result, we expect our total expenses in 2025 to be slightly below the 2024 level and to deliver another year of positive operating leverage. We expect our elevated expense level to be temporary and for it to keep coming down beyond 2025. However, when we take the required investments into account, we now expect our 2026 RoTCE to be between 10% and 11%. The 2026 RoTCE is a waypoint; it is not a destination. Our intention is to continue to improve returns well above that level and we are accountable for doing so. We are relentless in our determination to run the bank more efficiently, fulfill Citi’s potential and meet the expectations of our shareholders. Before I turn it over to Mark, I’d like to acknowledge the catastrophic wildfires in Los Angeles. Many of our clients and several of our colleagues have lost their homes and we will do whatever we can to help them recover from this devastating event. They and their loved ones are in all of our thoughts at Citi. Now, over to Mark.","billion, revenue, net income, liquidity, cet1",yes,Yes,cet1,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,Yes,cet1 ratio
2024,Q4,Mark Mason,"Thanks, Jane and good morning, everyone. I am going to start with the fourth quarter and full-year financial results, focusing on year-over-year comparisons unless I indicate otherwise. I’ll also focus on our current expectations for 2025 and 2026. On slide 7, we show financial results for the full firm, which reflect improved performance both in the quarter and the year. As a reminder, in the fourth quarter of last year, revenues were significantly impacted by Argentina currency devaluation. Adjusted revenues and non-interest revenues for the full firm and Services are shown in the appendix of the earnings presentation on slide 36. This quarter we reported net income of $2.9 billion, EPS of $1.34 and an RoTCE of 6.1% on $19.6 billion of revenues, generating positive operating leverage for the firm and in each of our businesses. Total revenues were up 12%, driven by growth in each of our businesses and a smaller impact of Argentina currency devaluation. Net interest income excluding Markets was roughly flat, with growth in USPB and Wealth offset by declines in Corporate/Other and Banking. Non-interest revenue excluding Markets was up 40%, driven by continued strong fee momentum across Services, Banking and Wealth along with lower partner payments in USPB as well as a smaller impact of Argentina currency devaluation. And total Markets revenues were up 36%. Expenses were $13.2 billion, down 18%, largely driven by the absence of the FDIC special assessment and restructuring charge in the prior year. Excluding the impact of the FDIC special assessment and divestiture-related impacts, expenses were down 7%, driven by the absence of the restructuring charge in the prior year and savings associated with our organizational simplification, partially offset by higher volume related expenses. Cost of credit was $2.6 billion, largely consisting of cards’ net credit losses and ACL build. At the end of the quarter, we had over $22 billion in total reserves with a reserve-to-funded loans ratio of 2.7%. And on a full-year basis, we delivered $12.7 billion of net income with an RoTCE of 7.0%. On slide 8, we show full year revenue trends by business from 2021 to 2024. This year, we delivered $81.1 billion of revenue, up 5% on an ex-divestiture basis, driven by growth in each of our businesses and a smaller impact of Argentina currency devaluation. Services revenues increased 9% to $19.6 billion, benefiting from a smaller impact of Argentina currency devaluation, fee growth and higher deposit volumes. Markets revenues increased 6% to $19.8 billion, primarily driven by growth in Equities, which had its highest annual revenue in a decade, and Spread Products. Banking revenues increased 32% to $6.2 billion, largely driven by growth in Investment Banking, with fees up 42% as we gained approximately 50 basis points of share on an increased wallet. Wealth revenues increased 7% to $7.5 billion, primarily driven by a 15% increase in non interest revenue as we continue to grow client investment assets. USPB revenues increased 6% to $20.4 billion, driven by growth in cards, as we continue to see strong customer engagement and an increase in interest-earning balances, as well as lower partner payments. Overall, this year demonstrates another year of performance consistent with our medium-term target of 4 to 5% annual growth and the value of our diversified business model. On slide 9, we show the full year expense trend from 2021 to 2024. Excluding the impact of the FDIC special assessment, our full-year expenses were $53.8 billion, in line with our target. Expense reduction was driven by savings related to our organizational simplification and stranded cost reduction, as well as lower restructuring and repositioning charges. Organizational simplification, stranded cost reduction as well as efforts to drive efficiencies across the businesses contributed to a net decline of roughly 10 thousand direct staff. These savings were mostly offset by higher volume-related expenses as well as investments in the Transformation and other risk and controls and the Civil Money Penalties. As you can see at the bottom of the page, we spent $2.9 billion on Transformation this year, which includes investments in our infrastructure, platforms, applications, and data. Transformation investments were up 1%, driven by an increase in certain programs, including data, largely offset by a reduction in the Transformation Bonus Award. And we spent $11.8 billion on technology, focused on digital innovation, new product development, client experience and other areas such as cyber security. Turning to slide 10, we provide details on our $2.4 trillion balance sheet, which decreased 3% sequentially, largely driven by the impact of foreign exchange translation. In the fourth quarter, we deployed some of our excess liquidity into loans, while maintaining a 116% LCR and $933 billion of available liquidity resources. Our $1.3 trillion deposit base remains well-diversified across regions, industries, customers and account types. We maintained strong capital, ending the year with a preliminary 13.6% CET1 Capital ratio, approximately 150 basis points above our regulatory capital requirement of 12.1%. And for the year we returned nearly $7 billion in the form of common dividends and repurchases to our shareholders. Turning to the businesses on slide 11, we show the results for Services for the fourth quarter and full year. Services revenues were up 15%, driven by a smaller impact of Argentina currency devaluation and reflecting continued momentum across Securities Services and TTS, both of which gained share this year. NIR increased 61%, driven by a smaller impact of Argentina currency devaluation, as well as continued strength in underlying fee drivers such as USD Clearing, Commercial Card spend, Cross Border transactions, and assets under custody and administration. NII was roughly flat, as the benefit of higher deposit volumes was offset by the impact of lower interest rates in Argentina. Expenses increased 1%, driven by continued investment in technology and platform modernization, partially offset by productivity savings. Cost of credit was $112 million with a net ACL build of $84 million and net credit losses of $28 million. Average loans increased 5% primarily driven by continued demand for export and agency finance as well as working capital loans. Average deposits increased 4% as we continue to see growth in operating deposits. Services generated positive operating leverage and delivered net income of $1.9 billion and $6.5 billion for the year. And continues to deliver a high RoTCE, coming in at 29.9% and 26.0% for the year. On slide 12, we show the results for Markets for the fourth quarter and full year. Markets saw its highest fourth quarter revenue in a decade and increased 36% with broad based gains across all products. Fixed Income revenues increased 37%, driven by Rates and Currencies, which were up 39%, and Spread Products and Other Fixed Income, up 30%, both reflecting increased client activity. Rates and Currencies also benefitted from a conducive trading environment, compared to a challenging prior year quarter. Spread Products and Other Fixed Income was driven by Credit and Mortgage Trading as well as higher securitization volumes. Equities revenues increased 34%, driven in part by strong execution of strategic client transactions in Cash Equities. And momentum also continued in Prime, with balances up approximately 23%. Expenses decreased 8%, primarily driven by lower legal expenses and productivity savings. Cost of credit was $134 million, driven by a net ACL build, primarily related to Spread Products. Average loans increased 6%, primarily driven by asset-backed lending in Spread Products as well as margin loans in Equities. Average trading account assets increased 15%, largely driven by client demand for US Treasuries and foreign government securities. Markets generated another quarter of positive operating leverage and delivered net income of $1.0 billion and $4.9 billion for the year. And delivered an RoTCE of 7.4% and 9.1% for the year. On slide 13, we show the results for Banking for the fourth quarter and full year. Banking revenues were up 27%, largely driven by Investment Banking, with fees up 35% as we saw growth across all products. DCM was driven by continued Investment Grade issuance momentum and increased Leveraged Finance activity. ECM saw strong issuance activity particularly in follow-on and convertible instruments. In M&A, growth was driven by continued strong client engagement as well as the completion of previously announced acquisitions, given the more conducive macro environment. For the year, we gained share across regions, products and several sectors, including Healthcare and Technology. Corporate Lending revenues, excluding mark-to-market on loan hedges, decreased 24%, driven by lower revenue share and volumes, partially offset by a smaller impact of Argentina currency devaluation. Expenses decreased 9%, primarily driven by benefits of headcount reduction as we right sized the workforce and expense base, partially offset by higher volume related expenses. Cost of credit was a benefit of $240 million, driven by a net ACL release of $247 million, primarily driven by improved macroeconomic conditions. Banking generated positive operating leverage for the fourth quarter in a row and delivered net income of $356 million and $1.5 billion for the year. And delivered an RoTCE of 6.5% and 7.0% for the year. On slide 14, we show the results for Wealth for the fourth quarter and full year. As you can see from our performance this quarter, we are making good progress against our strategy and expect that momentum to continue. Revenues were up 20%, driven by a 22% increase in NIR as we grew investment fees, with client investment assets up 18%, including net new investment assets of $16 billion. NII increased 20%, driven by higher average deposit spreads and volumes. Expenses decreased 3%, driven by the continued benefit of headcount reductions as we right size the workforce and expense base. End-of-period client balances increased 8%, driven by higher client investment asset flows and market valuations. Average deposits increased 3%, reflecting the transfer of relationships and the associated deposits from USPB, partially offset by a shift in deposits to higher-yielding investments on Citi’s platform. Average loans decreased 1%, as we continued to optimize capital usage. Wealth generated a pre-tax margin of 21% and another quarter of positive operating leverage, delivering net income of $334 million and $1.0 billion for the year. And delivered an RoTCE of 10.1% and 7.6% for the year. On slide 15, we show the results for U.S. Personal Banking for the fourth quarter and full year. U.S. Personal Banking revenues were up 6%, driven by NII growth of 5% and lower partner payments. Branded Cards revenues increased 7%, with interest-earning balance growth of 7% as payment rates continue to normalize and we continue to see spend growth, which was up 5%. Retail Services revenues increased 7%, driven by lower partner payments and interest-earning balance growth of 3%. And Retail Banking revenues were roughly flat, as the impact of higher deposit spreads was offset by the impact of the transfer of relationships and the associated deposits to our Wealth business. Expenses decreased 2%, driven by continued productivity savings, partially offset by higher volume-related expenses. Cost of credit was $2.2 billion, largely driven by net credit losses, as well as a build primarily for volume growth. Average deposits decreased 18%, largely driven by the transfer of relationships and the associated deposits to our Wealth business. USPB generated another quarter of positive operating leverage and delivered net income of $392 million and $1.4 billion for the year. And delivered an RoTCE of 6.2% and 5.5% for the year. On slide 16, we show results for All Other on a managed basis, which includes Corporate/Other and Legacy Franchises and excludes divestiture-related items. Revenues decreased 34%, primarily driven by net investment securities losses as we repositioned the portfolio, higher funding costs and closed exits and wind-downs. Expenses decreased 51%, primarily driven by the absence of the FDIC special assessment and restructuring charge in the prior year, as well as the reduction from the closed exits and wind-downs. And cost of credit was $397 million, with net credit losses of $257 million and a net ACL build of $140 million, primarily driven by Mexico. Turning to slide 18, where I will walk you through our current expectations for 2025. As a reminder, what underpins our current expectations is a reflection of a number of scenarios that include different macro and capital market environments. And based on what we know today, we expect revenues to be around $83.5 to $84.5 billion, a roughly 3 to 4% increase year-over-year. We expect a continuation of the NIR ex-Markets momentum we saw this year, driven by: Investment Banking, as we continue to gain share in areas of strategic focus – such as Healthcare, Technology as well as Leveraged Finance and Sponsors – assuming a constructive industry wallet. Wealth, supported by a continued focus on growth in client investment assets and banker productivity, which will drive investment revenue. Services, as we execute the strategy we laid out at our Investor Day in June – expanding our leadership position with large institutions and growing our market share with Commercial clients in TTS. And in Securities Services, continuing to gain share through investments in our digital and data capabilities while deepening with asset managers and asset owners. Turning to slide 19, we expect NII ex-Markets to be up modestly this year. However, there are several tailwinds and headwinds that I will walk you through. Looking at the lefthand side of the page, we expect most of the increase to come from volume growth and mix, primarily driven by higher loan volumes in USPB, mainly in cards, and deposit volumes in Services. We expect a continued benefit from lower yielding investment securities rolling off and being repriced into higher yielding assets such as cash, loans, and securities. Partially offsetting these tailwinds are several headwinds, including various scenarios around: Lower rates, both in US and non-US, which we expect to be mostly offset by repricing actions across the franchise. As well as the potential impact of card late fee reduction and FX. Turning to slide 20, we expect expenses to be slightly lower than $53.8 billion for 2025. Our expectations reflect continued benefits from our organizational simplification, reduction in stranded costs and productivity savings from our prior investments. However, offsetting most of these benefits are increased investments in the Transformation, technology and the businesses as well as higher volume-related expenses. Embedded in our outlook for the year is roughly $600 million for repositioning, which remains elevated, as we continue to reduce stranded costs, drive efficiencies across the businesses and as benefits from investments in Transformation and technology allow us to eliminate manual processes. As Jane said, we recognize that our expense base remains elevated. And we remain very focused on bringing down our expenses each year while ensuring that we have enough capacity to invest in the company. Now turning to slide 21, I’ll talk through our expectations for returns going forward. As we enter 2025 and think forward to 2026, we continue to have a clear path to improved returns. Having gone through another robust planning process, and having provided revenue and expense targets for 2025, we want to update our 2026 RoTCE target range. In 2026 we expect continued revenue growth from both NII and NIR with drivers largely consistent with recent performance. We expect expenses to decline from 2025 and are targeting an expense level below $53 billion. The reduction in our expense base will come from a decrease in legacy and stranded costs, a more normalized level of severance, and an increase in productivity savings from our prior investments. We will maintain strict discipline on the entire expense base, looking for more opportunities to drive further efficiencies as we go into 2026. We also remain laser focused on continuing to optimize RWA but as you know, the future of capital rules and therefore requirements remain uncertain. In light of all of this, we are now targeting an RoTCE in the range of 10 to 11% in 2026. We are committed to driving positive operating leverage and improving our returns every year for both the firm and the businesses, and we will do so in a sustainable way which will set this company up for long-term success. With that in mind, as part of the $20 billion share repurchase program, we plan on buying back $1.5 billion of common stock in the first quarter. As we take a step back, 2024 represents another year of solid progress and a set of proof points towards improving firmwide and business performance, as well as continued execution against our Transformation. And as we enter 2025, these priorities remain critical as we continue to make progress on improving our returns. With that, Jane and I will be happy to take your questions.","capital ratio, billion, , revenue, net income, liquidity, million, trillion, net interest income, cet1",yes,Yes,"cet1, capital ratio",Yes,lcr,No,,No,,No,,Yes,fdic,No,,Yes,lcr

2024,Q4,Jim Mitchell,"Hey, good morning everyone. Just I think as Jane noted, it seems like a material driver of the reduction in the RoTCE target in 2026 is expenses. I think you kind of backed off the lower end of that, given higher investments in the Transformation but also talked about it being somewhat temporary. We appreciate the below $53 billion for 2026, but how much more is there to go beyond that in terms of eliminating parallel systems, running parallel systems, reduced consultant spend and all that stuff. Is there still that path to a 60% or lower efficiency ratio? Thanks.",billion,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q4,Jane Fraser,"Happy New Year, Jim. I know you want to talk about the guidance, so let me put it into context here. Last year, you've heard me be very clear about our two priorities. First one is driving the business performance and the second is executing the Transformation. You've seen this quarter, you've seen last quarter, you've seen the full year our businesses are delivering the progress we wanted them to. The strategy is working. We've changed the business mix. We're generating more fee-based revenues. You see that in Services with NIR up 37% this year, Wealth NIR up 15%, IB fees up 35%, an important part of the mix around the quality of our earnings. We said Services as a crown jewel. It's delivered growth, high returns, it's taken share. It's a crown jewel. We made a strategic play in Wealth, and you've seen us very steadily prove out why we can be a force globally with a clear path to delivering the financial performance that we said we would do. We've consistently delivered on our revenue and expense targets. And I see a lot more opportunity and more upside to strengthen our business performance. We're very tangibly getting after it. We're pretty excited by it. The second priority, Transformation. I've got to tell you, I'm broadly pleased with the progress we've made in risk and compliance and accountability. Kind of excited by the work we've got going on in controls for the business as well at the moment. We've been very transparent. Data is an area we have more work to do in. We increased our investments last year, as you know. And then as part of the annual planning process, we took a big step back to reassess our plan. And I decided, along with Mark and the management team, we needed to expand the scope and accelerate some of the work to satisfy our regulators' expectations. I'm confident that the decision to do that, it was the right one. It's the right one for our Transformation efforts, it’s certainly the right one for the firm overall. I could have taken a short-term decision to cut other investments that are important for our long-term competitiveness, I'm just not going to do that. You shouldn't want me to do that. And as I said in the opening comments, this 2026 target is a waypoint, not the final destination.",revenue,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q4,Mark Mason,"I just want to address the second part of your question, Jim, in terms of the path to the less than 60%. I think Jane framed it out quite nicely in that we're building a franchise that will have continued and sustainable top line revenue momentum. We are focused on driving out the inefficiencies and stranded costs and Legacy Franchise expenses from the organization and the benefits from these investments we've made in the Transformation will yield a lower cost structure over time as well. And so the combination of those things will get us to that targeted operating efficiency as we come out of 2026 at less than 60%. So yes, there is still a path, and we are focused on that path.",revenue,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q4,Jim Mitchell,"Okay. Great. That's very helpful. And then just maybe pivoting to the buyback, great to see the $20 billion authorization. Obviously, I can't help but ask about beyond 1Q. If we do sort of get this more certainty maybe no increase in capital requirements, does that start to help you maybe at least temporarily lower the buffer to take advantage of, you’re trading below tangible book and getting the accretion and accelerating the buyback? Or how do you think about the rest of the year on the buybacks?",billion,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q4,Mark Mason,"Look, I'll make a couple of comments. So one, we're very pleased to have announced the buyback program at $20 billion. I think, in many ways, that is a demonstration, if you will, of continued confidence in the earnings generation and momentum that we have around that as well as the recognition that we are trading below book and not where we want to be. And you've heard both Jane and I speak to the importance of increasing and doing more in the way of buybacks. We've increased that to $1.5 billion. I think that supports that same degree of confidence that we have in the momentum. We are constantly looking at every year on an annual basis as we go through our planning process at the management buffer that we have of 100 basis points. And despite the last couple of quarters at running above the 13.1%, our target is the 13.1%. And so as we go through the balance of the year, as we get clarity on reg rules and what have you, you'll see us continue to manage down to that 13.1% and obviously, the two important characteristics that we keep in mind is the opportunity to invest more in the business at accretive returns, and where we're trading and the need to do more buybacks in order to reflect the underlying value. So target is 13.1%. We continue to look at that management buffer as the regulatory environment evolves. And we'll continue to do more in the way of capital actions as that makes sense.",billion,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q4,Operator,"Our next question comes from the line of John McDonald with Truist Securities. Your line is now open, please go ahead.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q4,John Mcdonald,"Thank you. Mark, just wanted to follow up on your answer to Jim right there. So when you look at the 10% to 11% RoTCE target for 2026. Is that kind of assuming you'll be around the target or like using the 13.1% as the target? And then longer term, you hope to bring that target down as rules get clarified and the franchise gets simplified?",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q4,Mark Mason,"Hey John, good to hear from you. In fact, yes, the 10% to 11% RoTCE target we've set for 2026 does assume that we are running and using a 13.1% CET1 ratio obviously, there'll be an SCB that comes out sometime later this year. The rules are continuing to evolve and what have you, and we'll factor those in as we know more about them. But yes, it does assume the 13.1% which is our management target, if you will, for CET1.",cet1,yes,Yes,cet1,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,Yes,cet1 ratio
2024,Q4,John Mcdonald,"Okay. Great. And then my next question is, could you clarify what you're expecting this year for card net charge-offs? Understand the quarterly cadence has seasonality. But for the full year, it sounds like you're expecting the charge-offs to be in the range of last year's guidance. Can you just kind of clarify that? And then maybe just talk about provision build, which you had a lot of in 2024 and whether that could slow down as the maturation of balances slows down? Thank you.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q4,Mark Mason,"Sure. So in terms of the net credit losses and the forecast that we have, we are expecting that the net credit losses will be at the high end of the range that we've given. So in the case of Branded Cards, that 3.5% to 4% is the full year range that we've given. In the case of Retail Services, it's 5.75% to 6.25%, excuse me, and so right now, Retail Services is at that high end at 6.28% for 2024. We'd expect it to stay at that high end, and then on Branded Cards, we're at 3.64%, we'd expect it to creep up to about the 4% level over the course of the year. But remember, that is a full year NCL rate, and we know that there's seasonality through the quarters. And so you'll see movement through the quarters based on that dynamic. And then just in terms of the provision build, there are a couple of drivers there. One is obviously volume, and we do expect to see volume growth in USPB. So that will be an important factor in how the CECL calculations are done. And then the second driver is obviously, as you know, we run models and the models they have a base scenario, they have a downside, an upside scenario depending on the broader macro factors, unemployment, GDP, et cetera, et cetera, and our weighting towards the likelihood of high or upside or downside scenario, those factors become important considerations in the provisioning. And so that's kind of how we think about that going into 2025. I hope that helps.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q4,Operator,"Our next question will come from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open, please go ahead.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q4,Mike Mayo,"Hi, just a clarification. So you are guiding for three consecutive years of lower expenses including that $600 million repositioning this year. So they were down in 2024, you're guiding them lower in 2025 and you guide them lower in 2026 again, and you're also guiding for three consecutive years of higher revenues based on what you said. I didn't see that in the written materials, but I think I heard you say that, Mark. So three years of lower expenses, three years of higher revenues to at least 2026. Is that correct?",million,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q4,Mark Mason,"Yes, that is correct. I think you described it correctly. We're seeing continued momentum on the top line. and we're focused on continuing to bring our expenses down just as we did in 2024, a tad bit in 2025 and then more in 2026.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q4,Mike Mayo,"All right. And then I guess this is for Jane. Well, that beats haggis on toast, if you achieve that. But I'm wondering why that efficiency might not improve even more. I mean if you have $5 billion of stranded costs and Transformation costs in 2024 and some of that goes down. I heard you're investing in tech and Transformation and volume and the businesses. And there's always a trade-off between the bottom line results you showed today and the growth you show in the future, and it seems like you're going to get this done, the lower expenses while you're leaning into a little bit extra growth. So talk about that trade-off and where you're leaning in for growth a little bit more.",billion,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q4,Jane Fraser,"First of all, I'm a little disturbed by your comment about haggis on toast. It's haggis with mashed potatoes and whiskey, just to be clear for everyone. It's Robert Burns night coming up soon. On expenses, Mike and everyone, expenses are a focus not just for Mark and I, but for the entire management team. We're making sure that focus and discipline is really getting installed and instilled into the DNA of Citi. And you've seen that, as you referenced, we've been meeting our expense guidance over the last couple of years, we've been driving positive operating efficiency. We're all very focused on improving our operating expense base. Consolidating technology, the simplification work, automation, getting different utilities put in place rather than fragmented around the firm, using AI tools now our, location strategy, right? So that core operating expense base is something that we're really looking at how do we drive to be more efficient, more modern and getting it to the level it should be for the revenues that we generate. We all want Transformation to get done quickly, and we want it to get done right. So that is why our expenses are temporarily elevated to make the investments that needed there. This is not all run rate. And as you say, as CEO, I will not sacrifice the right long-term investments in our growth and competitiveness for short-term expediency. This is a way point.

2024,Q4,Operator,"Our next question will come from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open, please go ahead.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q4,Betsy Graseck,"Hi good morning. Jane, just to follow up on what you mentioned, as you do execute, we all expect, or at least I do, that the market will be giving you credit for that execution, and meaning multiples should increase. I have a few questions here on the buyback, because right now,today, as we all know, you're trading below book, it has got to be, buying back stock has got to be the most accretive use of capital today. And why wait on the buyback when you can lean into it today and keep your 2026 guide, I mean, the old guide was 11% to 12% RoTCE, new guide, 10% to 11%. I'm kind of confused why you don't pull that lever more aggressively because buying back the stock, the accretion to tangible book, it’s got to be the easiest thing to do to help that RoTCE go up. When you compare and contrast against all the hard work you've been doing, which will obviously be very important to getting the RoTCE up. But why not lean more into that buyback? And can you give us a sense of the timing of that $20 billion? Thank you.",billion,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q4,Jane Fraser,"Yes, Betsy, I love the passion. I've got to say I can hear the determination in your voice. I think it's the same determination we feel. Look, we're very committed to returning capital shareholders period. Full stop. We’ve got a $20 billion buyback program, as Mark said, that is reflective of the growing earnings power that we have and our confidence in the path ahead. We've been increasing the amount of capital return over the last few quarters. I'm also happy to see a more aggressive Basel III scenario firmly off the table. We have, nonetheless, a 13.1% CET1 ratio that we put in the plan that can change over time as well. But there's not, there's not complete certainty around where the capital requirements are going to go. We hope there will be a holistic one that is reflective of the risk profile of the bank that's been improving significantly over the last few years. So we have some great growth opportunities. I look at the different areas. I'm excited by what we see in Wealth. We've got a great runway with our clients who want to do business with us in Banking. We've got some very important investments and an investment agenda that we're putting in to help us continue growing the bank, gaining competitiveness in a responsible way. I'll just conclude with exactly your point. The bar is high on those investments. We don't make them unless we see extremely attractive marginal RoTCE. And there's a lot of things we say no to in order to put the $20 billion program in place. In terms of timing, like our peers, we're not committing to a particular time frame from this, but you can see our commitment. You can hear our commitment.","billion, cet1",yes,Yes,cet1,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,Yes,basel iii,Yes,cet1 ratio
2024,Q4,Operator,"Our next question will come from the line of Ebrahim Poonawala with Bank America. Your line is now open, please go ahead.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q4,Ebrahim Poonawala,"I guess maybe, Jane, I wanted to follow up on a couple of segments. I think you said 2024 turning point for Wealth, and we've seen very steady progress on the RoTCE in Wealth. Just talk to us in terms of, Andy Sieg’s being in the seat for a year now, you've seen progress. What needs to happen? Just talk to us a little bit about the franchise positioning competitively both in the U.S. and abroad as you think about going head-to-head with some of your global competitors and where are the most likely growth opportunities over the next year or two?",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q4,Jane Fraser,"Yes. So, our vision, my vision is that we become a global leader in wealth management. There are not many firms that have the globality of Citi. We have all the assets, especially the client relationships all around the world, which were just not tapped for investments in the past. It's a big opportunity. We have $5.3 trillion “off us” from existing clients. And I think the fact that I would find interesting is 55% of it, it's almost $3 trillion with affluent clients in our branch network in America, in the U.S. We're also very well-positioned to capture new wealth, just think about what Citi does in terms of our footprint, our capabilities really supports the wealth creation, from the Commercial Bank, our Investment Banking side, Markets, obviously, Services supporting it, too. These are all great feeders for us to strengthen wealth relationships with our clients. So we brought in Andy. Andy greatly sharpened the focus on the investment business, this is where we see the big upside. He's been building a differentiated value proposition around wealth creation. He’s been leveraging a lot of the leading capital market capabilities, the different relationships we have with PE firms, asset managers around the world. Get a great platform in place and importantly, improving our client experience, again, particularly around investments, asset allocation, performance, et cetera. What I have also got to love is the surgical approach that he's taking to the expense base and driving productivity, something that we're doing across the firm. I'm also excited by the talent he's bringing, in the market leaders like Kate Moore and Keith Glenfield in the investment space. And we've made a lot of investments in training and building this investment culture that we didn't have before. So to your point, the proof points are working. Q4 revenue up 20%, operating margin at 21% on its way to 25% to 30%, 10% RoTCE on its way to 15% to 20%. These last few quarters, you've just seen us on that march. And the number I'm most excited by, net new investment asset inflow of $42 billion, up 40% year-over-year. The strategy is working. We're going to be a leader in wealth, the growth opportunities,Asia U.S., Middle East, all the places where we are with our existing clients and the new wealth generators of the future.","billion, trillion, revenue",yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q4,Ebrahim Poonawala,And if I can draw a parallel to the Banking segment with the RoTCE is about 5% to 6% last few quarters. There you brought in Vis Raghavan from JPMorgan. Just give us a sense of could we see a similar trajectory in that business over the next 12 months and where the opportunities are to improve that ROE?,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q4,Jane Fraser,"Yes. I think absolutely, a strong performance, the strategy we have in place is delivering nicely. So if you look at the revenues, the investment banking fees, positive operating leverage all through the year and gaining share. All three products gaining share in all three in all of the geographies we're in, I'm really excited and happy to see the health care and technology,two areas that we've been investing heavily behind. And you're also seeing us playing a leading role in some of the key transactions, the biggest transactions last year. Mars Kellanova, single adviser, big role in Boeing, and then just this week, the J&J acquisition of Intracellular. So the deals that matter, this is where you're seeing Citi playing a leading role in. So when Vis joined, the mandate, a bit similar to Andy, becoming a top three investment bank, deliver the full potential of One Citi to our clients. So we've got a lot of upside there, instilling some more discipline in capital allocation, client coverage, some of the cross-firm linkages. We're getting a lot more from our people. We've been bringing in some great new talent we've also been cutting some of the unproductive spend. So I think what you can see is we're just on a path of systematically growing our wallet. We'll be improving our operating margin, generating higher returns. That should be your expectation over the next couple of years of what you'll see from us. And as we head into great environment in 2025 that should be pretty conducive for a lot of client activity. I'm very confident we're well positioned. We've got the groundwork done to take advantage of it.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q4,Mark Mason,"Ebrahim, I thought I heard you say RoTCE of 5%. It's actually 7% for the full year for Banking and on its way to the target that we've set of mid-teens for our Banking business.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q4,Operator,"Our next question comes from the line of Erika Najarian with UBS. Your line is now open, please go ahead.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q4,Erika Najarian,"Thank you. Hate to ask the umpteenth question on the buyback, but clearly, the way the stock is reacting today, the buyback is very important to your shareholders. I guess my first question, if I could have the two questions, is it's very clear that you want to return capital to shareholders. It's very clear that you have excess capital. It's very clear that your PPNR trajectory is positive. And so what are the specific mile markers that that Citi needs to see in order to increase that pacing from that $1.5 billion a quarter to something is more suggestive of a pace that that would be in line with that $20 billion authorization? And I know that's been asked of you already, but is it the consent order? Is it the stress test? We had some news over the holidays that were positive for the sector. Like what are those specific mile markers? I mean you're doing it on the PPNR side, right? Like what do you need to see to have even more confidence, again, like leaning into Betsy’s words, to go all in on the buyback?",billion,no,No,,No,,No,,Yes,stress test,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q4,Mark Mason,"Yes. So thank you for the question. Let me make clear a couple of things. So one, and I've said this already, so I apologize for repeating myself, but one, our target for CET1 is 13.1%, and so what you're going to see over the course of the year is us managing down to that target? That's kind of one point. The second point I want to be clear is that it's not the consent order. That's not something that that is impacting the capital actions and decisions that we take. We obviously forecast out the performance. As I've said, Jane has said already, we see very strong continued earnings momentum, managing towards a 13.1% CET1 ratio. And you'll see the buyback trajectory reflect getting down to that CET1. The one thing I will mention, and you mentioned already is that we obviously have another CCAR process, stress test that we will go through. And none of us can predict kind of what's on the other side of that from an SCB point of view, but that will be an important factor as we get through the first half of the year and into the second half of the year in terms of kind of the level of buybacks that we will be taking on a quarter-by quarter basis. So I hope that helped. There are no artificial constraints, so to speak, that are in place. This is us planning and forecasting the performance of the franchise ensuring they can fuel high-returning growth opportunities so that we're building a sustainable franchise, looking at the capital requirements that we have and the management buffer that we put in place and therefore, taking that excess capacity and putting it towards buybacks, but with an eye towards the regulatory environment that we're in, and what I mean by that are the capital requirements that come out of the annual stress testing process that's run. So that's the basics of it as we sit here today. I guess I'm just trying to think about everybody is super focused on what you had said previously, now you have different targets, but is it just really like, look, it just takes longer, we'll get there, but just takes longer. And maybe just an addendum to that, how should we expect Banamex to impact that 10% to 11% RoTCE in terms of the immediate impact after IPO and then after you deploy that excess capital that you get back?",cet1,yes,Yes,cet1,No,,No,,Yes,"ccar, stress test",No,,No,,No,,Yes,cet1 ratio
2024,Q4,Jane Fraser,"Erika, we chose the words very carefully to say that 2026 is a way point, it's not the destination. And when I'm looking at it, I'm looking out to 2027, 2028, what is the bank we want to be in terms of our strategy, our performance, our culture, all those different dimensions. And we just relentlessly keep going down that path, but we're going to take the right and responsible decisions as we go down it. So our potential is for more than our medium-term target RoTCE, the potential of the bank and the journey that we're on is to improve our returns beyond there, for sure.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q4,Mark Mason,"And just in terms of the impact and the timing that Jane referenced, just keep in in mind that the financial impact of exiting Banamex comes two forms. One is the gain or loss on sale and two is the risk weighted asset release. The gain or loss on sale will run through the P&L at deconsolidation, so that's the point where we've gotten, or we've IPO-ed more than the 50%. And the ultimate benefit will be driven by the RWA release when we fully divest our stake. And so hopefully, that helps, but it's not until we’ve deconsolidated that we see that P&L impact and the CTA and other things like that kind of flow through the P&L for Banamex.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q4,Operator,"Our next question will come from Gerard Cassidy with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open, please go ahead.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q4,Gerard Cassidy,"Jane, I'll pass on the haggis, but I'll take you up on the whiskey.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q4,Jane Fraser,I didn't say I was buying just to be clear.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q4,Gerard Cassidy,"Okay, I got it. Our expense report on this end. Anyway, just following up, Mark, on your comments about the IPO with Banamex. Can you guys remind us, or refresh our memories, on when the IPO process starts, once it goes public, what percentage ownership do you guys expect to have? And second, have you given us any color on whether you expect to report a gain on this transaction or a loss as you just referenced, that will go through the P&L?",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q4,Mark Mason,"We haven't given any sense for the exact timing of that. As you know, this is a process. And so Jane just spoke to the timing of that process, the first step, having been completed on December 1 with the separation, we are now obviously gearing up and readying ourselves for the IPO. There'll obviously be important filings associated with that given our intent to dual list, there will be regulatory approvals that are required kind of as we make headway with potential investors as part of the IPO process. And so there are a series of IPO steps that we will need to take over the course of the year in order to continue to ready ourselves and there are things that we don't control. Like as Jane mentioned, the regulatory approval process and timing for that as well as the market conditions. And so all of those factors are important. And then how the IPO occurs in terms of percentage that is taken on at that first tranche versus follow-on tranches are important factors on when we get to deconsolidation. And so I haven't given you an exact timing on that but you can envision kind of 15% tranches that happen over kind of a 12-, 18-month, 24-month period. And then obviously reaching a point of deconsolidation at which point that currency translation adjustment starts to flow through the P&L. There's no material impact on capital, but it does flow through the P&L. And then ultimately, we exit 100% over the course of time. So I'm sorry, I'm not giving you precise dates and percentages. And part of that is because we are obviously on the front end of not only readying ourselves but considering alternative IPO structures and potential investors/shareholders as part of that process.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q4,Gerard Cassidy,"Well, I appreciate the insights. And then as a follow-up question, and I really don't mean this as a ‘what have you done for me lately?’ type of question because you guys have made so much progress in what you're doing in your strategic changes here. But can you talk about the U.S. Personal Banking, many of your questions today is about the RoTCE consolidated and how you can improve that, and this business has a very low RoTCE as you guys know, below your cost of capital. And structurally, when you look at it, if you look at the loans at the end of period just over $220 billion, your deposits about $90 billion, which is quite a bit different than your peers who have much higher ROEs. So how do you approach this business? And again, I know you've been very busy divesting a lot of the businesses that are not important, but it seems to me that this is a giant hurdle that you guys have to approach at some point in the near future.",billion,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q4,Jane Fraser,"Let me just chat a bit through this. So what’s the path to the higher returns in U.S. Personal Banking, it’s coming from top line revenue growth, improved expense base and also a lot more normalized credit environment, and that gets us to the mid- to high-teen returns in the medium term. I think we feel very confident and comfortable in that. You're seeing the proof points I talked about Banking, Wealth earlier, we’ve had another good quarter of revenue growth, had the ninth consecutive quarter of positive operating leverage. So I think you should be getting some comfort around that. What's going to drive that growth? Co-brands, we just extended with American to be their sole issuer. It's going to give exciting benefits to the American Airlines and the Citi cardholders. And it will be beneficial for both our growth and our returns. In the proprietary front, we're investing. There's a lot of investment in innovation to drive growth. The refreshed Strata Premier Card, we've been enhancing the reward offerings and you're seeing us often now #1 in recognitions and awards around that area. Retail Services being forensically focused on improving the partnership economics and driving top line growth. And then Retail Banking,therewe're driving primary checking growth, we’ve putin simplified banking, so we get a much more streamlined customer proposition that's driving more of a relationship-based banking approach as opposed to a transactional one. Importantly as well, the Retail Bank has been feeding our Wealth business. I think you heard me earlier talking about that almost $3 trillion “off us” investment opportunity that we have from the retail banking customer base. We transferred $17 billion of deposits from USPB to Wealth, so you've got to take that, those dynamics into account. So I hope you're taking from me, I feel confident in our ability to get to the medium term targets we set for the business of mid- to high-teens. I feel comfortable about the growth trajectory that we've got based off the innovations we're putting through and the changes. And good expense discipline and a better credit environment. So when you look at the mix of our business, Ithink you'll see us performing nicely here.","billion, trillion, revenue",yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q4,Operator,"Our next question comes from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open, please go ahead. MATT O’",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q4,Connor,"Hi, I just want to follow up on Page 9 where you break out the technology and Transformation investment spend. And sorry if I missed this, but did you talk about the pace of those two levels in your 2025 and 2026 expense guidance? I know directionally, you said it's going up. But did you give a magnitude?",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q4,Mark Mason,"I did not. Obviously, for both technology and Transformation those are areas that we are going to continue to invest in for all the reasons that we've mentioned. They obviously contribute to the number in 2025 being slightly down from the $53.8 billion, but they also represent, as I mentioned, what we believe is required to kind of get the work done that we need to get done. And so those numbers will increase. There are lots of puts and takes, as you know, through an annual expense forecast, right, including, as you would expect, we've got volume, we’ve got revenue growth here that's going to come with volume growth. Volume, incentive comp, there's merit increases that go with that. And then we also have a series of productivity actions that are playing through to offset those headwinds, whether it be the additional carryover from the org simplification and full year impact of that, or some of the Legacy/stranded coming down. And so there are puts and takes, but Transformation and technology specifically, we are continuing to invest in, in order to achieve what we need to get done here and also ensure the businesses have what they need to drive sustainable growth going forward. MATT O’","billion, revenue",yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q4,Connor,"And I guess, like how do you know that the recent increase that you're modeling internally in these areas, how do you know you're spending enough and in the right ways to address your goals in the Transformation and also satisfy the regulatory requirements?",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q4,Jane Fraser,"Well, if I jump in, I feel very confident indeed that we know what we need to do. We know what we need to be spending on. Through the annual planning process that that concluded last month, it was clear we did need to invest more. We increased the scope of some of the work on the data front. We brought some other work forward. We looked at what we needed to do on the technology front and some of the critical investments. So this is pretty forensic and when we're looking at Transformation, we're looking at technology, we know what our target states need to be, and we know what we need to do to get there and the outcomes we need to be delivering. So we've got our arms around this, and I think you're hearing that confidence from us around what we need to do. We know the investments we need to make. You know what the outcomes and the benefits for shareholders and the regulatory side need to be.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q4,Operator,"Our next question comes from the line of Saul Martinez with HSBC. Your line is now open, please go ahead.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q4,Saul Martinez,"Mark, the NII ex-Markets outlook, if I just take the fourth quarter and annualize that, I get to something in the neighborhood of, I think, around $47.4 billion, $47.5 billion which is above the full year 2024 level. I'm not sure exactly what “up modestly” means, if that's 1%, 3%, 4%, but, and correct me if you think I’m wrong, but it seems like maybe there's a little bit of conservatism built in? If you can just comment on how you think, and how we should think about the quarterly trajectory of NI ex-Markets? Obviously, there's a day count issue in 1Q, but maybe how do you think through like, how we should expect that NII to evolve over the course of the year?",billion,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q4,Mark Mason,"I mean, why don't I just kind of cut to the chase on it a little bit, Saul, in the sense that, “up modestly”, call it a couple of percentage points, 2 to 3 percentage points or so, right, in terms of how I think about it. And I think I've taken, I’ve gone through kind of the tailwinds and headwinds, so I won't kind of take you through that again. But I think the important takeaway should be that we're going to see continued momentum across the franchise driven by loan growth in the Branded Card side of the business and continued deposit momentum, particularly operating deposits in Services. And we're going to do everything that we always do around the management of pricing, and we'll get a benefit from how we've been managing our investment portfolio as those things mature. The combination of those efforts will offset, more than offset some of the headwinds that you'd expect in a declining rate environment, and modestly is, call it, 2% to 3%.",loan growth,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q4,Saul Martinez,"Okay. Fair enough. And then on the expense outlook getting to below $53 billion in 2026, I know that's consistent with what you've said in the past, does imply a pretty sharp reduction in 2026, especially in light of continued revenue growth, it's pretty material operating leverage. Just I mean, how much benefit do you get from a more normalized severance? In other words, how much are we thinking about severance coming down? What's sort of the impact or how to think about the Legacy, stranded costs coming down? Just maybe a little bit more meat on the bone in terms of how much these items will benefit 2026 versus 2025?","billion, revenue",no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q4,Mark Mason,"Look, a couple of things. As I look at our severance costs, which, as I mentioned, has been running high, it was $700 million, we're forecasting $600 million in 2025. I think kind of normal through the cycle is probably, call it, $300 million or so. And so that gives you some sense for that. I think the other thing is, if you look at the other page, and again, there are a number of drivers or levers that we intend to pull to bring that down. But in the All Other page where you look to the right, we show wind-downs and what's remaining in terms of Legacy Franchise. If you add those numbers together, $1.9 billion or so of expenses and think about a subset of that being stranded. And we're going to continue to focus on how do we bring down stranded costs over the next couple of years. So those are two important factors or contributors to the decline from the slightly lower than $53.8 billion to the $53 billion. There are additional productivity saves from prior investments that we've made. But those are important factors. And then as we look at the Transformation spend, that will continue to, or start to pay dividends or help to bring down costs as well. So you've got really those four variables that contribute to us bringing that number down. And as Jane has mentioned, we're going to even post 2026, continue to bring, or drive out more inefficiencies around the organization to fund required investments for the business growth and all with a continued focus on getting to less than 60% as we exit 2026, less than 60% operating efficiency.","billion, million",yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,

2024,Q4,Mike Mayo,"Hi, this is your first full year of having the five line of business structure. So, Mark, do you still have the same line of business targets that you had last year? And Jane, with all the, it must have been a degree of hell to organize this way, get rid of your two intercompany holding companies, eliminate five layers of management, expand span of control and you guys went through a lot last year. And I'm just wondering, is the worst over in terms of that kind of reorganization internally and the culture and the sentiment and how you see that continuing? But first, the concrete question about the targets, please.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q4,Mark Mason,"So I guess I'll start first. So in terms of the targets, look, we set the targets across each of the lines of business for the medium term. We've obviously brought down the 2026 to 10% to 11%. And so you'd imagine there's some movement, at least for the 2026 in terms of those targets, Banking will likely be a little bit lower than the mid-15%, if I think about 2026 as being that medium-term target date. But over time, I expect that the targets that I've set are the targets that we will achieve and even more because, as Jane mentioned, 10% to 11%, while that's our 2026 target, it is not our longer-term target as we think about RoTCE and the strength of these businesses in the aggregate franchise. So hopefully, that answers your question.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q4,Jane Fraser,"And in terms of org simplification, culture, the best is still ahead,that is for sure. The org went through a lot. I'm really proud of how people responded. And I think we're really proud of how each of the lines of business are driving the business performance forward. The bank is simpler. There is tremendous transparency for our investors as well as for me. There's much greater proximity to the businesses now. And you can see that the benefits that we're starting to realize from the strategy as we get closer and closer to the RoTCE targets and beyond for each of the businesses. So I'm pleased to have 2024 behind us. I'm proud of what we achieved in 2024. All the focus is on the future. Onwards.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
