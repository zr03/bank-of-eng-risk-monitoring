      "Ken Usdin (Analyst): Thanks. Hey, Mark, just a follow-up on the credit. So you mentioned obviously that you moved your part of your Current Expected Credit Losses adjustment a little bit in your weightings, and you had previously talked about getting towards normalized card losses, I think you'd said by around the end of the year. So can you just given the changes that we're seeing ahead of us and definitely saw some normalization happen this quarter, can you just, are you still on line for that getting to that 3-3.5% and 5-5.5% in the respective card businesses by around year-end this year?\n",
      "Mark Mason (CFO): Yeah, year-end, early next year, yes. We're still kind of on track, on trend for that. Again, I'd expect that they pick up a little bit after that before they start tapering down. But the answer to your question, Ken, is yes. That's still the timeline, fourth quarter, early 2024 reaching those normalized levels.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 1, Justification: The CFO directly confirms the timeline for reaching normalized card losses, explicitly stating \"yes\" and reiterating \"year-end, early next year\" and \"fourth quarter, early 2024.\" The response directly addresses the analyst's question without vagueness or deflection.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Matt O'Connor (Analyst): Hello. You guys have talked about bending the curve on costs I think in the latter part of 2024, and I wanted to see if that's still the case. And I guess maybe just some clarification on what bending the curve means. Is that slowing expense growth, absolute drop, any kind of clarity on that, and costs in general kind of medium-term would be helpful. Thank you.\n",
      "Mark Mason (CFO): Thank, Matt. To answer your question very directly, yes, it is still the case. We are going to bend the curve, as I mentioned, towards the end of 2024. It does mean an absolute dollar reduction in expenses.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 1, Justification: The CFO directly confirms that 'bending the curve' is still the case for late 2024. Furthermore, he explicitly clarifies that it means an 'absolute dollar reduction in expenses,' directly addressing the analyst's request for definition. The answer is clear and specific.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Jim Mitchell (Analyst): Yeah, all fair. And then maybe as a follow-up, just, you mentioned increased macro assumptions embedded in reserves. Where are you now on the macro assumptions in the reserve book?\n",
      "Mark Mason (CFO): So in terms of the reserve, again, remember we have a couple of different scenarios that we run when we calculate the Current Expected Credit Losses reserves. Our current reserves are based on those three macroeconomic scenarios. It reflects a 5.1% or so unemployment rate on a weighted basis over eight quarters, so that's relatively flat versus last quarter.\n",
      "The other point worth mentioning is that in this particular calculation for the quarter, we did skew a little bit more towards the downside in terms of the probability weighting than last quarter, in light of the macro environment and the combination of that as well as some normalization in the portfolio including an increase in revolver activity contributed to the increase in reserves we saw.\n",
      "But to answer your question, unemployment at about 5.1% for the weighted basis over the eight quarters.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 1, Justification: The CFO directly answers the question by providing a specific macroeconomic assumption (5.1% unemployment rate over eight quarters) embedded in the reserves. He also offers additional relevant context regarding the probability weighting of downside scenarios, further clarifying the macro assumptions.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Mike Mayo (Analyst): Hi. Just one clarification on that last answer. You said you had intra-quarter flows. Did you gain more deposits in the month of March, and was that in the US?\n",
      "Mark Mason (CFO): Yes, that's what I was talking about, Mike, in terms of those flows. They did come largely in the US in the month of March, call it March 8th through kind of the end of March. They were overshadowed by these normal payments that I referenced, and we did, we still see good activity kind of even as we came through March and into early parts of April.\n",
      "Jane Fraser (CEO): And that was both in the Institutional business that we saw the inflows as well as in PBWM.\n",
      "Mark Mason (CFO): Yes, in Wealth.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 1, Justification: The management directly confirmed intra-quarter deposit gains in March and specified that these flows were largely in the US, explicitly answering both parts of the analyst's question. Additional details were provided regarding the timeframe and business segments, further clarifying the situation without evading the query.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Vivek Juneja (Analyst): And just as a clarification, with the inflows you've seen recently in deposits with the crisis, this is in the US, obviously, are the betas tempering a little bit, how much those are going up? Is that slowing down, or not any change so far?\n",
      "Mark Mason (CFO): So a couple things I mentioned. So one, we did see inflows in the quarter associated with some of the sector turmoil. We've looked at kind of deposit levels from call it March 7th, March 8th through close to the end of March, and we certainly did see an uptick, call it probably a little bit under $30 billion or so of inflows in that period of time, with a good portion of that in our Citi Commercial Bank, our Commercial Middle-Market client base.\n",
      "It's too soon to tell kind of how betas evolve, but we do think that a good portion of those deposits will likely be sticky. I think what's important here is that part of our strategy here is in fact growing operating deposits with our large multinational clients and our middle-market clients, and so we're going to continue to be focused on that.\n",
      "What's a little bit unclear is how the rate environment continues to evolve and what that means for how betas actually evolve, and we'll have to kind of wait and see. It's too soon to tell as it relates to that.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 3, Justification: The CFO directly addresses the first part of the question regarding deposit inflows, providing specific figures and sources. However, for the core question about deposit betas tempering, the response explicitly states, \"It's too soon to tell\" and that it's \"unclear how the rate environment continues to evolve.\" While acknowledging the question, the answer defers providing a direct response regarding betas, thus only partially addressing the inquiry.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Glenn Schorr (Analyst): So, I'm very curious on the whole revenue to Risk-Weighted Assets topic, especially with some of the changes coming in. So maybe you could give a little more color on -- let's take, for instance, the further reduction in subscription credit facilities. I think I read somewhere that was like an $80 billion book down to $20 billion. You can correct that if that's wrong. But just usually, those things are big important clients that have relationship lending, things attached to them. So, I'm curious on how you balance the capital benefit, the clear capital benefit, versus client impact and how you think about that? Are there other blocks of business that are in motion right now?\n",
      "Mark Mason (CFO): Thanks Glenn and good morning, and thanks for the question. Look, a couple of points on that. One is we've been very focused on the revenue to Risk-Weighted Assets metric in our Markets business in the ICG more broadly as well. And we've made considerable progress on that. And that's important because how we use the balance sheet and ensuring that we're optimizing the use of the balance sheet contributes to how we improve returns over time.\n",
      "You're right to point out the subscription facility, credit facility, lending that we do. We brought that down pretty significantly. The numbers you highlight are a lot higher than the portfolio. But what's important here is that as we look at that, we look at a couple of things. So, one, the nature of relationship and whether clients are taking advantage of the breadth of what we have to offer. Two, the profitability and returns associated with the product to the extent that it is in a broader relationship, and where those returns are low, subpar, and the prospect for doing more has proven to be fruitless, we take it down. And that's what we've done with a large part of that book, just as we juxtapose it against other opportunities to use balance sheet where clients are taking advantage of the broader franchise and therefore, are generating higher returns.\n",
      "And we're going to continue to do that. We've done that to drive the revenue to Risk-Weighted Assets metric. We've done it selectively on pieces of the portfolio like SCF. We've also looked at our broader corporate lending portfolio and where those promises for higher relationship returns aren't manifesting themselves, we've not renewed those loans. And as we think about pending regulatory changes, proactively making these efforts becomes critically important. When I look back on the activity that we've done over the past couple of years, we've reduced Risk-Weighted Assets by approximately $120 billion over the last 2 years, and about 75% of that is predominantly driven by balance sheet optimization and looking at client activity that has low margin business. And so, this is important for us to do and to keep doing.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 2, Justification: The CFO mostly addresses the question by explaining the criteria used to balance capital benefit and client impact for the subscription credit facilities (relationship depth and profitability). They also explicitly mention other areas of the corporate lending portfolio undergoing similar RWA optimization. The only minor vagueness is not providing the exact corrected figure for the SCF book size, stating only that the analyst's number was 'a lot higher'.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Vivek Juneja (Analyst): Thank you. Thanks for taking my questions, Mark and Jane. Mark, I want to go to your revenue, I hear you, you're keeping the revenue guidance unchanged. What is in your revenue assumption, just want to unpeel that onion a little bit. What's in your revenue assumption for rates, US and internationally, and what is going on with deposit betas particularly following the inflows you've seen recently in the US with the crisis?\n",
      "Mark Mason (CFO): Yeah, so, I guess a couple things. One, in terms of the rates that we've assumed, in the balance of the year, we've kind of assumed that rates would flatten out after this quarter, after this second quarter and then trend down a bit towards the end of the year. Down a bit to something like 4.50% or so, so we may have one rate increase and then flat and then down to about 4.50%. That could change, but candidly, if it changes a little bit here or there, it's unlikely to have a meaningful impact in 2023. That's likely to have more of an impact in 2024. So we can debate that curve, but that's kind of what we have thus far in our outlook. And that’s US rates.\n",
      "The second point I'd make is around non-US rates. We're assuming, I don't have specifics in front of me in terms of the rate curves around the globe, but we are assuming continued rate increases there. Not of a significant magnitude, but some assumptions there depending on where we're talking about.\n",
      "The beta assumptions that we have built in are for betas to continue to increase outside of the US, but again, they run lower than the US in general for our multinational clients. We expect that we will see in the PBWM Retail Banking, or the PBWM client segment space that clients are likely to move towards either higher-yielding deposit products or investment products, and so we've factored those things into how we think about the outlook. And could that change or evolve? Absolutely. But that's kind of what's behind what we've assumed here.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 2, Justification: The CFO directly addresses the assumptions for US rates with specific numbers and trends, and provides a general direction for international rates. While he explains the expected client shift towards higher-yielding deposit products impacting betas, he is slightly less explicit in connecting it directly to the recent US inflows post-crisis.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Jim Mitchell (Analyst): Maybe just getting on the expense side. You're keeping Mexico until 2025 now at the earliest. So that will be on the books longer. How do we think about that bend the curve discussion? And maybe specifically, you can help us think about bending the curve for the non-legacy businesses. Do we start to see is the fourth quarter just a slowing or quarterly decline? Is it a year-over-year kind of a discussion? I just want to make sure I understand the whole bend the curve notion and how to think about that.\n",
      "Mark Mason (CFO): Thank you. Let me take that. I'd say a couple of things. So, one, I'd reiterate the expense guidance that we've given for the full year. So that's the roughly $54 billion ex-divestitures, or the impact of divestitures, ex-any impact from Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation special assessment. Two, as we think about bending the curve, I look into 2024 and we're looking to bring the absolute expense dollars down from Q3 to Q4. So that bending of the curve will occur. It will occur despite having Mexico still part of the franchise. And obviously still having Mexico impacts the magnitude of the bend, but it will bend Q3 to Q4.\n",
      "And then beyond that and through the medium term, we will see the curve continue to bend. Again, Mexico impacts the magnitude of the bend, but we're very, very focused on bringing our costs down and bending that curve. And you've heard us reference the aspects or the elements of our business that help contribute to that, not the least of which are the exits, one of which is Mexico, and you referenced the timing there, but also the benefits from investments that we've been making in transformation and risk controls and shifting from manual processes to technology-enabled ones.\n",
      "And then the final one is around simplifying our organization. And you heard in Jane's prepared remarks, as we continue to make progress on these exits, it opens up the opportunity for us to lean more heavily into that simplification. So, we are focused on not only the guidance, but the bending of the curve as you point out and looking forward to delivering that and taking actions to ensure we do.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 2, Justification: The CFO directly addressed the overall expense curve bending from Q3 to Q4 and acknowledged Mexico's impact on the magnitude of the bend. However, the response did not specifically address the analyst's query about how to think about bending the curve for \"non-legacy businesses,\" which was a key part of the question. It also didn't explicitly clarify the \"year-over-year\" expense discussion.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Mike Mayo (Analyst): Hi, Jane, I challenged you a couple earnings calls ago about the complexity created by being in so many countries, and you said Treasury and Trade Solutions was your crown jewel, and here it's up almost one-third year-over-year, so, so far so good since your Investor Day.\n",
      "Can you talk about for the fee growth? I mean, we kind of understand the Net Interest Income growth, but the fee growth is double-digits also, so I guess that's money in motion and I think you described this as the world's largest wholesale global payments system. What's happening to give you double-digit top line growth there?\n",
      "Jane Fraser (CEO): Oh, thank you, Mike, and a great question. I think one of the numbers I'm almost more happy about than the stellar revenue growth was the fee growth quarter-over-quarter here because obviously, we've been benefiting in Treasury and Trade Solutions from the rates environment but we've also been benefiting from the drivers behind the franchise. And the fee revenues are coming from multiple different products and different offerings that we have here, and we're typically looking and have consistently looked at growing our fee revenue as a percentage of the underlying growth in Treasury and Trade Solutions.\n",
      "It got masked a bit when the rates environment was growing so much, but the different areas there around the world are making a big difference to the strength of our earnings and the quality of our earnings in these areas.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 4, Justification: The CEO's response confirms the strong fee growth but avoids providing specific details or examples of the products, offerings, or drivers contributing to the double-digit increase. Instead, the answer uses general statements like \"multiple different products and different offerings\" and \"drivers behind the franchise,\" failing to directly explain \"what's happening\" with concrete information as requested by the analyst.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Steven Chubak (Analyst): That's great. And for my follow-up, just on PBWM fee income trends, I'm not going to ask you about the broader Wealth strategy, but we're big fans of Andy here, so congrats on the hire. The one thing I did want to get a better sense of is how much of the sequential improvement that we saw in fees is a function of just partner payments being higher as credit continues to normalize, and how we should be thinking about the trajectory in fees within PBWM over the remainder of this year?\n",
      "Mark Mason (CFO): I think there are a couple of things to kind of keep in mind in terms of PBWM fees, and I think part of it is that PBWM is a combination of both the Cards business as well as the Wealth business, and a good amount of the pressure that we've seen in fees and that is still subject to how the environment evolves is in the Wealth space, because we continue to see fee pressure on investment activity and revenues there, and we'll have to see how the market valuations move on some of the assets that we manage on behalf of clients and what momentum it drives in terms of more investment activity. So I think that's a big part of the drag in fees.\n",
      "The upside that we've seen in fees in Banking and Cards, again, I think will be subject to how activity and volume evolves across our Cards business. We do expect revolving levels to continue, but purchase sales while they're up year-over-year, when we look at kind of the latter months of the quarter, the growth has been slowing, and has been quite concentrated in travel and entertainment. So we'll have to see how some of that volume activity evolves, and that'll be a factor to keep in mind.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 5, Justification: The CFO's response completely avoids the specific question about how much of the sequential improvement in fees was due to partner payments. Furthermore, instead of providing a clear trajectory for PBWM fees, the answer offers highly conditional and uncertain statements, deferring to market conditions and activity evolution without offering specific guidance or quantification.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Betsy Graseck (Analyst): Hi, good morning. I know during the prepared remarks you talked a bit about Andy Sieg coming on board, and I just wanted to understand how to think about the outlook for what you're doing with Wealth, not only in the US but the non-US locations, and also try to understand how much capital you think you could apply to that business relative to what you have today. Thanks.\n",
      "Jane Fraser (CEO): Hey there Betsy. So, we're obviously delighted that Andy is joining as our new Global Head of Wealth around my table, and he's a tremendous leader with a great track record driving growth. He's got deep product and digital expertise; a proven people leader and we'll certainly be taking full advantage of his expertise and experience in the US.\n",
      "We're not shifting our strategy in Wealth. His mandate is consistent with the strategy we laid out at Investor Day. We see a lot of potential of growth in Asia as we fill in the coverage across the full wealth spectrum there. We'll be scaling up in the US by building out the investment offering and cross-selling into our existing and new clients across the country. We see tremendous potential of growth in our Private Bank and the family office franchise really around the world, and there's a lot of synergies to be realized as we point out in the different KPIs and drivers between the other four core businesses in terms of referrals and other business that we're able to generate across the franchise.\n",
      "So the core of the strategy will not be changing with him coming on board. Mark, what else would you add in?\n",
      "Mark Mason (CFO): The only thing I'd add is that, we are, I think, well-positioned for as the market recovers and it plays towards Wealth. When you look at kind of the client advisors, as you know, we've been investing in bringing on new client advisors. We've been increasing the number of new clients that we've been onboarding as well. We've invested in some of the investment products that we have, and so I feel like we are positioning ourselves for when this turns.\n",
      "And as it relates to your question regarding capital, this in a normal cycle is a very healthy returning business, and as the market turns and as we recover, we would look to deploy capital appropriate with the growth and return prospects that we see in front of us.\n",
      "It's also not as much of a capital-intensive business as other businesses, and so I think you've got to keep both of those things in mind.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 4, Justification: The management provided a general overview of the wealth management strategy and growth potential, which partially addressed the outlook question. However, they clearly avoided the specific quantitative aspect of 'how much capital' they could apply to the business relative to current levels, instead offering qualitative statements about capital deployment principles and the business's capital intensity.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Betsy Graseck (Analyst): I just wanted to confirm on the Common Equity Tier 1. You know you have the 100-basis point buffer on top of regulatory minimums. So that would suggest that the 13.3% that you got this quarter is in-line with where you're planning on holding it going forward, is that fair?\n",
      "Mark Mason (CFO): So, you're right, we hit 13.3% this quarter, down a tad bit from the 13.4% last quarter. Effective October 1, the 4.3% SCB comes into play. And so that would equate to, assuming the 100-basis point management buffer, a 12.3% regulatory requirement and a 13.3% kind of target that we would manage to.\n",
      "I'd highlight a couple of things that I'm sure are obvious to you, Betsy. One is this is the stress capital buffer for the 12-month period starting October 1. And two is the strategy that we've described and talked about and have started to execute against is intentionally designed to help morph the business towards a more steady, predictable, consistent stream of revenues, fee revenue growth as well bring our expenses down over time, and exit these markets, and those things should contribute to reducing our stress capital buffer over time and improving our returns. But the answer to your question very directly is, yes, the 13.3% would reflect where we'd be targeting as of October 1 for now.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 1, Justification: The CFO directly confirmed that 13.3% is the target CET1 ratio, clarifying it's based on the new regulatory requirements and their 100-basis point buffer. The response was clear, specific, and provided a direct 'yes' to the analyst's question, fully addressing the inquiry.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Glenn Schorr (Analyst): I appreciate that. Maybe if I could follow-up on your comments, the previous ones on Treasury and Trade Solutions and Securities Services. I try to learn from all my mistakes, I make a lot of them, but in 2008 we thought housing prices couldn't go down much, and then they went down a lot, and we all adapt. The same thing in March, thought deposits couldn't leave a bank so quickly, but they did.\n",
      "So, slide 25 and 26 people should look at because they're great and they show the stability of your deposit franchise, but I'm curious if history can change at all. Meaning right now, those are cash and operating deposits that clients keep with you and they need you, and you're fully integrated, but do you have client concentrations we should know about or are you thinking about any big changes that can happen in terms of client behavior relative to the past in terms of what they keep at any given bank? I know it's a tough one.\n",
      "Jane Fraser (CEO): Glenn, I'll kick it off and pass it over to Mark. I feel very comfortable about how very well-diversified our deposit base is across different countries, industries, clients, and currencies. It's extremely strong in that respect, and as you say, the majority of the Institutional deposits are integrated into the operating accounts all around the world to enable the clients to run their day-to-day operations, the payroll, the working capital, the supplier financing, et cetera.\n",
      "And I think what's changed in the more digital world is frankly these have become even stickier because the amount of data, the extent of integration into the technology platforms and systems of the clients and the value that we extract and present back to the clients from the combination of our Foreign Exchange trade, cash, et cetera, flows, is incredibly important in driving their efficiency, their risk management, and their financial performance as well. So both the extent of that diversification and the increasing stickiness versus history is something that we're certainly not complacent about, but I think is why you see from the pages we've put into the deck as well including in the back on just the consistency of this base.\n",
      "Mark, what would you add?\n",
      "Mark Mason (CFO): I think that's exactly right, Jane, and Glenn, I'm glad you pointed out pages 25 and 26 which clearly lay out that diversification but also the scale and stability of those deposits over an extended period of time.\n",
      "The only thing I'd add additional to that would be obviously we're in an environment where there's quantitative tightening that's occurring. That's going to have a broad industry impact as we've started to see already, but we're also in an environment where rates are increasing. We'll see how that plays out through the balance of the year. That has an impact on betas, but we shouldn't mistake price-sensitivity or interest rate sensitivity with the stickiness of the deposits. And so we've obviously talked about betas increasing particularly in our Treasury and Trade Solutions portfolio, more so in the US. It obviously will continue to increase outside of the US, but we'll work the relationship that we have with those clients and the breadth of services that we bring to influence and impact pricing, and more importantly, because of the operating nature of them, we do see them as very stable.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 2, Justification: The management directly addressed the analyst's concerns about deposit concentrations by stating the base is \"very well-diversified\" and about client behavior by asserting deposits are becoming \"even stickier\" and \"very stable\" due to integration. While specific client concentration data was not provided, the overall message was clear and responsive to the spirit of the question.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Jim Mitchell (Analyst): Hey, good morning. Maybe just a question on capital. Appreciate the fact that the potential sale of the Mexico franchise would be a negative impact, but you're sitting at a pretty comfortable cushion now above your target. Obviously your expected future retained earnings growth should be more than an offset, so how do we think about, how are you thinking about the timing of restarting buybacks with your stock as cheap as it is?\n",
      "Mark Mason (CFO): Yeah, thanks, Jim, and good morning. As you point out, we grew capital pretty sizably this quarter, up to 13.4% from a Common Equity Tier 1 ratio point of view and up significantly from a year ago, some 200 basis points or so. And a good portion of that, a significant portion of that, was really net income earnings generation, which is important.\n",
      "Look, the way we think about it is that 13.4%, we certainly have well-above what's required from a regulatory point of view and it includes our internal management buffer of about 100 basis points. But as we've said in the past, there is certainly the Mexico transaction and that would be a temporary drag to Common Equity Tier 1 at signing, the difference between signing and closing if it were a sale to take place. And then there are a couple of other factors that are out there as well.\n",
      "So think about the Basel III end game that's out there and the capital requirements that could come out of that. Think about the Comprehensive Capital Analysis Dodd-Frank Act Stress Test that has been submitted and currently under review, and what that might mean for stress capital buffers, and also think about just where we are in the broader economy and broader global macro environment that we're playing in and needing to see how that kind of evolves. And so when I think about all of those factors, we're in a place where we will continue to take it quarter-by-quarter, but I'd end by saying our bias is kind of where yours is, which is given where we're trading, all things being equal, we'd like to be buying back shares, but we have to be responsible about that and the timing of that.\n",
      "Jane Fraser (CEO): I think we'll have more clarity fairly soon around a number of the factors, so we'll be able to give you better clarity on timing before too long.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 4, Justification: The management avoids providing a clear timeline for restarting buybacks. While acknowledging the desire to buy back shares, they deflect the specific question about timing by citing various external uncertainties such as the Mexico transaction, Basel III, CCAR, and the broader macro environment. They defer the timing decision to a quarter-by-quarter review and promise clarity \"before too long,\" which is not a direct answer to the current timing.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Erika Najarian (Analyst): Hi. Good morning. And I think it's remarkable that your first two questions were essentially saying that your revenues are too conservative, so that's very notable for a Citi call.\n",
      "My first question is a follow-up to Betsy. I think everybody were certainly impressed, Jane, at the Andy Sieg hire, and clearly, he was running a much larger business than what Citi has today. And this is sort of a tricky question. Clearly, you're still working through some of the transformation. There's still a consent order, but given your strength as a global player, could Citi participate in perhaps inorganic opportunities that could be out there, having a result perhaps of the liquidity crisis that we saw that could potentially enhance your Wealth Management footprint more quickly?\n",
      "Jane Fraser (CEO): We see plenty of potential for organic growth potential, and I think that's really where we're going to be focusing, Erika, because I look at the Private Bank and the family office, there is so much wealth creation supplemented by our Commercial Banking relationships with a lot of the enterprises and the owners of those enterprises who are really generating the new industry champions in country after country, and we're extremely well-positioned to capture that.\n",
      "I don't see an inorganic play that would actually help us on it. We also benefit because we don't have our own proprietary products and a sales force pushing those proprietary products. We're an open architecture, and therefore, we're a very desirable partner for many of our key partners on the Institutional side of the business to be able to provide very interesting value propositions, investment opportunities and the like to our clients around the world.\n",
      "And finally, we can see certainly areas in interesting digital plays, different partnerships, areas like that that are of interest. So I'll never say never in the longer-run. I'm sure if something very attractive comes up, we'll be very interested and looking at it, but it's not something right now that I think makes sense, given where we're focused. Actually almost independent of the consent orders, I think what we're looking at doing right now is getting this organic play right and then we'll see from there.\n",
      "Mark Mason (CFO): I think it’s pretty telling that we have 13,000 referrals from our Retail Bank to the Wealth space or to our Wealth business, and there's a lot of embedded opportunity and it really speaks to the integrated model that we've been talking about.\n",
      "Jane Fraser (CEO): And I think the other bit I'd also just point to is I think one of the things we do benefit from is that we aren't constrained by being dominated by a brokerage model in a particular way of doing Wealth, so part of the mandate for Andy and the ones that we've been working on to date is really looking at what is modern Wealth Management and making sure that we are really well-positioned that way, because I do think that will be more of the way of the future.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 2, Justification: The CEO directly addresses the question by stating that inorganic plays do not make sense right now, and their current focus is on organic growth. While this provides a clear answer, a significant portion of the response, including the CFO's contribution, elaborates on their organic strategies and internal initiatives, which pivots the conversation away from the specifics of inorganic opportunities.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Mike Mayo (Analyst): Okay. And then as it relates to rates generally, what is it, like, over 90% of your rate sensitivity is outside the US, and so shouldn't you be benefiting more than you originally thought given some of these rate hikes? And I guess, Mark, are you just sandbagging a little bit? I get the uncertainties and the Investment Banking Return on Average Tangible Common Equity: Return on Average Tangible backlog pushed out, and, no I mean, we want you to have a reasonable bar to jump over and I'm just wondering if you set the bar high enough for yourself for this year.\n",
      "Mark Mason (CFO): Yeah, so again, I think that there is certainly more opportunity in terms of how rates move and capturing Net Interest Income as you pointed out outside of the US. We articulate our interest rate exposure for a parallel shift and that mix at the end of last year was the 90/10 that you mentioned for non-US. As I sit here in March, it probably is going to skew a little bit less non-US and a little bit more towards the US, and you'll see that in the 10-Q.\n",
      "With that said, I mentioned earlier, there's still a bit of uncertainty in terms of how rates continue to evolve here in the US. We'll see how betas evolve. We've reached terminal betas in the US with our clients kind of at the end of last year, and so we'll see kind of what happens in terms of pricing through the balance of 2023.\n",
      "Betas are not quite at terminal levels outside of the US, and so we'll see the pacing of that, again, in light of how the interest rate curve may be evolving and frankly in light of how we've seen the broader sector turmoil play out. That could in fact play to our benefit. But we are also, again, in an environment where there's quantitative tightening that is still at play.\n",
      "And then the final point I'd make, Mike, that often people forget is that in that Net Interest Income is Legacy Net Interest Income, and so as we continue with our wind-downs, our divestitures, et cetera, that's going to be a headwind that we will have to deal with.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 4, Justification: The CFO acknowledges the opportunity from rate sensitivity outside the US but then immediately introduces several uncertainties and headwinds (e.g., US rate evolution, beta dynamics, quantitative tightening, legacy NII) that complicate a direct answer. He avoids directly addressing the analyst's pointed question about 'sandbagging' or whether they should be benefiting 'more than originally thought,' instead providing a detailed, albeit cautious, overview of NII drivers.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Ebrahim Poonawala (Analyst): Hey, good afternoon. Just a couple of quick questions. One, in terms of the Banamex sale, I think, Jane, you mentioned that maybe we might hear something relatively soon and you still are pursuing the dual track process. One, if you do decide to go the IPO route, does that change the accounting dynamics, Mark, with regards to taking that hit early on if given just the time it might take to go through an IPO. And the outlook for the Mexican economy, the banks continue to be robust. Is that impacting or influencing how you're thinking about the value that you should get from this transaction?\n",
      "Jane Fraser (CEO): So, we're in a very active dialogue right now in Mexico, so neither Mark nor I are going to comment in a lot of detail there. As you say, we're continuing to pursue a dual path, both a sale and an IPO, so we'll have an exit strategy either way, and we'll take the path that is in the best interest of our shareholders.\n",
      "So we've got an enormous body of work going on in Mexico to separate out the Institutional business. I'm pleased with the progress they're making. I think we're seeing, when we look at the performance of our Mexican franchise, a lot of the really strong performance is happening in our ICG business where Mexico is such a beneficiary of the supply chain dynamics that are happening around the world, and its location is obviously very beneficial given the proximity to the US as well. So I think a lot of the dynamic and the big benefits here coming in the institutional franchise that we're keeping within Citi as a core part of our business.\n",
      "So the current Mexican economy doesn't really have so much of an impact on our current decision-making. The principle is we will take the path that is in the best interest of our shareholders.\n",
      "Mark Mason (CFO): Yeah, and just to put some numbers to that, for the quarter, Mexico was up 16% revenue year-over-year. Quarter-over-quarter up 5%, cards growth, deposit growth, so performing well I would say.\n",
      "And in terms of the latter part of your question, Jane's exactly right. Everything we're doing is positioning us for both a private sale and/or an IPO, and we'll choose the path that's best for shareholders. An IPO would take longer. It would likely take longer as we would want a set of full audited financials, et cetera. I would say that in terms of what the implications would be from an accounting point of view, Cumulative Translation Adjustment accounting is different for an IPO so we would not recognize that Cumulative Translation Adjustment through the P&L in an IPO. We wouldn't have at signing that impact that is different from that closing and so that would not be an issue.\n",
      "The impact would be a matter of how much we IPO-ed at that time, so a lot of moving pieces there. We would need to figure out if we ended up down that path, but hopefully that gives you some sense of the scenarios there.\n",
      "But I'd end with just one final point that Jane has made already, which is that the outcome that we choose will be the best outcome for our shareholders, our clients, and employees.\n",
      "Jane Fraser (CEO): And that will be an exit.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 2, Justification: The management team mostly addresses the analyst's questions. Mark Mason provides a direct and specific answer regarding the Cumulative Translation Adjustment accounting for an IPO, clarifying that the expected 'hit' would not be recognized in the P&L. Jane Fraser also directly states that the Mexican economy doesn't significantly impact their current decision-making on value, though both executives frame their answers with general statements about shareholder best interests and the ongoing dual-track process.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Glenn Schorr (Analyst): I appreciate that, Mark. Maybe just a quick follow-up. On Net Interest Income, I asked this last quarter too. And your first half annualized ex-Markets is running about $1.5 billion ahead of the guide. Is that just unpredictable nature all the moving parts, trying to be conservative or anything else in the back half that you're thinking about?\n",
      "Mark Mason (CFO): Thanks, Glenn. We did take guidance up to slightly above $46 billion from the $45 billion. I guess there are a couple of things, and that’s ex-Markets, of course. There are a couple of things to think about in terms of headwinds and tailwinds that play through there. One is you've heard me mention before that we've reached terminal betas in the U.S. Two, deposit volumes and the shift mix as we see consumers kind of move into higher-returning type, higher-yielding type products. And three, really the wind-downs and the exits and the reduction that they will play out in terms of Net Interest Income. So those are kind of 3 headwinds as we think about the forecast and the balance of year. There are obviously some potential tailwinds that play to the other side, including rate movements in non-U.S. dollar as well as Card volume growth. And as we look at those headwinds and tailwinds, our current read is to take it up, but $46 billion or slightly above that feels like the right level in the context of total revenues at $78 billion to $79 billion.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 4, Justification: The CFO acknowledges the NII increase and provides a new guidance with a general list of headwinds and tailwinds impacting it. However, the answer avoids directly addressing the analyst's core question about why the first half NII ran significantly ahead of the previous guide, specifically whether it was due to unpredictable factors or conservatism in the initial forecast.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Matt O'Connor (Analyst): Okay. That's helpful. And then, I think in the past you've kind of insinuated that's like the start of hopefully a more material drop in costs beyond, obviously this is far away, but just any additional color there too. Thank you.\n",
      "Mark Mason (CFO): Yeah, look, again, look, the expense base is a key area of focus for us, right? We recognize that expenses have been growing. They've been growing because we've been investing in the franchise both transformation-wise as well as business-led growth to support the competitive advantages that we have in many of our franchises, but we're managing that very actively and very deliberately, and that means that we're looking to ensure that we're spending the money in the right way in the right places and that we're going to yield the benefits that we expect from that over time. And that was all factored into the targets that we set at our Investor Day for the medium-term, and what that requires is that we start bending the curve in 2024 as I stated and that we end in that medium-term at a place where we have an operating efficiency of about 60% and we're positioned to have returns that are in that 11% to 12% Return on Average Tangible Common Equity point of view.\n",
      "There are a couple of factors that are going to contribute to lowering that expense base. One, the divestitures that we've been talking about, right. The second is the benefits from the transformation and other investments that I've just referenced. And the third is further organizational and management simplification efforts that we have underway that are enabled by the idea that we're exiting 14 consumer countries. And so those three factors, if you will, become very important to ensure that we get to that lower cost structure and that we're able to deliver on the broader commitments that we're making with regards to returns.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 4, Justification: The analyst asked for 'additional color' on the potential for a 'more material drop in costs beyond' current expectations. The CFO’s response reiterates existing medium-term targets for efficiency and return, and lists broad categories of initiatives that are already known contributors to cost reduction. The answer avoids providing specific new insights or addressing the 'insinuation' of a more significant future drop beyond the stated targets, instead redirecting to previously communicated goals and general strategies.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Jim Mitchell (Analyst): So just as a follow-up, is the way to think about sort of 2025 and beyond as you get through a lot the automation on the sort of the non-legacy businesses and start to get much more efficient there. Is there an absolute expense decline story in the core business? Or is that more that you need the top line growth to get the improved returns?\n",
      "Mark Mason (CFO): Again, it's going to be a combination of continuing to bend the curve and bring our expenses down. Obviously, we've given you guidance on operating efficiency of less than 60%, which will be some of that top line growth, but it's the combination of the two.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 2, Justification: The CFO directly addresses the core of the question by stating it will be a \"combination\" of expense reduction and top-line growth. While he mentions \"bring our expenses down,\" he doesn't explicitly confirm an \"absolute expense decline story\" independent of top-line growth, which introduces a minor level of vagueness regarding the precise nature of the expense reduction.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Gerard Cassidy (Analyst): No, very, very insightful. Very good. Thank you. And then as a follow-up question, I noticed in your Card, I think it was slide 8, you give us the prime, 80% of the portfolio is prime, which is Fair Isaacson Company scores greater than 680. I don't know if you would agree with this statement, but we're hearing that there was some Fair Isaacson Company score inflation as a result of the pandemic. A lot of consumers saw their Fair Isaacson Company scores go up, and I've seen numbers as high as 70 points, that may be on the high side, but can you guys, do you agree with that, and if you do, would you then expect the 700 Fair Isaacson Company score customer at some point to behave like a 650 score customer?\n",
      "Jane Fraser (CEO): I think the short answer is no, but let me let Mark answer that one.\n",
      "Mark Mason (CFO): I think what's really important here, Gerard, is kind of what we're seeing in the way of the performance of the portfolio. So again, I've heard that sentiment regarding Fair Isaacson Company score inflation. We feel very confident in how we've assessed our customers and what it means to have 80% of our customers prime and greater than 680. I think importantly, what we're seeing is we're seeing payment rates start to slow. We're seeing average interest-earning balances start to increase. We're seeing Net Credit Loss rates increase, but particularly driven by the lower Fair Isaacson Company score customers across the portfolio which is where you would expect to start to see that drag occur, and the Net Credit Loss rates that we're seeing are still well below what we would see in a normal cycle and they're in line with what we've been forecasting for performance. So there are no surprises that we're seeing in terms of how that curve is evolving. We'd expect that it will get back to those normal levels towards the beginning of next year. It will likely play through those normal levels a bit before tapering.\n",
      "But my point here is that we understand our customers, the portfolio, and how it reacts to the environment enough to forecast that out, and so far, that's been performing in line with that forecast and those estimates. And importantly, we continue to stress it to make sure we're not missing anything and importantly, we carry a sizable reserve, as you know, as part of that $20 billion.\n",
      "Jane Fraser (CEO): I'd also add that we don't just rely on Fair Isaacson Company scores for assessing the credit of our customers and our portfolio. There's a tremendous amount of data that we draw upon that goes well, well beyond that, and that's also, as you can imagine, something that gives a lot more confidence is it's not just prior history, it's a wealth of data that is used.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 2, Justification: The CEO provides a direct \"no\" to the initial question about Fair Isaacson Company score inflation. While the CFO does not explicitly state whether a 700-score customer will behave like a 650, their detailed explanation of portfolio performance, increasing NCLs primarily from lower-score customers, and robust internal assessment processes strongly implies that they do not expect this behavior. The answer provides substantive information, aligning with a \"Mostly Direct\" rating.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Betsy Graseck (Analyst): And since you mentioned you're evaluating buybacks quarter-by-quarter. I guess the question here is, how should I think about that relative to, we get Basel endgame coming out soon because clearly, when you’ re at 13.3% against the new reg cap SCB, you know it signals a bigger opportunity for buybacks over the coming quarters. So how should I think about that?\n",
      "Jane Fraser (CEO): I think that consistent with what we've been talking about, there's a lot of uncertainty out there about the new capital requirements, both in terms of the nature of them and the timing of implementation. I think the industry is expecting to get more clarity about that with the comment period that will be coming up.\n",
      "Plus, it's a fairly uncertain macroeconomic environment at the moment, so both Mark and I feel it's prudent to continue making that assessment until some of this uncertainty is clarified as to what precisely we’ll do.\n",
      "You should take confidence that we're at the levels, including the management buffer that we expect to be for the rest of the year. We've proven a good case of being able to build capital that's for sure over the last 2 years. And you take comfort as well we increased the dividend, we had $2 billion of capital returned last quarter, so our intentions are clear to return capital where we can, but also to be prudent in how we do so, given environment and current regulatory uncertainty.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 4, Justification: The CEO avoids directly addressing how the company plans to approach future buybacks relative to the Basel Endgame regulations and their strong capital position. The response consistently emphasizes general regulatory and macroeconomic uncertainty as the reason for deferring specific plans. While acknowledging the intent to return capital, it provides no concrete forward-looking guidance on buybacks.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Glenn Schorr (Analyst): Hi, thank you, a simple one. I appreciate the many, many moving parts, but your first quarter Net Interest Income and revenue production was great, and if you just annualize it, you're handily ahead of your full year guide. So I'm just curious on how you're thinking about maintaining the guide but running ahead of schedule.\n",
      "Mark Mason (CFO): Yeah, thanks, Glenn, and good morning. Appreciate the question. Look, we did have a very solid first quarter, but as Jane mentioned in her prepared remarks, there are a number of things that are still out there in the global macro environment that are uncertain and unclear, including, frankly, as we contemplate the direction of rates and what's required to tame inflation, let alone the uncertainty that we've seen in parts of the sector here through the quarter.\n",
      "And so when I think about that and I think about how frankly betas have evolved and the likelihood of a recession in the back half of the year, which we have built into our outlook, I remain comfortable with the guidance that we've set here. And when you think about where that comes from, the strength in Treasury and Trade Solutions, the strength in Securities Services, both benefiting from the rate hikes we saw last year, but also deepening relationships with new and existing clients, the Card momentum, which is really about seeing more revolving activity as payment rates start to slow, and the recovery in Investment Banking and Wealth is not as swift as we would like and so we have to see how that plays out too.\n",
      "So when I put those things together, there's certainly some puts and takes that speaks to the diversification of our business model, but it leaves me in a place where I'm comfortable with the guidance that we've set, and if that changes, we'll certainly update you, but that's where we are.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 4, Justification: The CFO acknowledges the strong Q1 but largely avoids directly explaining how the company plans to maintain its full-year guide despite running ahead of schedule. Instead, the response pivots to general global macro uncertainties, future economic risks like a potential H2 recession, and a broad discussion of 'puts and takes' across business segments to justify the current guidance. It provides reasons for conservatism but doesn't directly reconcile the Q1 outperformance with the maintained annual outlook.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Gerard Cassidy (Analyst): Thank you. Hi, Jane. Hi, Mark. A couple questions. Jane, maybe starting with you first, or Mark, both of you can answer it. In view of what the disruptions we've seen in the banking system in the month of March with what went on with the regional banks here in the US and obviously the large investment bank over in Switzerland, do you guys see changes coming, or what changes do you see coming in terms of regulatory whether it's more capital, more liquidity, and it may not be directed at a company like yours because you're a global SIFI already and it might be more regionally orientated in the United States. And as part of this question, Jane, can you guys give us some color on the deposit you and your peers made into First Republic? What was the thinking behind that as well?\n",
      "Jane Fraser (CEO): Sure. Thank you for the question, Gerard. Well, I'd say that we hope that there will be a thoughtful and targeted approach to any changes in the regulatory and capital framework and that they address the root causes of what actually happened here, and what happened is a combination of macro impacts from the sharp, rapid rate increases and some idiosyncratic situations, namely a lack of proper asset and liability management at a small handful of banks.\n",
      "We don't see these issues as pervasive throughout the broader banking industry, but the events certainly highlight the importance of prudent asset and liability management. We still believe that there is plenty of capital amongst the large banks, and if capital requirements were to increase for the large banks by the regulators it would exacerbate any credit tightening that might go on.\n",
      "And related to that, what continues to keep me most awake at night is the quantity and quality of activity in the shadow banking industry. It does not benefit from the same regulatory frameworks and protections for participants, and I, amongst others, fear that more activity getting driven into it, if the banking capital requirements increase, will be to the detriment of system strength and stability. So we hope that this approach will be thoughtful and targeted to where the issues actually were.\n",
      "As I said in my opening comments, we thought that the regulators both at the local and national and the international level were swift and effective in making sure that they tackled the issues that were in front and we were absolutely delighted that the large banks acted as a source of strength.\n",
      "And let's just step back for a minute. In the face of tremendous market uncertainty, 11 of the largest US banks were able to come together to inject $30 billion of deposits into First Republic in a little over one day, and that speaks volumes for our capital and balance sheet positions, and I think the responsibility of large institutions in recognizing that we also play an important role here in helping stabilize situations like this. We thought it was very important to help buy some time and also demonstrate our confidence in the overall US banking system. So, I hope that gives you a bit of a flavor.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 4, Justification: The CEO largely avoids directly answering what specific regulatory changes she 'sees coming' in terms of more capital or liquidity. Instead, she expresses hopes for a 'thoughtful and targeted approach' and argues against increased capital requirements for large banks, essentially advocating for a desired outcome rather than making a prediction. While the question about the First Republic deposit was answered directly, the significant evasion on the forward-looking regulatory part of the question raises the overall evasiveness score.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Ken Usdin (Analyst): Okay, cool. And then one more just follow-up. End-of-period deposits down 3%, you mentioned the taxes. Are the taxes, is the tax impact felt across the business? When I look at the deposits page, there are a lot of ins and there are a lot of outs on an end-of-period basis, and just trying to get a sense of like what areas might have been impacted by that tax seasonality and where there was just some of the other pieces that you've already talked through in terms of inflows, outflows, and everything else in between.\n",
      "Mark Mason (CFO): Yeah, it's a good question. So, again, when you look at our deposits on an average basis, you see on page 26 that they tick up a little bit. If you look at it on an end of period basis, they're down about 3%, and essentially, intra-quarter, particularly in March as I mentioned earlier, we did see a sizable increase in flows. With that said, if you remember in the fourth quarter, we saw a nice run-up in deposits, and then we have the seasonality point that I referenced in my prepared remarks where we have both operational payments from our large Treasury and Trade Solutions clients as well as tax payments with our Treasury and Trade Solutions clients, also with Wealth clients to some extent kind of playing through the end-of-period deposits. And again, that for the most part is normal operating payments that we'd expect to see at this time of year.\n",
      "Jane Fraser (CEO): So no surprises in what happened.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 3, Justification: The CFO directly addresses which business areas were impacted by tax seasonality (Treasury and Trade Solutions and, to some extent, Wealth clients). However, the answer becomes somewhat generic regarding the 'lot of ins and outs' on the deposits page and other non-tax related movements, largely reiterating that these are 'normal operating payments' rather than providing a more detailed breakdown as the analyst seemed to be seeking.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Erika Najarian (Analyst): And just a follow-up on that. I guess, you guys have been you guys have been pretty clear on the timing, and pretty clear on why the curve will bend. I guess I'm wondering, is it just a timing issue that you're not giving us the sort of the dollar numbers that could go away from the transformation? Is it just a timing issue? Or are you still at a point where you don't know how much of that you would need to reinvest to arrive at that 5% revenue Compound Annual Growth Rate?\n",
      "Mark Mason (CFO): Sorry, your question was around expenses or the revenue?\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 4, Justification: The CFO's response is a clarifying question rather than an answer, effectively avoiding the core of the analyst's multi-faceted question about dollar numbers for transformation and reinvestment. By asking to choose between \"expenses or revenue,\" the CFO redirects the question and provides no relevant information.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Mike Mayo (Analyst): And if you define deposits this way, I mean, if I'm oversimplifying, correct me, but, look, you have 5,000 multinationals you really target for payments, Capital Markets and Banking. Those companies have a lot of deposits, a lot of Services. That's the stickiness and that's where you said 80% of your clients in Treasury and Trade Solutions have been with you for over 15 years.\n",
      "What if the deposits for those 5,000 multinationals, and I know I'm asking you to slice and dice in a little bit different way, but even just a general sense, because the reason I'm asking this is because I think there's a disconnect between showing percent of uninsured deposits as a measure of stickiness, and I don't think that's valid, and you've showed higher deposits even though you have a big percentage of uninsured deposits or maybe that doesn't matter as much as some front pages of newspapers are suggesting, so if you could address that.\n",
      "Mark Mason (CFO): Yeah, thanks, Mike. Look, I'd tell you to turn to page 26 in the earnings presentation. We've broken down the deposits for each of the businesses that we have, and at the bottom, you see the Treasury and Trade Solutions deposits, and this is where the 5,000 or so large multinational client deposits reside, and you can see the stability, as well as the steady growth in those deposits over time. And to your point, these are largely operational deposits that these clients have with us, and we shouldn't mistake rate sensitivity or betas with stickiness, right, and it's because these deposits tend to be quite sticky with us, as you can see here.\n",
      "Now, they're price-sensitive in the sense that as rates go up, we often have to reprice those. But remember, the relationships we have with these clients are broader than just deposit relationships, and that's what gives us the opportunity to adjust pricing accordingly with our deposits both in the US and outside of the US. And so the other page, in your own time you can look at it is the page prior to that which again speaks to the diversification of the portfolio but it also speaks to the length of time that many of these clients have been with us and have grown with us, and so nearly 80% of our deposits are from clients that have a greater than 15 year relationship with us, and that says a lot. And so anyway, those are the two points I'd make. Hopefully that addresses your question around the stickiness.\n",
      "Jane Fraser (CEO): Yeah, I often say it takes a root canal to extract us from the operations of our clients just because of exactly what we're talking about here, and that's also we see it even with the mid-market clients that are a growing portion here as well because we're helping them expand internationally, and that stickiness comes through and the Liquidity Coverage Ratio Market. of 120% is a very high-quality Liquidity Coverage Ratio Market. ratio.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 3, Justification: The management addresses the underlying concern about the stickiness of their deposits, explaining why they are sticky despite being largely uninsured (due to operational nature and long client relationships). However, they avoid directly validating or invalidating the analyst's premise about the 'percent of uninsured deposits' as a measure of stickiness, instead pivoting to their own evidence of stickiness. The response provides relevant information but only partially engages the specific framing of the question about the metric itself.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Erika Najarian (Analyst): So, I apologize having to ask the expense question again, but I think it's just very important because there's really two potential long-only investment thesis on Citi, right? One is the buyback given your tangible book values at $85 and the and the stock at $46 other is the spending the curve on expenses. So let me just ask Jim's question another way. In looking back to 2017, and I'm just looking at 2017 because I can break out legacy and core that way. And fast forward to 2022, you produced revenues ex Legacy Franchises about $61 billion in 2017 and about $67 billion in 2022. The associated expenses, again, without Legacy Franchises was about $34.5 billion in billion in 2017 versus $43.5 billion 2022, so you're surpassing the revenue uplift during that period by $3 billion.\n",
      "I guess the question is, you have so much certainty about the timing of this expense and I'm wondering how much of this $9 billion can go away? We understand that there's a lot of opportunity for reinvestment in the core business, but I think all of us are struggling to really understand that magnitude. And I think that the investor base in the market fully understands the Legacy Franchise story and how the exits will take time. But I think they're most interested in the core business and how much of that can come out.\n",
      "Mark Mason (CFO): Yes, sure. Look, no need to apologize for asking the question again, it's an important topic. I'd say a couple of things. So, one is that we can certainly look back in time, but I would highlight that we're here because we needed to have invested more in our franchise. And so undoubtedly, there's going to be an increase in our expense base that reflects the underinvestment from the past and in shoring up safety and soundness and actually moving towards a more automated operational, more modernized operations and infrastructure. So, there's certainly going to be that.\n",
      "With that said, with those investments come efficiencies. So, with the move from manual to automation over time, those types of investments will yield benefits in our cost structure. And that's part of what is going to bend the curve over that medium-term period.\n",
      "The other thing that I'd highlight is, obviously, with the Legacy Franchises, there's $7 billion of expense associated with those, and that will come down. But because of the Mexico transaction, we're going to be stuck with that a little bit longer given the IPO process. It doesn't put a big dent in our ability to bring stranded costs down and by the way, it does come with top line revenues and historically has been accretive to our profitability and returns.\n",
      "And so, I'm not going to give you kind of new guidance on where our expenses will end up. But what I will point you to is not only the $54 billion this year, roughly $54 billion this year, not only the bending of the curve in the third and fourth quarter or the third to the fourth quarter next year. But we've given guidance on top line growth, revenue of 5% call it Compound Annual Growth Rate through that medium-term period, and we've given you kind of operating efficiency targets that we've said as well, and we intend to deliver on those things that reflect the bending of that curve through all of those drivers that we've mentioned.\n",
      "So, I hope that helps, Erika. I appreciate the focus on both capital and expenses. We are equally focused on it and know just how important it is to achieving those targets. We're not only kind of doing the things that we've highlighted in that strategy articulation, but we're also being responsive to the current environment that we're in. We think that aids in our ability to deliver the targets and the bending of the curve, and we know there's an additional opportunity that Jane has referenced to the simplification of the organization as we make -- what I would argue is considerable progress on the exits towards the end of this year. And all of those things will be important to ensuring we get to that lower cost base, which we will do.\n",
      "Jane Fraser (CEO): And it's a laser micro focus from us to make sure that we have the plans in place and the execution to be able to achieve it. This is something we're extremely hands-on around and making sure that, it’s going to get done on each of the different drivers that Mark talked about.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 4, Justification: The analyst asked a very specific question about the magnitude of expense reduction, particularly in the core business and how much of the $9 billion increase could be reversed. The CFO explained the reasons for past increases and general strategies for future reductions but explicitly stated, \"I'm not going to give you kind of new guidance on where our expenses will end up.\" Instead of providing a specific number or range, the answer referred to previously stated general targets, thus avoiding the core quantitative aspect of the question.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Steven Chubak (Analyst): Hey, good morning. So I wanted to start off with a question just on the Investment Banking Return on Average Tangible Common Equity: Return on Average Tangible and trading outlook. On the trading side, just given some of the recent macro shocks, have you seen any evidence of bad volatility and are you still confident that you can sustain that mid-single-digit growth target? And just on the Investment Banking side, I wanted to see if there's any evidence of green shoots. It's been a challenging backdrop, as you noted, Mark, but I was hoping you could offer some color just across some of the different product lines, across Mergers & Acquisitions, Equity Capital Markets, Debt Capital Markets.\n",
      "Mark Mason (CFO): Why don't I start, and then, Jane, feel free to jump in. Look, we saw better performance in the quarter in Markets than when I talked at the conference earlier in the quarter. And really that played through in our Fixed Income business which was up about 4% year-over-year driven largely by strength in Rates and we saw rate volatility in the back end of the quarter and we were well-positioned to take advantage of that and serve clients and that aided getting us to down 4% in aggregate across Markets.\n",
      "What we talked about for the full year is kind of relatively flat performance, and I still think that based on what we see today and subject to how the macro continues to evolve that we'll be able to deliver on that. But as you know, volatility in many instances plays to the favor of Markets businesses, and so there's a bit of an unknown as to how that evolves. But I feel confident in the guidance that we've given thus far on that.\n",
      "Jane Fraser (CEO): Yeah, I'd jump in before you turn to Banking as well. I think one of the differences with our franchise compared to some others is that we are the go-to bank for corporates, and that provides a highly attractive but pretty steady flow of activity. This is obviously in the volatile markets we've been seeing is from our perspective very good volatility because we're able to support our clients in rates, Foreign Exchange, commodity hedging, and it makes our risk flows much more diversified than our competitors particularly in volatile markets like this. We're not taking positions. This is really attractive client flow business right at the heart of the global network.\n",
      "The other piece that I think is important in the mix here too is just the partnership with Treasury and Trade Solutions, cross-border payments, these other elements and cornerstone of the Foreign Exchange franchise, so there's some pieces here of the volatility that one doesn't usually think of this as being so client-heavy, but that's what's differentiating on the Citi franchise.\n",
      "Mark, back to you.\n",
      "Mark Mason (CFO): No, thank you, I think that's exactly right in terms of the corporate client base there. Look, in Investment Banking, obviously the wallets were down meaningfully last year. We saw some good performance in debt capital markets this quarter, up 66% versus the prior quarter, particularly as we saw activity in the investment grade names, which is an area of strength for us for sure, and I think there was a bit of momentum behind a bit more clarity on the direction of rates, and so we'll see how that continues to evolve and play out.\n",
      "The other thing I'd add is that we continue to have very good dialogue with clients as they manage through the environment and try to anticipate what the balance of the year looks like, and at some point, it's clear that clients are going to need to get back into the markets, but that trajectory is going to largely depend on the geopolitical and macro environment and how we all manage and navigate that uncertainty.\n",
      "So very engaged, healthy pipeline, but subject to how the environment continues to evolve.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 4, Justification: The response avoids directly addressing several specific aspects of the analyst's question. While it provided specific color on Debt Capital Markets, it completely omitted any discussion of Mergers & Acquisitions and Equity Capital Markets, which were explicitly requested. Additionally, the answer reframed the question about 'bad volatility' into 'good volatility' rather than directly confirming or denying 'bad' impacts, and provided a general outlook for trading instead of directly addressing confidence in the 'mid-single-digit growth target' mentioned by the analyst.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Ebrahim Poonawala (Analyst): Just one quick question, Mark, for you. On the consumer cards book, you gave some metrics. One, remind us of what you reserved for in terms of unemployment rate, macro, and if we do see a worsening in the markets, does that necessarily mean that we'll see big ratcheting up of credit reserves from where you already are? Just some color around that would be helpful.\n",
      "Mark Mason (CFO): Sorry, just the last part of your question, I'm sorry, if we do see what?\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 5, Justification: The CFO's response is solely a request for clarification, indicating they did not fully hear or understand the last part of the question. This completely defers answering the analyst's query about credit reserves and unemployment rate assumptions, providing no relevant information in response.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Matt O'Connor (Analyst): You have mentioned continued normalization of credit card in the back half of the year. And just wondering, you've got the normalized loss rates on Slide 22. Are you still thinking you'll hit those, I think, exiting this year or early next year. And then I think at one point, you said they might go a little bit above that before they kind of come back to a normal level? And is that still the case?\n",
      "Mark Mason (CFO): Thanks for the question. The answer is yes. We still expect for both portfolios to hit those normal levels sometime at the end of the year, the normal level, as you pointed out, on the page for both Branded as well as for Retail Services. We would expect, again, subject to how and when this mild recession kind of plays out, we would expect that they would tick higher than that before getting back inside of that range.\n",
      "But again, all of this is tied into how we've calculated our reserves, the delinquencies that we're seeing, the mix of the portfolio, which again skews towards your higher Fair Isaacson Company scores and the customer behaviors that we're seeing, which play through not only that cost of credit line, but also plays through the growth that we referenced earlier in the top line. But short answer is yes, that's still our thinking.\n",
      "Jane Fraser (CEO): And as Mark said, I think we feel good about our positioning as a prime, but also a strong credit proposition that we have. We're seeing stronger demand for the credit-led products such as value cards, bulk on installment loans as well the service-led engagement for the more prime customers. And so that's also going to be a valuable factor driving growth and profitability as well.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 1, Justification: The CFO directly answers both parts of the analyst's question regarding credit card loss rates, confirming the expected timing and the possibility of rates ticking higher before normalizing. The additional context provided by both executives supports their statements without deflecting from the original question.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Gerard Cassidy (Analyst): Mark, can you share with us, in your financial supplement, obviously, you give us good details on your credit picture and we're talking about credit right now. The nonaccrual loans have been flat as a pancake for the last 12 months for you folks and the industry as well. And this is in light of the Fed funds rates, as we all know, have been up over 500 basis points. Can you guys share with us why we haven't seen more, this is mostly corporate of course, but everybody has been hanging in there very well in view of the fact that rates have gone up so much. What are your customers telling you or are you seeing that has enabled them to remain very healthy in light of a 500-basis point increase in interest rates?\n",
      "Mark Mason (CFO): I think I'd point to a couple of things, Gerard. One is, remember, we focus on the large multinational, largely investment-grade quality names. And so that's one important factor when you think about our ICG and corporate exposure there. The second thing I'd point out is we have to remember that many of these companies had and still have very strong balance sheets and that they've managed that through the COVID and pandemic situation and that has positioned them well.\n",
      "I think the third thing is that and you've heard us mention how we're proactively managing the prospect of a recession. And I think when I talk to other CFOs, I know that when Jane talks to other CEOs, they too are looking at their expense line. They too are looking at the efficiency of their organizations and opportunity to increase that efficiency in light of a potential slowdown or recessionary environment. And then the final point is, I think a lot of firms have been that were proactive in the low-rate environment, in shoring up that balance sheet strength.\n",
      "Now with that said, you'veheard us also mention the prospect of a rebound in capital market activities, and that has to happen at some point. But sticking to your point around credit, I really think it's those factors that you see play through in not only our very low Non-Accrual Loan, but also our very low credit losses, credit cost that you've seen in our business.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 1, Justification: The CFO's answer is very direct, providing multiple specific reasons why nonaccrual loans have remained flat despite rising interest rates. He attributes this to the investment-grade nature of their clients, their strong balance sheets, proactive expense management, and prior efforts to shore up finances. These points directly address the analyst's inquiry about customer health.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Erika Najarian (Analyst): Expenses. So, we get loud and clear why the curve will bend. We get loud and clear when the curve will bend, right? And there's clearly just expenses there that are catch-up expenses that are transformational expenses to everything that Jane talked about. And that message has been loud and clear. And I'm wondering if you haven't told us what could come out of those expenses because it's just a timing issue, it's July 14th versus 4Q'24? Or have you not yet made decisions in terms of how you may allocate those expenses in terms of do you need some of those expenses that could come out to grow your revenue base to that 5% Compound Annual Growth Rate versus having it fall to the bottom line? Sorry, that's the question.\n",
      "Mark Mason (CFO): Yes. So, I'd say a couple of things. So, one, Erika, is obviously, with that revenue Compound Annual Growth Rate will be volume-related expenses that play out. But we're also focused, obviously, on the non-volume-related expenses and not giving you a precise number because the magnitude of that bend, right, is a factor, right?\n",
      "So obviously, Mexico, for example, as I mentioned earlier, impacts the magnitude of the bend, right? And we're going to, and have, in fact, when you look at our expense base even for the quarter, we've spent money in Mexico to drive that top line 22% revenue growth, 10% ex-Foreign Exchange.\n",
      "And so, there are going to be nuances in the running of the business in a way that ensures we're maximizing shareholder value that impacts the magnitude of the bending of that that expense curve. Investments that I’ve got to continue to make in in Treasury and Trade Solutions order to maintain that #1 position and that that competitive advantage we have. And so those things will impact that magnitude of the bend. We've been, I think, very transparent as we get into each year, giving you concrete numbers. What I'm telling you is the curve will bend. And as we get closer to 2024, we'll give you more direction on the magnitude for that year and beyond.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 3, Justification: The CFO acknowledges not providing a precise number and suggests a timing issue by stating more direction will be given closer to 2024. However, the response does not directly address the analyst's nuanced question about whether the lack of specificity is due to decisions not yet being made regarding the allocation of potential expense reductions (to growth vs. bottom line). The answer is somewhat vague about the 'why' behind the non-disclosure.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Steven Chubak (Analyst): Thanks for that perspective, Jane, very well said. Just one quick follow-up for me. PBWM fee income trends, given the lower partner payments, I mean clearly the Wealth fee trends would suggest that they were quite subdued in the quarter. And I just wanted to understand your outlook over the near medium term what drove some of the weakness this quarter? Is it something that you expect will likely persist, especially given some of the market tailwinds that we've been seeing, would have expected to see a little bit more resiliency in Wealth fee income in particular.\n",
      "Mark Mason (CFO): Yes. Look, I think as we mentioned, Wealth was down about 5%. It's really hard to talk the rebound in Wealth in the midst of such an uncertain environment and the one that we're in, it's hard to disconnect those macro factors like rates, inflation, the prospect of a recession from what we're seeing in Wealth. And I think there are two dynamics that have played out. One has been the shift from our customers, from customers more broadly into higher-yielding products from out of deposits. And the other has been the fee revenue from an investment management fee point of view, and as you might think about it, it is a higher rate environment. There are opportunities for clients to earn more. And not until there's greater certainty in the broader macro factors will I think we start to see some real momentum tick up there.\n",
      "Now with that said, and a couple of things worth reiterating, which is we're seeing very strong referral momentum from the Retail Banking business up through wealth continuum, if you will. So, we've had about 25,000 referrals May year-to-date from our retail branches into our broader Wealth business, that's a good thing. We've seen the number of clients that we've onboarded tick up pretty meaningfully, both in the Private Bank and more broadly across Wealth. That's a good thing. Those are things that that position us well for when greater certainty does play out and these clients start to put monies back to work in the broader investment platform and offering that we have.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 2, Justification: The CFO directly addressed the drivers of weakness in Wealth fee income (macro factors, client shift to higher-yielding products) and explained the conditions under which these trends might persist or improve. While a precise numerical outlook for the near-medium term was not provided, this was attributed to market uncertainty, and the response included a detailed explanation of underlying dynamics and positive internal momentum, making it mostly direct.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Ebrahim Poonawala (Analyst): That's helpful. And just one very simplistic question. When you talk to some of your largest shareholders, those who are optimistic think you can hit your Return on Average Tangible Common Equity target medium term by 2025. Is that a realistic expectation given I appreciate Basel changes, you answered like 10 questions on expenses. But should we expect the groundwork through '24 that we hit that medium-term target in ‘ w25 or just your degree of confidence.\n",
      "Mark Mason (CFO): Yes. Again, the thing I'd point out and Jane, feel free to chime in here, is that what we talked about was getting to our medium-term returns, 11% to 12% and the medium term is ‘ 25 to ‘ 26, right? So it's not just ‘ 25, just to be clear. And we do continue to feel very confident around our ability to do that. You heard us mention the levers that we think will contribute to that. Obviously, capital is important and how that evolves, and we continue to kind of work to optimize the balance sheet while serving our clients effectively and importantly, growing the strong businesses that we have that are high returning as well.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 2, Justification: The CFO directly addresses the analyst's question about the degree of confidence and clarifies the target timeframe for hitting the ROTCE target. While not explicitly stating 'yes, it is realistic,' the strong expression of confidence and mention of contributing levers largely answers the implicit question about realism, with only minor vagueness regarding the detailed execution path.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Mike Mayo (Analyst): And one more attempt, can you remind us how many people are working on the transformation remediation and how much that's costing you?\n",
      "Mark Mason (CFO): Yes, again we’ve got, I think the number I shared was somewhere around 13,000 people or so that are broadly working on the efforts here. We haven't gotten into specific costs; you know it's in the total number. But what I would say again is that we're clear on what we've got to deliver and execute against and we're managing that cost very tightly. We're constantly looking at opportunities to deliver on those transformation deliverables, more efficiently, leveraging technology, leveraging Artificial Intelligence in some instances. And so we're not just taking those execution plans as they were crafted and delivering against them. But we're looking for efficiencies and even the execution plans as they're constructed today. And that's important for us to keep doing.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 4, Justification: The CFO explicitly stated they \"haven't gotten into specific costs\" for the transformation, directly avoiding the second part of the analyst's question about cost. Instead of providing the requested cost, the CFO shifted to general statements about managing costs tightly and seeking efficiencies, which is a clear redirection and evasion.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Ebrahim Poonawala (Analyst): Yes. So, one, like where are you in terms of your unemployment rate assumption? And if the unemployment outlook worsens, let's say, over the next 6 to 12 months, does that mean that you are already reserved? Or will we see another big pickup in provisioning as a result of that?\n",
      "Mark Mason (CFO): Got it. Thank you. Look, our current reserves, as you know, as we think about Current Expected Credit Losses, we've got 3 different scenarios, we've got a base case in upside, a downside. Our current reserves are based on the mix of those 3 macroeconomic scenarios. It reflects about a 5.1% unemployment rate on a weighted basis over the 8 quarters, and it's roughly flat to what it was last quarter. What that means is, obviously, our downside scenario has unemployment that's much higher than that, closer to 7% or call it 6.8% or so. But that's kind of how we've thought about unemployment.\n",
      "As we think about the reserves each quarter, obviously, we take a look at the macroeconomic factors and how they're evolving. Our base case today assumes a mild recession and reserves in the future will consider how are weighting towards downside, upside and baseline may morph subject to our outlook and volumes. Those are the 2 factors that influence whether we're increasing reserves or not.\n",
      "I would point out though that in addition to unemployment and because has been as stubborn as it has been, if you will, we also look at debt service coverage ratio as an important factor as we think about our consumers, as we think about their balance sheet, as we think about the risk that they may or may not be facing. So unemployment is an important factor, but we've flexed our thinking in light of the environment and in light of how behaviors have been shifting, and that's an important factor in how we think about our reserves as well. I feel very good about the level of our reserves. You heard us mention earlier, we've got $20 billion of reserves, we're well reserved across the portfolio, but those are all important elements to it.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 2, Justification: The CFO directly answers the question about the current unemployment rate assumption (5.1% weighted). Regarding the potential for future provisioning if unemployment worsens, the CFO explains the process of re-weighting macroeconomic scenarios and considering other factors, and expresses confidence in current reserve levels. While not giving a definitive \"yes\" or \"no\" to whether more provisioning will be needed, the answer provides a clear framework and current assessment rather than fully avoiding the question.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Charles Peabody (Analyst): Okay. And just as a follow-up, is there any sort of directional guidance you can give on Markets related to Net Interest Income? I mean does it mean to the extent second quarter was bolstered by dividend, it comes down in the third quarter, but then does it go back up in the fourth quarter? So would the second half be kind of equivalent to the first half?\n",
      "Mark Mason (CFO): Charles, I really appreciate the attempt there. But I'm not going to give any further guidance on the breakout of the Net Interest Income, I will reiterate the ex-Markets Net Interest Income increase, by the way, to plus $46 billion but thanks for question. I appreciate that.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 4, Justification: The CFO explicitly stated they would not provide the requested directional guidance on Markets-related Net Interest Income. Instead of addressing the second-half outlook, they reiterated a different, unrelated Net Interest Income figure, directly avoiding the core of the analyst's question.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Mike Mayo (Analyst): I meant to follow up earlier on the bending of the cost curve, but if you were to put different initiatives in terms of how far along you are maybe like your exits might be in the eighth inning, and your transformation might be in the sixth inning, and your remediation in the fifth inning, the simplification in the first inning or second inning. Are those numbers correct? How would you put those numbers? And in terms of bending the cost curve, where are you further along and where are you just getting started?\n",
      "Mark Mason (CFO): Well, Mike, you know I love you, but I'm not going to play that game. What I will say is that we clearly have work that we're doing as it relates to the exits, but making very good progress on that, not just on the closing of the exits but also on putting a dent in the stranded costs associated with those exits that we have closed.\n",
      "And so, as Jane mentioned in her prepared remarks, by the time we get to end of the year, ex-Mexico, we would have made a considerable amount of progress on there, and that creates an opportunity to do more around the simplification of the organization and so that simplification is obviously in an earlier inning, call it, the exits in a later inning.\n",
      "I think that the transformation spend investments and those things, look we are squarely into execution, as you've heard us mention before. And as I've mentioned, the expense base around that is going to continue to morph from spend that we've made around third-party consultants and that helped in the crafting of the plan towards technology, towards people that are critically involved in the execution of it and then a downward trajectory towards the benefits we get from that technology and reduced operational expense. And so, it's a multi-year journey, we've talked about that. We've got a number of years to continue to execute against it. But what's important is we know what we have to do, both in how we're investing that money and as it relates to being disciplined about our cost structure and bending the curve. And again, that's what we're going to do.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 4, Justification: The CFO explicitly refused to provide the specific 'inning' numbers requested by the analyst, stating, 'I'm not going to play that game.' While some qualitative progress was mentioned for exits and simplification (later vs. earlier inning), the answer largely avoided the specific, phased breakdown of progress for all initiatives and the broader 'bending the cost curve' progress that the analyst sought.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Matt O'Connor (Analyst): And then the follow-up, and this is not really Citi-specific, but for the card industry, a lot of the banks that are in card. Everyone is talking about kind of getting to normalized levels, just call it in the near term here next couple of quarters. And I guess, just thoughts on getting this normalized level of losses when unemployment is all-time low, wages are growing. Obviously, there's inflationary pressures, but it's just a little surprising, again, not to Citi-specific, but it's a little surprising that we're getting to this normalized state when things seem like they're pretty good.\n",
      "Jane Fraser (CEO): Yes, I think well, also normalized state back in 2019 was also pretty good. So, you're not hearing any alarm bells ringing from Mark or myself at all here on the U.S. consumer, I think we see the U.S. consumer as resilient, we've talked about them being cautious but they're not recessionary. And we are seeing more pressure on the lower FICOs. We don't have a large number of that in our portfolio, but that is where we're seeing more of the normalization happening on the payment rates, for example, and other behaviors in there. So, it's quite localized, but I don't think we should be overly concerned here about the health of the U.S. consumer.\n",
      "And as Mark said, we're in a very unusual environment. Higher inflation, these rate levels and a strong labor market. And under those conditions, it's the debt service ratio, as he said, that is, we think, is a more useful leading indicator that we keep a close eye on.\n",
      "Mark Mason (CFO): Just remember, it's a return to normal.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 2, Justification: The answer mostly addresses the question by explaining where the normalization is occurring within their portfolio (lower FICOs) and reframing 'normalized levels' as a return to 2019 conditions, which were also good. While it doesn't fully delve into the broader macroeconomic reasons for industry-wide normalization despite low unemployment, it provides specific points and reassurance, avoiding clear evasion.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Steven Chubak (Analyst): Wanted to ask a question on capital. Just given the recent increase in your SCB, I was hoping to better understand why the 11.5% to 12% remains the appropriate long-term objective in your mind? And as we prepare for Basel III endgame, think through the capital benefit from future asset sales, can you speak to whether that will translate into operational risk capital relief specifically as it's less clear whether those benefits will accrete even as those asset sales are consummated?\n",
      "Jane Fraser (CEO): I'll kick it off, Mark, and then pass it to you. So we're confident we're going to meet 11% to 12% Return on Average Tangible Common Equity target over the medium term. The core drivers of how we get there remains unchanged.\n",
      "One, it's the revenues that we expect to grow by 4% to 5% Compound Annual Growth Rate as we continue to execute on the strategy. On expenses, it's the clear path to bend the curve by the end 2024, bringing those expenses down over the medium term. And third and importantly, it's continuing to optimize our balance sheet, including improving Risk-Weighted Assets and capital efficiency. And as we referenced earlier in the prepared remarks, different drivers in that, that are helpful, exiting 14 international consumer markets, changing our business mix. And I'd also note that the transformation has benefits not only for our efficiency, but it will also support Risk-Weighted Assets and capital optimization.\n",
      "That said, there's uncertainty around the future capital requirements in the industry and importantly, the timing of their implementation. We like everyone again to have to work through those implications once we know what they are. But as we said, keep in mind, we've got some other levers to pull over time, capital allocation, Deferred Tax Assets allocation and utilization, our Global Systemically Important Banks score and our management buffer of 100 basis points. So that's where you hear the confidence from us around the path to executing and that remaining consistent. But Mark, why don't I hand over to you just around consumer market sales and operational Risk-Weighted Assets relief.\n",
      "Mark Mason (CFO): Sure. And again, I think that if you look at the transactions that we've closed to date, they've generated or freed up about $4.6 billion of capital the two that remain to be closed and the balance of year will generate another $1.2 billion or so. That will be important to our capital base. I think that we obviously have to see the proposal as it comes out and the NPR. And we'll have a window to respond to that. We're hopeful that the regulators hear our response and views on it as it comes out.\n",
      "There's clearly going to be reference to increases in Risk-Weighted Assets and operational risk implications potentially as part of that. I do think that exiting, without having seen the proposal, and without obviously knowing how those rules might evolve. I do believe that the exiting of these 14 markets does play towards not only reducing our SCB in stress scenarios or as it comes out of stress analysis and tests, but also should play through helping to reduce risk-weighted assets and potentially operational risk as well. But we have to see what the proposal looks like and go through that.\n",
      "And I think what's important here is that whenever it comes out, whatever it looks like, as we dissect it and go through it, we'll figure out how to manage through it, right, whether that be through exiting certain products, seeking price adjustments as it relates to customers, clients and the markets or continuing to optimize RWAs and we have been doing very proactively, we'll figure out how to manage.\n",
      "Jane Fraser (CEO): And I feel compelled to jump in here as well because as the spring and the recent test results showed the large U.S. banks are not only in a strong capital position, but we've been able to play an important stabilizing role for the system as a whole. It's a role that we take very seriously. And we certainly hope that as the details of the capital frameworks get unveiled, this is fully taken into consideration, including the impact on U.S. competitiveness, and we need a level playing field with Europe, not a gold-plated one, and we share the concern that higher capital levels will undoubtedly increase the cost of capital for medium- and smaller-sized enterprises and consumers in particular and will drive more activity to non-regulated and lesser capitalized players that isn't in the system's interest. And we hope that that's fully taken into consideration here because we will take actions on businesses, and we will take pricing actions as will the entire industry.\n",
      "Mark Mason (CFO): Really important point.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 4, Justification: The management's response largely avoids directly addressing the specific nuances of the analyst's questions. For the capital objective, they discuss general capital management and levers rather than explaining why the 11.5-12% remains appropriate despite the recent SCB increase. Regarding operational risk capital relief from asset sales, the answer is heavily qualified and defers clarity to future regulatory proposals, avoiding a direct expectation. The extended discussion on industry-wide capital implications further redirects from the specific queries.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Charles Peabody (Analyst): A question about your Markets related net interest income. And before I ask the question, I do appreciate that you run those businesses on a holistic basis and that Net Interest Income is probably more of a residual outcome. But a couple of questions related to Markets-related Net Interest Income. First is, you had a pretty nice jump up in the second quarter versus the first quarter. And I just wanted to understand, is that largely related to seasonal dividend issues?\n",
      "And then secondly, you have a positive Net Interest Income outcome, where a lot of your money center in brethren will have a negative Net Interest Income outcome for Markets and I was just wondering what the difference is? Is it the outsized FICC business relative to Equities? Or is it the international? Or is it how you hedge? What's the difference on that? So those are the 2 questions.\n",
      "Mark Mason (CFO): Thanks for the question, and thanks for the acknowledgment that we do manage our Markets revenues in total, so I appreciate that. What I would say in terms of the Markets Net Interest Income is, you've captured it right, which is the dynamic that's playing out between first quarter and second quarter is, in fact, dividend season. And again, given the globality of our franchise, the dividend is not just a dividend in any one region, but dividend in multiple regions playing out over the course of the first and second quarter.\n",
      "I can't speak to the peers at this particular stage. But what I would say is that you know that our book skews more so than peers to corporates, and that's important. And we obviously have a very, very strong FICC business more broadly as well. So dividend season, major driver here in that increase.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 2, Justification: The CFO directly and clearly answered the first question regarding the Q-o-Q jump in Markets NII being due to dividend season. For the second question about why their Markets NII is positive compared to peers, he provided relevant contributing factors like their corporate client skew and strong FICC business, which partially addressed the analyst's hypotheses. However, he started with a slight deflection (\"I can't speak to the peers\") and did not explicitly address all the analyst's suggested differences (e.g., hedging strategy), leading to minor vagueness.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Vivek Juneja (Analyst): But I'm presuming you want to go sooner rather than later because the market is going to expect that rather than take a full 3 years or whatever the Fed might give you.\n",
      "Mark Mason (CFO): You know what, I'm really interested at this point in seeing the proposal, and then we'll have a chance to kind of, to really react as an industry and as a firm.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 4, Justification: The CFO completely avoids addressing the analyst's question about the firm's preference to act \"sooner rather than later\" due to market expectations. Instead, the response redirects by stating the need to first see a proposal, thereby deferring any comment on the timeline or urgency.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Mike Mayo (Analyst): Hi. Jane, you spoke more about the restructuring that you commented on recently. The real question is, why is this restructuring different than the other 5 or 10 or 15 restructurings we've heard about since Citi's creation in its current form 25 years ago, I think, just like a week ago? So, I'd say, why is this different? We hear the talk about cascading downward and the simplification, reducing dual heads and the committees. But we've heard this so much that why is this time different?\n",
      "Jane Fraser (CEO): Yeah. It's a very important question, Mike, thank you for asking it. As I've said, we view these as the most consequential changes we've made, not just to our organization model, but how we run the bank, in almost two decades. And the first piece is simple, which is our org model was set up for a financial supermarket, that is simply not the bank we are today. So we are aligning the organizational model with that simper business mix and strategy.\n",
      "But what's truly different is we're changing how we run the bank. And these are permanent changes that will be driven all the way down through the organization. So let me give you some examples to bring it to life. We talked about delayering the first two or three layers of the bank. That will continue through the organization, through the spans and layers, particularly getting rid of aggregator roles. And let me give an example: HR, we had HR in a region, you had the region head, you had the Institutional Client Group head, you had the Banking head, in addition, you had a North Asia head and a South Asia head. We're just going to have the North Asia head and the South Asia head. And all of those roles collapsed into those two.\n",
      "We're eliminating activities in the geographies that we just don't need anymore, because we are no longer running local consumer franchises in them. So, let's take the financial reporting, sorry, the management reporting that Mark and I referred to in the opening remarks. We can reduce our management reports by about 50%. That's 1,000 reports. What does that mean? Shadow P&Ls by country, quarterly outlooks, monthly performance updates, all the associated tracking and reconciliations that are there that are effectively for a shadow P&L, rather than the one that matters to our shareholders. And so, that greatly declutters.\n",
      "It also means we can eliminate processes for our Transformation, where we are looking at how do we automate those processes, automate those controls. If they're a duplicative process, we're getting rid of them so we don't need to do that anymore and it will accelerate the work on Transformation.\n",
      "We are taking activities out of some of the businesses and centralizing them. A lot of the client activities that will go embedded into a business, we move that up to centralized utilities that the whole firm can benefit from and that will get scale economies. These strategy teams, marketing teams, many of the little cottage industries that build up over time.\n",
      "We can speed up decision-making with fewer committee layers. We'll take down the number of layers and drive that from some places 13, we're looking to getting to 8 in as many places as we possibly can. We're giving clarity of decision rights and changing decision rights from two or more people to just one.\n",
      "So much more single points of accountability, again more aligned with our shareholder interests, because those points of accountability are more sitting in the products.\n",
      "And the types of metrics we are looking at to help us measure this spans layers, revenue producers and non- producers, grade mixes, synergies that we're realizing, voice of the client, but I say that our expectations and our execution of the business strategy is also at the heart of what we're trying to drive here.\n",
      "Our strength is our global network. I don't want our geographies focused on the full monty of management processes that are a duplication of what's happening in the product organization. I want them focused on delivering to our clients, engaging with our clients and also managing their responsibilities of the legal entities.\n",
      "The same way for our Banking organization. Putting the Investment Bank, the Corporate Bank and Commercial Bank together will really make it easier for us to realize the synergies across them. So, the cross-sell or the movement of a commercial mid-market company up to a corporate lending company and a corporate banking company, much easier when they're all in the same organization. Or selling our Banking products suite into that Commercial Bank customer and other examples.\n",
      "So, it's really changing decision-making, freeing up people to focus on clients and Transformation, much greater transparency, changing decision-making and rights, driving synergies. We put a huge amount of work all the way through the summer in design as to how do we want the organization to work. That is now getting driven down into the designing in detail and in depth all of these types of activities through the second and third layers at the moment into the fourth and then until we finish at the end of the first quarter.\n",
      "So, it's very different. You'll get more flavor of it in the fourth quarter earnings call, but I hope that gives you a sense of why this is really different. This is how we are running the place. It's not just an org restructuring. Both are necessary.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 1, Justification: The CEO directly addresses the analyst's skepticism by clearly articulating the strategic shift away from a 'financial supermarket' model and providing numerous concrete examples of how this restructuring is different, such as delayering, eliminating redundant reports, centralizing activities, and speeding up decision-making. The answer is specific and offers tangible evidence for the difference compared to past restructurings.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Gerard Cassidy (Analyst): And then as a follow-up, when you think about what we've seen with the Fed's tightening over the last 12 months, banks like your own have positioned the balance sheet accordingly and I know the Bank Analysts Association of Boston, Michael [Verdeschi] did a good job explaining how you guys manage the balance sheet. And when you look at it going forward, do you think changes are coming because the Fed if they end in Fed funds rate increase as we get to a terminal rate, how are you guys positioned the balance sheet, do you think going forward?\n",
      "Mark Mason (CFO): Look, we're constantly actively managing the balance sheet in light of not only our client needs, but also how we see the broader macro environment evolving and changing. And as you know, and I know you've seen and we've talked about before, we share in our Qs, our view on our estimate for interest rate exposure and what happens with 100 basis points swing in rates in one direction or another across the curve across currencies. You've seen that shift over the last number of quarters to last quarter where that estimate for IRE was about $1.7 billion or so, but heavily skewed towards non-U.S. dollar rates and currencies.\n",
      "And I think as we think about the view on how rates will evolve, you'll see a continued shift there. I think that that when we look to print this quarter, number will probably come down a bit in terms of interest rate exposure and skew even more towards non-U.S. dollar currencies in light of where rates are in those markets and the U.S. dollar will likely be somewhat neutral in light of that curve currently looks like. But again, something we actively manage, first with an eye towards what client demand and needs are likely to be for use of our liquidity but also with a view for how the macro environment might evolve and what we're hearing from central banks around the world.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 4, Justification: The answer largely relies on general statements about constantly managing the balance sheet and refers to high-level forecasts of interest rate exposure (IRE) shifts. It does not directly address how the balance sheet will be specifically 'positioned' or what strategic changes will be made in response to the Fed reaching a terminal rate, focusing more on the outcomes of ongoing management rather than the proactive strategy itself.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Jim Mitchell (Analyst): Hey good morning. Mark, maybe on the revenue discussion there, let's talk about Net Interest Income a little bit. You guys have a very unique deposit base, a lot smaller footprint in low-cost consumer. Betas have been, already been high, so it doesn't seem like there's as much beta catch-up risk for you. It's 50% non-US roughly. How do you think about the trajectory of Net Interest Income, do you think it stabilizes next year before rate cuts? How do we think about the puts and takes on your Net Interest Income into next year?\n",
      "Mark Mason (CFO): Yeah, thanks for the question. Look. I'm not going to give guidance for 2024, we'll do that obviously at the fourth quarter 2023 earnings. But I think it's reasonable to expect that some of the trends that we've seen so far will continue. So, if you think about what's underneath this, we'll continue to benefit from higher rates across currencies. I think we'll continue to see benefits from card interest-earning balance growth.\n",
      "Recall that when you look at our US dollar IRE position, it's relatively neutral at this point. And interest-earning balance growth is expected to be driven by continued card spend and lower payment rates. And so, I think what's important to remember, as it relates to our business, is that it's global. That we've got, while you're right in that, on the U.S. dollar side, we've seen betas kind of reach, particularly for our corporate clients, reach terminal levels at the end of last year. On the non-US dollar side, betas run lower. They lag. And there's still upside there because it's a different rate curve and a different pace of increases.\n",
      "And so, those will be some of the puts and takes to think about. Volumes, the rates, the speed of the curve moves, and then how betas evolve, that will kind of factor in.\n",
      "And then the final thing to remember is that, in our Net Interest Income, we show it both with and without Markets, on the ex- Markets, we'll have the impact of the drag from the exits of the countries that kind of play out. So, we just exited Taiwan. That's going to impact obviously the next quarter's Net Interest Income. So, just a couple of factors to think about and obviously I'll give you more detail on 2024 at the fourth quarter earnings call.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 4, Justification: The CFO explicitly stated they would not give 2024 guidance, directly avoiding the analyst's question about the trajectory and stabilization of Net Interest Income for the upcoming year. While he listed several general factors influencing NII, he refrained from providing a specific outlook or answering whether it would stabilize, effectively deferring the answer to a future earnings call.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Ken Usdin (Analyst): I know this is going long here. Just a quick one, just, Mark, just wanted to get your sense on the sentiment around client activity in both the Markets group and what the pipelines are looking like in Investment Banking and the feel for that? Thanks.\n",
      "Jane Fraser (CEO): Look, I'll jump in here. Corporates are pretty cautious. They've got another Fed hike in the offing, tensions in China and the West, OPEC and all, and a general sense of more limited growth. But I think clients have been trying to understand and get their arms around both the macro and the market outlook for a while. I think they now seem to accept the current environment is new normal and are beginning to position themselves globally.\n",
      "So globally, we're seeing less anxiety around funding as most large corps are biting the bullet and paying higher rates to take advantage of issuance windows, balance sheet is getting reinforced, we certainly don't see a large cap credit prices on the horizon. And on the Investment Banking Return on Average Tangible Common Equity: Return on Average Tangible side, it remains, the pipeline is robust. There's a lot of pent-up demand for Mergers & Acquisitions but it's hard to predict when that pipeline will unlock. Equity Capital Markets had tangible momentum over Q1, and we're also seeing sponsor lev fin showing signs of improvement, but both of those are from a very, very low base.\n",
      "And on the investor side, most of the investors stayed on the sidelines in Q2. The debt ceiling was a bigger topic than economic news was, and then it was a very low vol environment. We saw a bit of a pickup at the beginning with the light bump in volatility in the last few days, but I wouldn't call that a trend yet.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 1, Justification: The answer is very direct and comprehensive. It directly addresses the sentiment around client activity in Markets by explaining investors largely stayed on the sidelines in Q2, and it clearly details Investment Banking pipelines, noting a robust M&A pipeline while acknowledging the difficulty in predicting when it will unlock, along with specific comments on ECM and sponsor lev fin.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Mike Mayo (Analyst): One negative question, one positive question. So, on the negative side, you talked about bending the cost curve, but I think second quarter year-over-year, it's bending the wrong way, and 6 quarters from now, you're saying it should bend the other way. So, what are we not seeing in the financials that gives you such confidence? Because it seems, based on this quarter's results, a little bit more of a trust me story. And on the positive side, Treasury and Trade Solutions, continued double-digit growth, you continue to invest more in that business, how are you monetizing greater money in motion among your multinational and other clients?\n",
      "Jane Fraser (CEO): Thanks Mike, I'll kick it off and then send it back to Mark. In terms of the expense side, I think we've been very transparent about the arc of our investment spend related both to the transformation and beyond.\n",
      "We'll continue to give you that transparency, Mike. Note last year, we hit our expense guidance. This year, we're on track for the guidance of roughly the $54 billion, ex-Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and divestitures and looking forward, we continue to guide what are the 3 levers that will drive the reduction in the expense curve starting at the end of '24.\n",
      "It's from exits and I think you've got a clear sense around the progress that we have been making on the divestitures. And therefore, we're pivoting, as we talked about, to focus now on really tackling the stranded expenses as we close off the final couple of sales there in Asia in the next few months.\n",
      "We'll realize the benefits from our investments in transformation and controls over the medium term. We'll also have the benefit of the remediation work getting done and expenses going away from that. And then the third one will be simplifying the organization, as we talked about. So, we'll continue to walk you, step by step, what are the different actions we're taking, what are we doing, and hopefully we are building up that track record of doing what we will say we are going to do every quarter.\n",
      "Mark Mason (CFO): The only thing I’d add on the expense side, and then you may want to touch on the Treasury and Trade Solutions, but the only add on the expense side is, we are taking repositioning charges, Mike. I mean we're not sitting still as we go through this uncertain period of time where wallets across certain parts of the industry are under significant pressure. And in taking those repositioning charges, there are going to be expense reductions that ultimately play out over the next 12-month period. So that's the other factor in addition to what Jane mentioned in the way of exits and benefits from the transformation that will play into the cost base over the next 12 months.\n",
      "Jane Fraser (CEO): And then on Treasury and Trade Solutions, I think we all share your enthusiasm for this business in terms of the growth potential that we've been realizing and expect to continue, albeit converging now to the medium-term guidance over the next few quarters where we see it's a high to medium single-digit growth going forward. It's a very high-returning business and some of the indicators of how we're monetizing those relationships. We're seeing it both in terms of new client wins, they were up 41% this quarter. We have a sustained win-loss ratio of 80% on the new deals across different client segments. We're also seeing growth that's starting to really kick in from our commercial bank and the expansion of clients in the middle market around the world as we grow out that franchise.\n",
      "And we've got some very good fee-growth, which as Mark points out, and I point out all the time, we're very focused around, so cross-border up 11% U.S. dollar clearing up 6%, commercial cards up 15%, etc.. And we continue to invest in the business as well, so to make sure that 80%-win ratio continues. So, first bank to launch 24/7, 365 dollar clearing, U.S. dollar clearing. We've got the instant payments platform we just launched for e-commerce clients. We have Payments Express that is now live in the U.S., on track for 5 markets by the year-end. So, it's a story of innovation, it’s a story of investment, it's got great returns. It's a good growth story, and it just, it keeps on going.\n",
      "And I don't want to diminish Securities Services in there either. It's another business that's, similarly, continuing to see significant client wins, up 65% versus last year as well. And a lot of our strategy there has been focused on gaining share with the asset managers in North America. Couple of years ago, we're down at 2.6% share. We're up about 4.3%. Our target is about 5.5% there in 2025 in that key growth area. I know there's a lot to like here too.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 3, Justification: The response for the cost curve question, while outlining future strategic levers and reiterating guidance, does not directly address the analyst's concern about 'what we are not seeing in the financials' that gives management confidence despite the current year-over-year cost trend bending 'the wrong way.' It focuses on future actions rather than explaining the current disconnect. Conversely, the answer regarding Treasury and Trade Solutions monetization is quite direct, providing specific growth metrics and innovation examples. The partial evasion on the first, more critical question weighs on the overall clarity.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Vivek Juneja (Analyst): Couple of questions. Number one, so capital, Jane and Mark, going back to that, should we expect that given what you've mentioned, given everything going on in the regulatory environment, ratio you're at currently, it should grow in anticipation of what may come or likely to come with all the regulatory stuff? Or are you going to try and keep that closer to the 13.3%?\n",
      "Jane Fraser (CEO): I think we're going to see exactly what the framework is that comes out and then the implementation time frame for it and then look at making adjustments to plan, also hoping that the comment period is taken seriously and the different considerations I talked about earlier are taken into effect. Then we'll work through what are adjustments we make, pricing capital reallocation, etc., the playbook that you would expect the same one that we've done with SA-CCR and we've done with a number of other pieces. And we would also hope to see our SCB in a different place for the same reasons we talked about earlier Vivek, because there's a lot of volatility in that SCB dependent on the scenario that comes out every year. And I would say, given the shifts we're making in the business model, we'd expect to see that one come down.\n",
      "Mark Mason (CFO): The only thing I'd add is again, the Common Equity Tier 1 ratio of the 13.3% as of October 1, would be a 12.3% reg required level and 100 basis points of the management buffer. So that would be what we’d be held to as of October 1. As Jane mentioned, the NPR as it comes out, we'll take a look at that and see if there are implications on the Common Equity Tier 1 stack, but more likely implications on the risk-weighted assets, right? And what's really important there aside from the very important points Jane made in terms of considering broader factors is the timing of the implementation of whatever that final rule includes and obviously, the more timing for implementation, the more of an ability it gets for the industry to think about how to absorb the implications there.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 4, Justification: The executives avoid directly answering whether they intend to grow or maintain their capital ratio. They defer any decision until the final regulatory framework and its implementation timeline are clear, essentially providing a conditional non-answer. Their responses explain why they cannot give a definitive strategy rather than providing one.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Glenn Schorr (Analyst): So, I'm curious, you mentioned that you're still marching towards the 11%, 12%, which is good because everyone was going to ask that. My question is a little bit different of, with the denominator going up 25%, in other words, a lot of things are working towards your Transformation, but there's sort of a curve ball in there with upping the denominator by 25%. So, you seem to be a beneficiary of higher for longer for sure. And you also mentioned you're working on mitigation as we speak. So, maybe you could talk about what are the offsets that we don't see that give you confidence still working towards that, because the top line stuff is working?\n",
      "Mark Mason (CFO): So, good morning, Glenn, it's good to hear from you. Let me make a couple comments on that, and then, Jane, feel free to chime in if you'd like. The first thing is that when I talked about this at the last conference we attended, I mentioned that analysts were somewhere in the 16% to 19% range in terms of a capital increase, and we're likely to be inside of that range, assuming the Basel III proposal as it’ s structured, as it's written, and obviously that's not the final, there's a period of review that's going on now.\n",
      "What I'd say is a couple things, Glenn. One, we haven't fully executed against the strategy that Jane has just described. And obviously, continuing to simplify the business, managing through the Transformation, changing that business mix that we have to something that's more consistent and predictable and repeatable as it relates to PPNR, those things matter and impact the SCB. We talked about the exiting of the international consumer businesses. That will be a factor in what our balance sheet looks like and what stress losses might look like as well as lowering the expense base, which we know is an important factor in that PPNR math as well. And so, those things help, I think, to reduce the amount of capital that might be required as we get into that medium-term period.\n",
      "Importantly, as you point out, there are other elements of the proposal that are going to require that we take a hard look at as well and identify mitigating actions to the extent that they make it into the final. So, think about the increase in operational risk and the fact that some of that is already included in SCB as something of a point of advocacy. But that's obviously a big headwind that we'll have to kind of work through, the FRTB and the enhancement of models. Now, there's a global market shock as well, but again another point of advocacy that we need to work through.\n",
      "The equity investments, and now that they go from 100% risk weighting to 400% risk weighting, I think we're going to take a hard look at whether those are worth keeping in light of the higher capital associated with them. That's going to challenge the returns, that's going to force us to look at those through a different strategic lens, and we're going to do that. And that's not to even mention the credit component that impacts both corporates and consumers as it relates to unfunded commitments, for example.\n",
      "And so, as we've done with SA-CCR and other types of reg changes, we're going to have to look at what it means for our product mix, the returns associated with those, whether there are opportunities to pull levers like pricing, or whether we have to take other decisions around those. And so, that's what I mean by the mitigating actions that we're dimensioning and putting on paper and working through, but again, want to be thoughtful because the rule is not final yet, and there are more discussions to be had around those important elements that I mentioned already.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 2, Justification: The CFO directly addresses the question about offsets by detailing several strategic actions (e.g., simplifying the business, exiting international consumer businesses) and specific responses to Basel III components (e.g., re-evaluating equity investments, advocating on operational risk). While not providing a precise quantitative breakdown, the answer clearly outlines the types of mitigating actions and their confidence in reaching the target despite the increased capital requirements.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Vivek Juneja (Analyst): Completely unrelated, if I may. Noninterest-bearing deposits, what are you seeing given you're very heavily corporate driven. When I look at your point-to-point because you don't give a full average balance sheet, it's only interest-bearing related. But the noninterest-bearing is only available on a period end. If I look at that, there was a big drop in the U.S. this quarter. Anything unusual? Is that accelerating? What are you seeing amongst your clients, people still waking up? And what have you factored into your Net Interest Income guidance for that?\n",
      "Mark Mason (CFO): Well, again, I think the point I'd make here is that we continue to see clients shift from kind of noninterest-bearing deposits and into both interest-bearing and CDs and other higher-yielding products in light of the rate environment that we're in. And I would expect us to continue to see those types of shifts subject to how rates continue to evolve. And again, on the corporate side, we've seen in the U.S. clients have reached kind of those terminal, that terminal level, terminal betas, I should say, outside of the U.S. rate hikes, I think, are still in the future, as Jane alluded to, and the terminal betas have not quite yet been reached. But in terms of the noninterest-bearing, we are seeing that dynamic play out.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 4, Justification: The CFO confirms the general trend of clients shifting from noninterest-bearing to interest-bearing deposits, and discusses client behavior and 'terminal betas.' However, the answer avoids directly confirming the specific magnitude of the drop ('big drop') or its acceleration. Crucially, the CFO completely omits addressing the question about what has been factored into the Net Interest Income guidance regarding these deposits.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Ebrahim Poonawala (Analyst): Good morning. Just maybe, Mark, following up on that, as we think about bending the curve through the end of next year, maybe if you can talk to around as we think about the puts and takes between investments and expense saves, how much of that cost save or bending the curve is going to happen in Legacy versus PBWM and ICG? Like, just how do you break, how should we think about that as we think about bending the curve and where the savings are coming from?\n",
      "Mark Mason (CFO): Well, look, next year, we talked about expenses coming down from third quarter to fourth quarter. And as we think about that, you'll have some of the benefits of the costs going away from the exits that we would have announced. You have some of the benefit from further reduction in stranded cost, which we've been keenly focused on as we've exited each of these.\n",
      "And then I think as we get to the medium term, you will start to see some of the benefits from the Transformation spend and investments that we would have made start to play out, as well as efficiencies that we start to get in a lower structural cost base. But again, that's in that medium-term period. So, all of those things will be drivers to getting the bending of the curve. I haven't broken down, I'm not going to break down here on this call how much comes from each of the pieces, but all are important factors to achieving that.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 4, Justification: The analyst specifically asked for a breakdown of cost savings across different business segments (Legacy, PBWM, and ICG). The CFO directly stated, \"I haven't broken down, I'm not going to break down here on this call how much comes from each of the pieces.\" While general drivers for cost reduction were mentioned, the core of the question regarding segment-specific contributions was explicitly avoided.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Ryan Kenny (Analyst): Hey good morning. On the capital markets side, I heard the comments around it being hard to predict when deal activity will sustainably rebound. Can you just give us an update or more color on how CEOs are thinking about bringing deals live across Mergers & Acquisitions, Equity Capital Markets and Debt Capital Markets? And does the market and rate volatility over the last few weeks have any significant impact on bringing deals to completion or on the pipeline?\n",
      "Jane Fraser (CEO): Well, I think a couple pieces. I actually start with Q3 is the seventh quarter of the current Investment Banking Return on Average Tangible Common Equity: Return on Average Tangible downturn. So, since 2000, downturns have tended not to last longer than seven quarters because that's often how long it takes for pricing expectations to fully adjust to new realities. And we're starting to see that particularly in the debt capital markets, investment grade markets, where the expectation of no longer how high, but how long for rates, we've seen clients who get off the sidelines and just bite the bullet and get into the debt capital markets in a more meaningful way and no longer waiting on that.\n",
      "We still think that how our recovery and return to normal wallet plays out, when you talk to CEOs, is largely dependent on the macro environment. That's the main piece for them. Equity Capital Markets, we're seeing increased interest and activity on Equity Capital Markets. You obviously had several IPOs coming to market in September, three big ones that we were involved in. But the market is still somewhat fragile. We're watching it closely. And quite a few questions in Q4, things may move to Q1. We just have to see how that unfolds. But there's a good pipeline. I mean, there's a lot of pent-up demand here.\n",
      "In debt, we had a big pick-up in Debt Capital Markets. We feel confident that the gradual recovery in Debt Capital Markets and the beginnings of that lev fin one will continue. You're certainly going the see us more active in the lev fin space in the right situations for our key clients.\n",
      "And then in Mergers & Acquisitions, a healthy Mergers & Acquisitions sell-side pipeline. A lot of companies with their industries transforming are really wanting to think big. I think we'll see that unlocking when sentiment improves further, companies do accept the new pricing reality, which will be helped by a rebound in equity markets. That obviously, from our end, takes quite a few quarters to materialize into revenue just given the nature of the product.\n",
      "So, it's there, but I think just given where everything is geopolitically and particularly from the macro, no one is going to make that call as to when we're going to see that sustainable turn in banking at this point.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 2, Justification: The CEO provides specific insights into how CEOs are approaching deals across Debt Capital Markets, Equity Capital Markets, and Mergers & Acquisitions. While acknowledging uncertainty about a sustainable rebound, the answer directly addresses the impact of market volatility on deal timing and client sentiment within each segment, making it mostly direct.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Steven Chubak (Analyst): Hi good morning. So, Mark and Jane, I do recognize you'll provide a more fulsome update on expense actions next quarter, but one of the things I was hoping was that you could frame the expense opportunity in the context of your headcount trends. And prior to COVID, as well as the consent order, mind you, Citi was running with 200,000 direct staff. That number is closer to 240,000 today. It's an increase of 20%, even with multiple divestitures that you've consummated. So how should we think about an appropriate target or an optimal level of headcount for Citi versus that pre-COVID baseline of 200,000, and whether the consent order would impact the timing or magnitude of such headcount actions?\n",
      "Mark Mason (CFO): So, look, I'm not going to give you headcount guidance, but what I will say is Jane has talked before about the heads associated with the divestitures that are underway. And obviously as we continue to progress in those divestitures, we've made a lot of progress already, we'll see those heads come down. It's also important to point out that as part of our effort, there's been in-sourcing. And so, we've captured the extended workforce in the headcount that we have here.\n",
      "And then I think the final point is that as we continue to execute against the Transformation work, and as we implement the org simplification that we've just announced, undoubtedly the technology investment, the automation that we're putting in place, the straight-through processing that occurs, the fewer reconciliations that are required, the streamlining from all of those layers that Jane mentioned we'll be eliminating, all of those things will also work to reduce headcount as well.\n",
      "And so, while we're investing and hiring on the front-end to capture the upside as markets turn, but also as we position ourselves to grow with clients, we're also going to realize efficiencies that come out of headcount reduction.\n",
      "One additional point is that you've heard me mention before that we've taken probably about $600 million or so year-to-date in repositioning charges. And with that will come roughly 7,000 or so headcount coming down associated with those repositioning charges. And so, and we'll continue to do that, by the way, we haven't even begun to take repositioning charges associated with the org simplification that's underway. That will come in the fourth quarter and then the first quarter of next year. And so, we will see heads continue to evolve through this process, but keep in mind that there are puts and takes associated with that as we look at where we need to in-source versus use external parties.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 4, Justification: The CFO explicitly refused to provide \"headcount guidance\" or an \"optimal level of headcount,\" directly sidestepping the core quantitative part of the analyst's question. While he discussed various factors influencing headcount reductions and gave a past reduction number, he avoided providing any forward-looking target or directly addressing the impact of the consent order on timing or magnitude.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Gerard Cassidy (Analyst): Mark, you mentioned in the credit section that the delinquencies are rising, and as a percentage of loans, they're still very low. I was just curious on the corporate loans in North America there was an uptick. Again, I know relative to the portfolio, it's not that big. But anything in particular you can share with us in that area?\n",
      "Mark Mason (CFO): On the corporate loans, we saw loss, I think losses were $51 million in the quarter, so a small amount. We did see an uptick, as you point out, in the reserves. That was really driven by some country rating adjustments that were made. And then we did see an increase in the NALs, the non-accrual loans. And that was really one or two names and one in North America, one in EMEA. Both of them are current. But they drove the uptick that we saw in the quarter there.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 1, Justification: The CFO directly addresses the analyst's query about the uptick in corporate loan delinquencies and non-accruals in North America. He provides specific details, attributing the increase in reserves to country rating adjustments and the rise in non-accrual loans to one or two specific names, including one in North America, clarifying their current status.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Saul Martinez (Analyst): Hi there. So, I wanted to continue on the thread of normalization of credit losses. And you guys have, I guess your guidance is implying that Branded Cards and Retail Services get back to more normalized levels by year-end, which is a decent-sized uptick over the levels you had in the third quarter. So, I kind of want to know what's driving that view. But more importantly I guess, what does that imply going forward? And does it imply that we get to more, something more like above trend losses? Because I would think we still have some seasoning to go on the late 2021 and 2022 vintages.\n",
      "And not only that, but we’re talking about this in an environment where we still have pretty extraordinary labor markets. So, if you could just give us a little bit more color on just your expectations on credit losses and whether there's maybe a little bit more risk than we're thinking in terms of losses trending to something that is a bit higher than what we normally, or what are more normalized levels?\n",
      "Mark Mason (CFO): Yes. So, let me start on that, and then, Jane, if you want to chime in, that's fine. I think what I'd point you to is page 24 in the deck that we have because it gives you a nice snapshot of how both the loss rates have been trending but also how the delinquencies have been trending. And you can see that the delinquencies have been trending up, and that kind of gives us a good indication of where loss rates are likely to trend in the next quarter or so.\n",
      "And so, at 2.72% on Branded Cards and 4.53% on Retail Services, we can see that we're likely to end up at about that normalized rate by the end of the year getting up to the 3-3.25%, 5-5.50% pre-COVID normalized Net Credit Loss rates.\n",
      "Our expectation is that as we go into 2024, to the point that you've made, depending on the macro environment, we're likely to see this tick up above those pre-COVID normalized rates, as we see a slowdown in the economy, again, subject to what the macro looks like, before then kind of settling down at some point, down the path. And so, yes, we do see that tick up.\n",
      "This is again as advertised, so to speak, as we would have expected. And we have reserves, significant reserves for both of these portfolios to account for those loss expectations. So, in Branded Cards, we sit with an Allowance for Credit Losses to loan reserve of 6.3%, and Retail Services, we have 11%. Jane mentioned earlier that the losses in Retail Services ultimately get shared with partners. And so, while we would expect this to normalize and mature, so to speak, we feel very well-reserved for what that might look like.\n",
      "Jane Fraser (CEO): And our portfolio is very prime. I mean, this is not the old Citi. It's very different in terms of our consumer credit exposure. And I think what you're hearing from us is, this should all be very manageable.\n",
      "We're not, there's no alarm bells going off at Citi around this. We're being prudent. We're being conservative around pieces and responsible on it. But there's no alarm bells ringing. And I think that there may be a bit of a disconnect from some of the questions out there versus how we're feeling. We're just not seeing the data that is overly concerning. This is all very manageable, and we're being prudent about it, as you'd expect us to be.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 1, Justification: The CFO directly addressed all parts of the analyst's multi-faceted question. He explained the basis for their normalization view, confirmed the expectation of losses ticking up above pre-COVID normalized rates in 2024, and assured that they are well-reserved to manage these expected trends. The answer was specific and clear, directly acknowledging the potential for losses to exceed normalized levels.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Matt O'Connor (Analyst): Hi. There were some quotes, I think, in the media, Jane, from you talking about some signs of pressure among the lower end of the consumer, and I appreciate the pie chart that you have in the deck showing it's not a huge percent of the card portfolio. But could you elaborate on that? And then also just address the, you mentioned directionally how the payment rates in cards are coming down, but if we look at the growth in spend versus the growth in loans, it is kind of a little disproportionate. I think spend is up a couple percent year-over-year, and the loans are 11%. So, as we think about being kind of later-cycle, is that something that you're paying attention to as a potential sign of further weakness in credit?\n",
      "Jane Fraser (CEO): Yeah. Look, I think most of the pressure in the lower Fair Isaacson Company, we don't have a lot of customers in lower Fair Isaacson Company, so, we're seeing it out in the market. We've got, we obviously have some in the Retail Services business, we also, I would say, have the benefit of that loss sharing agreement that really makes a difference there because we're having to reserve fully for that, but we get it back on the revenue line, as you know.\n",
      "But as we look at the off-us book, as we look at some of the pressures in the market, as we look at spending, we can certainly see some of that pressure for the lower Fair Isaacson Company, whereas when I think about the cards business, it's very much driven by the affluent customer. So, the affluent is accounting for almost all the spending growth that we're seeing.\n",
      "And that's similar for the numbers that we saw coming out of the Fed from the deposit side, the excess savings are sitting there now primarily with households with over $150,000 of income, and it's down in the rest.\n",
      "So, these are things we're keeping an eye on. I want to be very clear, I'm not that worried about it for Citi given the prime nature of our card portfolio, and then the rest of our PBWM exposure is obviously very affluent.\n",
      "But when I look out at the market, I talk to our corporate clients, that's where we tend to see them being more nervous about the softness in the consumer. And just, I call it they're much more mindful about where they're spending, right? So, you're seeing them moving down within a category. They're certainly looking more on the bargain front. We've been hearing that from our retail partners. We've been hearing that across the board. So, growth of card loans is good. Our spend is up, but less than loans. I think it's softening, but it's not worrying.\n",
      "Mark Mason (CFO): Yeah. I think that's spot on, Jane. The only thing I'd add is that when you look at the payment rates in Branded Cards, while they've started to come down, they're still above the pre-COVID level. And we obviously have invested in this business. So, the other thing that's driving this is the new account acquisitions are obviously important drivers of that spend volume and ultimately that loan growth. But again, there's nothing that we see outside of what we were expecting in terms of how this portfolio is normalizing.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 1, Justification: The executives directly addressed both parts of the analyst's question. Jane elaborated on the observed consumer pressures while clearly explaining Citi's limited exposure and mitigating factors. Both executives then provided specific context for the disproportionate spend-to-loan growth, attributing it to new account acquisitions and portfolio normalization, and directly stated it was not a sign of concern for them.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Jim Mitchell (Analyst): Well, that's an important clarification that the $2 billion to $2.5 billion includes revenue-related volume growth, so that's helpful. And then, just maybe the other, on the slides talking about revenue targets. One of the big numbers not talked about was Markets. How are you thinking, volatility has come in, macro picture’ s getting better, maybe that mutes volatility, how do you think about that business in 2024 as it relates to your guidance?\n",
      "Mark Mason (CFO): As you know, it's a tough business to forecast, certainly, for a full year, and in some instances for a quarter, and so, we've basically kind of backed that out but we assume markets kind of flat to modestly down, but we've backed it out, and it's roughly flat. Not of the $80 billion to $81 billion, right, you see the guidance of Non-interest Revenue ex- Markets and Net Interest Income ex-Markets, so in the $80 billion to $81 billion, we've assumed it roughly flat.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 1, Justification: The CFO directly addresses how the Markets business is factored into their 2024 guidance. He explicitly states it's assumed to be \"roughly flat\" within the overall revenue target, even while acknowledging its difficulty to forecast and its exclusion from the 'ex-Markets' guidance figures.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "John McDonald (Analyst): Okay. And just as an expense follow-up, I wasn't clear. Has the transformation spend peaked, when you think about what you'll spend on transformation this year versus last year? And are the transformation benefits starting to kick in at this point?\n",
      "Mark Mason (CFO): Yeah. So to be clear, we're going to continue to spend whatever we need to spend on the transformation and on risk and controls. And so, we did see a tick up this year. We've got a plan for 2024, and if we've got to spend a bit more than we spent this year, we're going to spend more. That's what the plan calls for, and so that's what we'll do. That's inside of the number that I've given you for guidance, all right. And so, that's important for us. I think it will drive, obviously, operational improvement and saves down the line.\n",
      "It is part of the $2 billion to $2.5 billion, but that is the early stage, if you will, of the transformation spend paying back. I think as we talked about at Investor Day, frankly, we'll continue to see expense benefits beyond the medium term from some of this transformation investment that we've been making. And so, I would think of the medium term as the start of the benefits that we'll see from the investments we've been making in transformation and risk and controls.\n",
      "Jane Fraser (CEO): Yeah. I think, Mark, you're spot on. So we'll continue making the investments we need to in the transformation. It's a multi-year journey, as we've always been clear around this, ultimately, with benefits to the shareholders. And more of the expense saves that we've been talking about are, I'd separate out transformation from sort of the operating expense base of our businesses, which we want to make sure is as productive and as effective as possible.\n",
      "And the types of benefits we're seeing. This is the second year in a row that we've retired 6% of our legacy platform base. And you've heard me talking about moving 20 of our cash equity platforms on to 1, 6 reporting ledgers on to 1, 11 sanctioned platforms on to 1. So we start seeing some of the benefits of those come in.\n",
      "Other things, we automated independent price verification for 90% of our prioritized fixed income and equity securities. That's reduced manual controls. That's improved valuation consistency. That's also had an impact on the efficiency of the business.\n",
      "We've loaded 98% of our prioritized wholesale and consumer data into two authorized repositories. That will also begin to start having some benefits for us.\n",
      "So there is a cumulative effect that is beginning to build now from all the work we've done, but it will take some time to really kick into the, as Mark said, when you really feel it, is a few years out. But we'll keep giving you the proof points of things as we're going, so it's not a just trust us that it’ s coming, you'll begin to see it build.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 1, Justification: The executives directly answer both parts of the analyst's question. They clearly state that transformation spend has not peaked and they will continue to invest, and provide specific examples of transformation benefits that are beginning to kick in, while also clarifying that the full impact will be felt over a multi-year period.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Gerard Cassidy (Analyst): Good morning, Jane and good morning Mark. Jane, as you pointed out, you're very excited about the opportunities in Treasury and Trade Solutions. You're winning some new mandates in the custody business. Can you feel is it because the competition is struggling with other issues? What gives you, because Citi has always been well-regarded in this area, so what gives you that added excitement that this is even getting better?\n",
      "Jane Fraser (CEO): Look, I think the added excitement is, a lot of it's coming from the investments that we've been making. So that we are, if you look at it in terms of Payment Express, which is live in the U.S., Thailand, it’s on track for three more markets, that is really a very differentiating capability.\n",
      "The momentum we have in 24/7 clearing that's been put in place, we've had over $1 billion processed year-to-date. Putting our Commercial Bank clients onto CitiDirect so they have seamless access to our whole Treasury and Trade Solutions network globally. You heard us talking about Citi Token Services, you can see us innovating with the Fed in new capabilities.\n",
      "So really across the board, it's that innovation in cutting-edge, first-in-the-market type of capabilities. But you're putting that on top of a network that's just unprecedented in terms of its presence, its local capabilities, its payroll, cash management, liquidity management, its collections, its receivables, all sitting on one platform connected globally. And what that gives a client in terms of efficiency saves, insights on data, what they can do in terms of risk management and how to really optimize their treasury capabilities. I mean, this thing is a thing of beauty. And it's very, very hard, it's very sticky, to extricate from this because it's embedded into how our clients do business, it's that critical and into their technology systems.\n",
      "So, when you look at where the world's headed and what's going on in the world, volatility, these other elements, it's hard not to see opportunities.\n",
      "And it's opportunities as well with our Markets business linked in. One of our really differentiating factors that Andy Morton talks about all the time is his partnership with Treasury and Trade Solutions. The fact that one of our major client bases are corporates and they have a different profile, let's say, to an asset manager or a hedge fund. And we uniquely can serve them. So, that's the piece. It's that combination in trends we see.\n",
      "Mark Mason (CFO): I think that's spot on, Jane. The only thing I'd add is that the middle market commercial space is a huge opportunity for us, as you said earlier, leveraging that Treasury and Trade Solutions platform. And then on the Securities Services side, the reality is that we're finally seeing real traction in North America, right? We've always had kind of strength in many of the other regions, but we're really winning some major mandates here in North America, which I think is enough to get really excited about.\n",
      "Jane Fraser (CEO): And I think that, to me, is what then drives a lot of the strategy and what we're trying to do in terms of get to that high quality of earnings, better earnings mix, and other pieces that will help us get to that medium-term return target that we are so focused on.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 4, Justification: The analyst explicitly asked if the \"added excitement\" was due to competitors struggling. The CEO's response extensively detailed Citi's internal investments and capabilities, explaining why Citi itself is performing well. However, it completely sidestepped the direct question regarding the competitive landscape or competitors' difficulties, instead redirecting to internal strengths.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Erika Najarian (Analyst): Good morning. You've talked a lot about defense, as I like to call it, in terms of the Transformation that Jane had outlined and bending the expense curve. But I'm wondering, for both Jane and Mark, if you could sort of address what I think is probably the most debated part of your target, which is that revenue Compound Annual Growth Rate of 5%. You put up a very nice quarter in terms of revenues, both net interest income and fees. And maybe help us sort of look underneath the surface in terms of that momentum and maybe break it down in terms of what's really going well. I think Treasury and Trade Solutions continues to surprise to the upside, are we going to be, two years from now, we’ re going to be like, oh, well, Treasury and Trade Solutions is continuing to be doing well. So, what are the businesses that really sort of strong secular momentum that you feel is being under-recognized versus how you could position cyclically and higher for longer? And what is still to come as we think about that path to at least the numerator of that Return on Average Tangible Common Equity target?\n",
      "Jane Fraser (CEO): I love this question, Erika, because I have to say I’ m really excited about our strategy and the potential it has. And it is, as you say, this is about the revenue potential of the firm and really how do we continue to unlock it.\n",
      "So, there’ s a couple of unstoppable trends that we’ re going to be riding in the next, I think it’ s decade-long. The corporate client of today, and indeed consumer, has to build resiliency. The multinational client is on a long-term trend of building resiliency, be it because of green, be it because of geopolitics, be it because of regulatory, whatever the different reasons may be, and there are multiple, they're having to build resiliency into supply chains, into their own operations as they operate around the world. We’re the bank that is absolutely there for them. And I think you've seen that in Treasury and Trade Solutions, where we've had such strong drivers of growth in the last few years at the beginning of this trend. So, that is an important one. Wherever the clients want to go, we are there. We have been there for decades. We understand the risk. We understand the client base. We understand the opportunities there, at that. That micro level and local levels that someone who is flying in with a suitcase can't possibly deliver. And it's connected globally. So, this thing is just a thing of beauty.\n",
      "Linked into it is what I think of as a hidden gem amongst our crown jewels is Securities Services. It equally in custody has this extraordinary global network, the connectivity everywhere. We have been investing behind this business. We've been growing our market share in North America in asset managers, where we've been underweight, with a number of material marquee wins. You can see the share gain that we're getting in this business, the pipeline of deals that we've already won as well as the new pipelines going forward. Very high return. We're investing both in terms of our cloud, our data, our client experience. And this is in a way, let's say, I do view this as a hidden gem with extremely attractive return profile, fee profile, and other dimensions to it. We've quite a long way to run here. So, similar story to Treasury and Trade Solutions, slightly different client base, competitively advantaged because you've got both the pre-trade and the post-trade. We connect the two. Huge efficiencies for clients. That's going to matter.\n",
      "Next trend that's unstoppable, global wealth creation. And there is just going to be massive global wealth creation. I can't tell you how excited Andy Sieg is now that he's in the building and knows the way to his desk and all the floors his people are on. He's about to hit the road globally. We are so well positioned to deliver against that. And as you can see, we've not been happy with our performance the last couple of years, but this is going to be a very important driver for us.\n",
      "We'll see the recovery in banking wallet eventually. None of us are calling when that will sustainably happen. That will be another driver. And I'd say cards continuing to go from strength to strength, particularly I think as we look forward, playing to our lending-led model there.\n",
      "And finally the other one I do love, which is our Commercial Bank. We serve these entrepreneurs all over the world, who are going to be the drivers of many industries going forward. And we're serving them, helping them go international for the first step, tap them into global supply chains and the like. It's almost by definition the fastest growing of the mid-market companies are the ones that tap into what we can offer them. We build great relationships with them. And then our private bankers call on them, and then our investment bankers call on them. We have our capital market teams calling on them. And we help them grow and succeed. And that is going to be a big engine in the medium-term of new client acquisition feeding us.\n",
      "So, deeper client relationships, more growth in terms of new clients that fit with our proposition fairly uniquely, and some great mega trends that we are going to be riding and pretty uniquely positioned on. And we'll keep investing to make sure that where areas we're behind we get into the forefront of and the areas we are crushing it in, like our win rate is 82% in Treasury and Trade Solutions, and we're going to make sure that we continue to do so and innovate that way. So, sorry to be so excited about this, the 4% to 5% just feels very, very doable to Mark and I.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 1, Justification: The CEO directly addressed the question about the 5% revenue CAGR by detailing multiple specific business lines (Treasury and Trade Solutions, Securities Services, Global Wealth Management, Cards, Commercial Bank) and the \"unstoppable trends\" driving their growth. She clearly articulated what is \"going well\" and \"what is still to come,\" providing a thorough strategic breakdown of the firm's revenue momentum without deflection or vagueness.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Mike Mayo (Analyst): Hi, thanks for the follow-up. From your initial answer, Jane, I hear you with the restructuring, deconstructing Citi to global lines, delayering of management, and de-cluttering reporting. And when you add it all together, we'll get some numbers in January. But as it relates to your return targets and efficiency targets for 2025 and 2026, consensus is about one-third below what you target. And frankly, I have not spoken to one investor who thinks you're going to get those targets and maybe you would want to revise those lower in some way or maybe to be determined. Or what's your degree of conviction of getting to those targets or at least getting above your cost of capital?\n",
      "Jane Fraser (CEO): Yeah, look, we remain confident around our ability to hit these targets. We've got, you heard me talk earlier around the revenue growth and what are some of the tailwinds that we've got behind us as well as the core strategy and the drivers that we're in control of and that we've been investing behind to achieve. So, our strategy is unchanged, we're confident it will drive the revenue growth of 4% to 5%. It's not the primary purpose, but the org simplification is the third driver of the expense reductions that we've talked about.\n",
      "And I would also say that when you look at revenue, expenses, and the targets we've laid out at Investor Day, we've certainly had plenty of headwinds in macro, regulatory, geopolitics in the last couple of years. We have delivered on what we said we would do in the revenue, in the expense guidance, and on the strategy. We've made adaptions along the way as we've needed to. But I think that's the piece that we're also really trying to drive into the firm is a culture of we will do what we say we will do, and we'll adapt accordingly to different areas.\n",
      "Mark talked about adapting to the capital requirements, depending on what they are. We have other levers that we can pull, capital allocation, management buffer, Deferred Tax Assets. But my message to our investors is we're just building a proof point. This is a relentless execution. Look at that strategy scorecard page at the beginning of the deck there. We've achieved a lot and there is a lot going on, and we're getting a lot done. We don't pretend we're at the end of the road there, we're there yet. But we're getting done what we said we'd do and building up those proof points so that you can see us achieve those return targets.\n",
      "Anything to add, Mark?\n",
      "Mark Mason (CFO): As you said, building credibility and being transparent, right? So, we're going to keep delivering on the proof points, and we're going to be transparent about how and when and how we're going to achieve it.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 2, Justification: The CEO directly answers the question about conviction, stating they remain confident in hitting their targets. However, the response is somewhat vague regarding how they plan to bridge the significant gap between their targets and market consensus, and it avoids directly addressing the analyst's subtle suggestion of revising targets lower.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Vivek Juneja (Analyst): Hi Jane. Hi Mark. Want to just clarify the reorganization a little bit. So, Jane, I heard you say that you're keeping North Asia and South Asia heads. So, did you just get rid of the Asia head and get rid of the product heads, where product heads in each country were reporting to a regional product head? So, is that that dotted line is no longer there or what's going on there? And when you get rid of all the monthly management reporting, what are you planning to replace that with from your management, your MIS perspective?\n",
      "Jane Fraser (CEO): So, let me take the second one first. I'm not planning on replacing it with anything. We don't need them. We're no longer running consumer franchises in the countries. Instead, we've got global businesses that are operating very consistently in the individual geographies, so we just don't need to replace them. And it enables us just to have the legal entity, financial management that we need. And then our internal reports get greatly simplified. Same as they get greatly simplified by taking out ICG and PBWM is another, eliminating that layer also eliminates a lot of different reports. So, the wonderful answer is, nothing, a simpler Citi.\n",
      "The first question was about, okay, help you understand what we've done. So, on the geography front, we have done two main things already. One is we've eliminated the regions and have just put a single international head reporting to me. So, that makes it much simpler for me. I have one international head, and then he will help us manage the geographies collectively.\n",
      "The second piece is we really narrowed the mandate of geography to delivering to our clients and covering our clients in their countries. And secondly, the legal entity management. And otherwise, before, we had a huge amount of management on shadow P&Ls and different, a lot of very heavy committee structure. That was necessary because the business was still very local, as a retail bank, a local credit card business, a local onshore wealth business. They've gone. It's just serving multinationals. The subsidiaries are multinationals and in some markets the investors and the wealth clients in some markets. And that's a much simpler business to manage. So, we could get rid of the regional layer, and we just jump straight down to the clusters that we have today. They too have less of a mandate than they had before, a much more focused one.\n",
      "And the bit that I'm excited about is not just, yes, this makes it much simpler to manage, but it also helps us really focus on the global network. Now, our geographies and our banking organizations sitting together on the same management structure are collectively accountable for serving and delivering against our core client base. And they're in one team to do it. It just makes it much easier. Does that give you a feel? What else, Mark?\n",
      "Mark Mason (CFO): The other thing, Vivek, that I think is important here is we really want to spend a little bit more investment in time on the client lens in terms of the financial reporting, right? Because, as Jane talked about, we talked about the synergies across the franchise that we can capture, the ability to leverage the offering we have for those different client segments. So, looking at that P&L, looking at those returns, looking at that growth opportunity through that client lens will be something where we want to enhance the metrics that we have already around that so that we can capture that upside.\n",
      "Jane Fraser (CEO): And around the other piece that I think is also just an important point, globalization is changing and we're seeing these lanes all changing through trade, financial flows, et cetera. By actually having a single international organization and then the different clusters, North and South Asia, Europe, UK, LATAM, Middle East, Africa, the connection points between them are really changing at the moment. And so, this makes us much more agile in our delivery of the global network because I think it's much more in line with how the world is operating today.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 2, Justification: The answer directly addressed the question regarding the elimination of monthly management reporting and the consolidation of regional leadership under a single international head. However, it did not explicitly confirm whether product heads and their regional reporting lines were eliminated, which was a specific part of the analyst's inquiry, leading to minor vagueness.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Mike Mayo (Analyst): Hi. I looked in detail at the earnings presentation, especially slide 4, and I think the question is, on many people's minds, I count 12 restructurings at Citigroup. And I count 12 restructurings that have failed at Citigroup. You might disagree with the number 12, It could be 5, it could be 8, it could be 12, it could be more, but I've not spoken to one person of any investor who would say that Citi has succeeded on its prior restructuring. So, the question is, why is this time different? Number one, who is this new and improved Citigroup. Number two, why aren't expenses down even move, especially when few people that I talk to think you'll hit your revenue target? And three, Jane, what is your conviction level of getting to that 11% to 12% Return on Average Tangible Common Equity in 2025 or 2026? Thank you.\n",
      "Jane Fraser (CEO): Well, thank you very much indeed, Mike. I'll start with, who is Citi? Citi is, I'm delighted to say, finally simple. At Investor Day, I set out a vision to be the preeminent banking partner for clients with cross border needs. That vision was based on five core interconnected businesses. We set off on a deliberate path to get there, and over the last three years we've done so.\n",
      "Page 4 is who we are today. We are five interconnected businesses; no more, no less. We have our organization that now aligns with those five businesses, and this enables us to focus on two priorities. The first is improving the performance and the returns of those five core businesses, so that we can meet the medium-term Return on Average Tangible Common Equity target we laid out. And the second is on addressing our regulatory issues through the transformation. And I would also be, I need to note that I fully recognize that 2024 is an inflection year, Mike. And I and the management team are accountable to deliver. And that you and our investors have the transparency you need to hold us accountable.\n",
      "So, why is this time different? Look, it's not lost on me that there's been many attempts in the past to change this firm. I and the management are fully committed to transforming this company for the long term and we are addressing the issues that have held us back in the past. And you've got proof points of the last three years where we've made a lot of tough decisions and we have put through a tremendous amount of change to get to the simple Citi that we are today. We completely reset our strategy. So, we now have a significantly more focused business and operating model.\n",
      "We've announced the most consequential set of changes to our organizational model, and frankly, from my perspective, more importantly, how we run the bank, since the financial crisis, aimed at simplifying the bank and increasing accountability. You've seen we’ve moved quickly. We're on track with our execution of this effort. And it will generate over $1 billion of run rate saves the end of the first quarter, purely from the organization efforts that we've put in that we announced in September.\n",
      "We've done this while investing and I think this is another difference. We've invested heavily in our transformation. And while that was catalyzed by our consent orders, these investments will ultimately deliver benefits from automation, from well-governed data, from consolidated platforms. We also have made significant investments in our business to support the 4% to 5% revenue growth and to ensure client momentum. And those investments have helped us expand our product suite, invest in digital capabilities, automate our processes, capture synergies through the client organization.\n",
      "We've also brought in some incredible external talent in key strategic areas, including Andy, to lead Wealth. And we now have a good balance between experienced Citi people and external talent with fresh perspectives through multiple layers of the organization.\n",
      "So, we are doing things the right way, we're doing it for the long term and we're moving with urgency. We will need and are spending the money that we need to, to address our regulatory requirements, but that's already embedded in our path to the 11% to 12% Return on Average Tangible Common Equity in the medium term. And this already feels like a different bank. We have more work to do. I recognize 2024 is a critical year, and as I said, the decks are much clearer now, so that we can focus on two imperatives: improving our business performance and executing the transformation. Neither is an entirely linear path as we've seen over the last three years. We all know that. We get we have to build our credibility. We're committed to doing so. And we are providing far more transparency around the business performance, so investors have a better sense of how we're doing. And I and my management team, to your final question, are fully accountable for getting this all done. We will.\n",
      "Mark, expenses?\n",
      "Mark Mason (CFO): Yeah, thanks, Jane. And why aren't expenses down more? I think to your point, Jane, we've been investing in the franchise both on the front-end, and importantly, on the transformation and the risk and controls. What I would point out is that, in 2023, we delivered expenses of $54.3 billion ex the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation charge. That is the guidance that we gave. But I also highlight that we also included $780 million associated with the restructuring charge. That is more than I had articulated in the way of guidance. So, the capacity that we created through our efforts through the year, we use that in a smart way. We use that to fund the org simplification cost, so that we can realize the savings down the line. And we're going to continue to manage our expenses in a disciplined and smart fashion. That means spending what we need to spend on the transformation and risk and controls, but driving greater efficiencies and productivities along the way to ensure we get to that 11% to 12%. And to your point, if revenues are to come down or come in lower than expected, we'll adjust the expenses accordingly.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 1, Justification: The management directly addresses all three parts of the analyst's multi-faceted question. Jane Fraser provides a detailed explanation for why \"this time is different\" and outlines the new Citi structure, while Mark Mason directly explains the expense situation, including reasons for current levels and future management. Both executives explicitly state their conviction and accountability for the financial targets, leaving little room for ambiguity or deflection.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Glenn Schorr (Analyst): Hi. Thanks very much. So, you're clearly making a lot of progress and I hate to like, ask this question too early, but I think it is important. Your expense guidance is good, your revenue guide is good, and you have your arms around the expenses. The question I have is, how do you think about balancing that near-term profitability improvement that we all want desperately with making sure you do make the right investments? Because if you look around the world there's a lot of places to grow, whether it be a branch network, or the wealth management aspirations that you have, or the digital investments. So, how do we know that all the right future investments are being made while you extract costs in all the good ways that you've been doing?\n",
      "Mark Mason (CFO): Yeah, thanks, Glenn. I guess, I'll start, and Jane, feel free to add in on it. Look, it is a balancing act, right, and we do look at each of our five core businesses. We obviously are clear on the strategy, but where's the growth? Where are the return opportunities associated with them? And how do we ensure we're deploying resources after them in order to deliver for the client and deliver on those returns over time? We have to juxtapose that against the required investment to modernize our operations and we're making those trade-offs on a regular basis. But importantly, when we do invest to capture those growth opportunities, we're trying to be agile about it, which means if those opportunities don't play out in the way we're expecting because the cycle just doesn't mature or materialize in that fashion, we've got to be disciplined enough to dial them back, and that's what you've seen over the past year plus, is that we've been investing in the business.\n",
      "Where we didn't see the upside that we anticipated, we dialed back that spend, right, and that's the type of iterative process, if you will, Glenn, that we're putting in place to ensure that on the other side of this, we're still positioned to capture growth. Investment Banking, for example, we have invested in healthcare, in technology, building out to prepare ourselves for when that market rebounds. We feel good about that. We've done similar things in the way of our Wealth business. We're investing heavily in our Treasury and Trade Solutions franchise to ensure we can remain competitive there, so it's that type of discipline that's required. It is sometimes a trade-off, but it's one that we've been very focused on being smart about.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 2, Justification: The CFO directly addresses the question by explaining their strategic approach to balancing near-term profitability with future investments. They detail their process of evaluating growth opportunities, deploying resources, and being agile to dial back spend if needed, providing relevant examples of investment areas. While not providing a granular breakdown, the answer directly addresses the 'how' of their decision-making.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Gerard Cassidy (Analyst): Good afternoon, Mark, Jane. Mark, can you share with us, in your revenue guide, in the net interest income, I know you mentioned it's going to be lower and part of it is due to lower interest rates. Some of your peers have come out with their guides using the forward curve in their net interest income forecast which includes the Fed in our country, six cuts. Can you give us some color what kind of rate environment, I know you said lower rates, but any insights around that guide?\n",
      "Mark Mason (CFO): Yeah, I think what I'd point you to is in the range of the $80 billion to $81 billion, we're assuming three to six cuts, right. You've got a range there and the reason I described it like that is that, if you think about our IRE, as we've shown it in the Qs before, we're positioned such that, with 100 basis point move, parallel shift in rate across the curve, the US dollar impact would only be a couple hundred million dollars, all right, and so, to the negative, obviously, but it's a couple hundred million dollars. And so as we think about that forecast, and as I mentioned, Net Interest Income being down a bit, that covers kind of three to six cuts over the course of 2024, likely back-loaded, but that's what's in there.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 1, Justification: The CFO directly addresses the analyst's question about the assumed rate environment by stating that their revenue guide incorporates \"three to six cuts\" over the course of 2024. He further clarifies the bank's interest rate sensitivity, providing specific context for their Net Interest Income forecast. This is a very clear and specific response.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "John McDonald (Analyst): Hi good morning. Mark, was hoping to ask you, how are you thinking about the pacing of capital build? Obviously, the Basel III proposals are out there, but they could change, of course. Even if they don't change, you have a couple of years to leg into those with the phase-ins and perhaps some mitigation opportunities. How should we think about you kind of building capital, given all those variables and the ability to buy back some stock along the way as you mentioned earlier?\n",
      "Mark Mason (CFO): Sure, so look, John, obviously the Basel III proposal's still out there and under discussion. We've been very vocal about the potential impact of that. We've also been very disciplined about how we've been managing our capital. We've built that over 30 basis points over the course of the year. You've seen us actively manage that through the year, and we're going to continue to do that. We obviously generate earnings that contribute to that. We want to continue to drive growth across the business.\n",
      "We're trading at a 0.5 times book, where we can, we want to buy back as much as we can in shares. And we try to be disciplined about that over the past couple of quarters, doing that as a modest level. You heard me say, we're going to do that again this quarter at a modest level, but we have to be thoughtful about what those headwinds might look like. And we're actively working what mitigation actions we have to put in place, should it turn out closer to the way the current proposal sits.\n",
      "So, it's an ongoing active management that tries to balance servicing our client needs, with, obviously, holding a responsible amount of capital in light of the uncertainty that's out there, and with an eye towards buybacks where we can do that.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 4, Justification: The CFO's response largely avoids directly addressing the \"pacing of capital build\" as requested by the analyst. While it acknowledges regulatory uncertainty and mentions past capital accumulation and modest share buybacks, it provides only general statements about active management and balancing competing priorities, without offering specific insight into the future speed or strategy for capital build.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Ebrahim Poonawala (Analyst): Well said. Just what I needed. And one quick question. As we think about rightsizing the Markets business, there have been headlines around the muni and the distressed business that you've gotten out. Is there a risk where the Markets business becomes too small and you lag the scale to be sort of efficient and relevant in certain, or just across the breadth of, be it, fixed income or equities? Just if you can talk about that. Thank you.\n",
      "Jane Fraser (CEO): The short answer is no. If you think about our Markets business, we have four businesses, each of which are around sort of $4 billion or so in size. You have our global Foreign Exchange network, where we're typically number one in any year, just given the strength, and particularly, the corporate client base we've set off. Rates, typically top three. Together, these are two of the largest macro pools within FICC.\n",
      "In terms of the spread products, we've been putting our financing and securitization business as part of our simplification, fully within Markets, so that we've created a unified, scaled spreads product business. And then finally, equities, where we're focused on improving our prime offering, building balances. We still have a way to go obviously in that. Prime balances we're pleased they were nicely up this year, driven by client momentum. And we're a leading equities derivative franchise. So, you do have these four core businesses.\n",
      "And I'd go back to our big point of differentiation and why we feel we're well-positioned. We have a very differentiated corporate client base and very strong partnerships between our core Markets franchise, Treasury and Trade Solutions, and Banking and Securities Services, and that helps us in Foreign Exchange, in commodities and in rates around the world. So, Markets is important both in terms of its leadership, but also, how it fits into the strengths that we have from this simpler Citi of those five core interconnected businesses.\n",
      "We've demonstrated solid returns in the past. I think a lot of the actions we've been taking will help drive returns in the future. And you should be getting confidence when you see the discipline we're putting on to Risk-Weighted Assets, 5.3%, getting close that target, we said at Investor Day. We're moving that up to 6%. The exits we've got of nonstrategic businesses shows our focus on efficiency. And we've also been doing some good investments in our technology, and that's getting us into a good place there. So, I think, don't be concerned about the shrinking. We're just making sure that it really plays to our strengths and we optimize the returns.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 1, Justification: The CEO directly addresses the analyst's concern about the Markets business becoming too small by explicitly stating, \"The short answer is no.\" She then provides detailed explanations about the size and market positions of their core businesses, highlighting their strategic relevance and the rationale behind recent changes, directly refuting the premise of the question.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Scott Siefers (Analyst): I'm sorry. Yeah, just curious if you have assumed any revenue attrition related to the reduction in force over the coming year.\n",
      "Jane Fraser (CEO): Okay, no, no we haven't. I think a lot of the moves that we've made from the organization simplification, so the 5,000 or so roles we talked about, they're mainly managerial roles. And they've mainly impacted the functions and the geographies, not nearly so much the revenue from revenue generators.\n",
      "And the other piece is with the client organization, we're actually putting much more time into the hands of our people to drive revenue forward, so I think what we're looking at here is getting rid of areas of bureaucracy and where we've been too complicated, where we can drive efficiency whilst preserving our frontline and encouraging them to be as revenue-productive and delivering the full force of the firm to the client. So I like to see the opposite actually.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 1, Justification: The CEO directly answers the question by stating that no revenue attrition related to the reduction in force has been assumed. She then provides a clear explanation for this stance, detailing that the cuts are primarily in managerial and functional roles, not revenue-generating positions, and highlights efforts to improve revenue generation from client-facing staff.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Scott Siefers (Analyst): Perfect. All right. Thank you.\n",
      "Vivek Juneja (Analyst): Hi Jane, hi Mark. Couple of quick clarifications. On your Net Interest Income guide, you talked about you're assuming three to six cuts. That's US, I presume, so are you assuming flat, unchanged rates outside the US since you have more sensitivity outside?\n",
      "Mark Mason (CFO): Modest declines outside, but yes declines outside as well, but not nearly of the magnitude of what we're talking about in the US.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 1, Justification: The CFO directly addresses the analyst's clarification regarding non-US rate assumptions in the NII guide. He explicitly states that \"modest declines\" are assumed outside the US, directly refuting the \"flat\" assumption implied by the analyst's question. This provides a clear and specific answer.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Jim Mitchell (Analyst): Hey, good afternoon. Mark, maybe just to follow up on the expense, slide 22, where you talk about $2 billion to $2.5 billion of expense saves. I guess I'm struggling with the numbers there. I think if you look at exit and wind- down markets, you're probably close to $2 billion in numbers there. And maybe the stranded costs, you can't get all of that out. You're doing about – severance is $700 million to $1 billion in 2024. So doesn't seem like there's a ton of actual cost saves in that number. And just maybe I'm wrong, if you could just kind of walk me through the numbers embedded in there and if there's, you've kind of eluded to more to come beyond the intermediate term.\n",
      "Mark Mason (CFO): Yeah, I think the thing I'd point out to you is a couple things. One, obviously, we're forecasting revenue growth over this period of time. And so, there's going to be volume-related expenses associated with that.\n",
      "The second thing I'd point out, as I just mentioned to the prior question, is that we're continuing to invest in risk and controls and in the transformation over this period of time.\n",
      "And so, what you see is there's an increase in expenses associated with at least those two things. And that's offset by the savings that we're starting to generate, particularly from the org simplification that Jane has talked about, as well as from the stranded cost reduction that will continue to play out, as well as from some of the rightsizing of businesses that we've referenced in some of the prepared remarks.\n",
      "And then the final point that I'd make is if I look at this medium-term number of $51 billion to $53 billion that still has Mexico in it and one of the other pages we'd point to, expenses around Mexico. But because of where we are, we'll be in the IPO process, that's still going to be part of this expense base, and so you can't lose sight of that.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 4, Justification: The CFO avoided the analyst's specific request to \"walk me through the numbers embedded\" in the $2 billion to $2.5 billion expense saves. Instead, he discussed various factors that contribute to overall expenses (e.g., revenue growth, investments, Mexico inclusion) and listed general sources of savings without quantifying them or reconciling the stated figure. This response provides context for the overall expense base but sidesteps the detailed numerical breakdown requested.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Gerard Cassidy (Analyst): Very good, I appreciate that. And then, Jane, more of a qualitative question rather than quantitative, but obviously, there's numerous moving parts of the strategies that you guys are executing on, exiting businesses, downsizing businesses. Especially on the downsizing, I think you guys mentioned, the head count of about 20,000 coming down. How do you keep the morale of the organization elevated when you have these types of tough decisions that you all have to make?\n",
      "Jane Fraser (CEO): Yes. Well, we've also got areas which are growing, so that does help, too. We have a diversified portfolio here. I think we're very mindful of, that there is a human impact of the decisions that we're making. We're trying to be as transparent with our people, as we are with our investors about what we need to do, why we're doing it, what to expect and laying that out so people understand the logic behind the decisions, and then they understand what the decisions are as quickly as they can. I think that's the most humane way to do this.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 2, Justification: The CEO directly addresses the question about maintaining morale during a period of downsizing. She explains their strategy of transparency with employees about the rationale and implications of decisions, and also points to growing areas within the company as a positive factor. While not detailing specific morale-boosting programs, the answer provides a clear strategic approach to the challenge, making it mostly direct.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Matt O'Connor (Analyst): Okay, that was clear. And then, just separately in credit cards. You and a lot of your peers expect losses to go up from here, but most of you are saying, they're going to peak at this year, including you. Just what gives you confidence that the card losses will peak this year is it just getting back to that a little bit of a normalized level? Is it some tightening that you've done? What's driving that confidence, looking out this year? Because you're probably seeing a step-up coming still, right?\n",
      "Mark Mason (CFO): Sure ,there's a step-up coming. We gave a forecast on 2024 (sic), as you point out, to what the full-year estimate for Net Credit Losses will be for both Branded and for Retail Services. What I'd point out is, you can see actually on the slide how there was a dip in loss rates during the COVID period. And so to some extent, what we're seeing is kind of a catch up of those, as those portfolios go through a longer maturation than what you'd normally see in a cards portfolio.\n",
      "On top of that, we've been originating new card. You've noticed our acquisitions have grown, so we obviously have new card loans, and those are going through a much normal maturation period. And so, as we look at the early buckets and the delinquencies that are playing out, we've got a pretty good sense for when we would expect those to peak and at what level. And we think they'll peak inside of 2024, so that's captured in that average forecast that we've given.\n",
      "We haven't made material changes to our underwriting. However, there is mix evolution that happens. Transactors, we have a number of transactors that have kind of come on to our portfolio and are in the mix of our Branded portfolio as well. So, anyway, those are the drivers that give us confidence and inform the trajectory that we're talking about here.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 1, Justification: The CFO directly addresses the question about confidence in card losses peaking in 2024 by citing specific factors: the catch-up from the COVID-era dip in loss rates, the normal maturation of new card originations, and insights from early delinquency trends. The response also explicitly clarifies that there haven't been material changes to underwriting, but notes mix evolution, directly answering the analyst's query about potential tightening.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Jim Mitchell (Analyst): Okay, great. Thank you.\n",
      "Ebrahim Poonawala (Analyst): Morning, afternoon, Jane. Just wanted to follow up on something I think Mark said at the end of his very first response around, it's very hard in my seat to figure out whether you're going to grow revenues or shrink revenues given the macro. Should we take it based on what you've said today as we look into 2026 getting to that 11% Return on Average Tangible Common Equity, if for whatever reason, revenue falls short and you feel good about the expense flex to mitigate that headwind?\n",
      "Jane Fraser (CEO): It's Jane, obviously. I want to just jump in on one bit, which is we are committed and we're very confident around the 4% to 5% revenue growth rate, so there isn't any backing away from that number. And that's in various macro environments, et cetera. And as we look across the different businesses, and the projections we have, we're confident around that. Obviously, if there's a very adverse macro environment, et cetera, we've got other levers we can take, but Mark, let me pass it to you.\n",
      "Mark Mason (CFO): And by no means was I trying to suggest that we weren't confident in the forecast for the top line. If you think about the strategy and the strength of those five core businesses, we've got a lot of conviction around that. With that said, as you point out, Jane, under a circumstance where that doesn't play out, there are obviously volume-related incentive comp expenses and the like that would naturally come down. We'd ensure that they came down with the revenue decline or shortfall. And then we'd recalibrate other spend, other investments, spend not related to risk and controls and transformation, but other investments across the platform, we'd recalibrate accordingly.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 2, Justification: Management initially emphasizes confidence in hitting revenue growth targets, which is a mild deflection from the hypothetical 'if revenue falls short' scenario. However, they then provide concrete details on expense flexibility, such as adjusting variable compensation and recalibrating other investments, directly addressing how they would mitigate a shortfall. While they don't explicitly state 'yes, we feel good that this will ensure the 11% ROTCE target,' their specific examples imply confidence in their ability to manage expenses.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Glenn Schorr (Analyst): I appreciate that. Maybe a quickie on Services. Obviously, up 16% and a record is great. I don't know if you've dimensionalized how much was rate versus new business, but you have good core business momentum and a pipeline of won, but not yet funded. So I guess the question is, where can Services be over, let's say, the next two years in terms of growth, while rates come down, yet your businesses is winning new wins?\n",
      "Mark Mason (CFO): Yeah, sure. You want me to, sure.\n",
      "Jane Fraser (CEO): Yeah and I'll jump in, too. Let's maybe start with Treasury and Trade Solutions. When we think about the performance of Treasury and Trade Solutions, which, as we say, the growth this year up 19% ex-Argentina, came from a combination of both rates and the strong business actions we've taken. And you can see that in the different drivers. Cross-border was up 23%, commercial cards up 8%. In terms of the growth prospects, we've generated 22% in average revenue growth, from 21 to 23, well ahead of the Investor Day guidance we had of high-single digits. That was not just because of the rate cycle. It obviously helped. And we certainly expect to grow revenues at mid-single digit now as we lap the prior periods that benefited from those rate increases, and that's going to come from a few different areas.\n",
      "One, the focus on our fee strategy, where we're capitalizing on strong client engagement, market-leading client solutions, and we're delivering on a lot of the different growth initiatives that we've been investing in across all our client segments. We'll continue optimizing our deposit book and bringing in high-quality deposits. And in a lower rate environment, Gross Domestic Product is typically higher, so you'd expect to see some higher growth in our capital-efficient payment volumes.\n",
      "You'll see us continuing to acquire new clients and deepen relationships with existing clients. And I'd point to our confidence here, 27% increase in our new client acquisition this year and a sustained win/loss ratio of 82% on new deals, and that was across different client segments. And revenues from these clients just continues to ramp up, as we expand across the different geographies and product suites with them.\n",
      "And you'll also continue to see us investing in the infrastructure and platforms we've been doing, launching new innovative products. And we're seeing momentum from some of the things we've recently done: Citi Token Services, Payment Express, 24/7 Clearing, et cetera. So I think, the main takeaway from Treasury and Trade Solutions is that we'll continue to invest in it. We expect to see strong client momentum. We've been getting consistently good client feedback regarding our capabilities, so we expect to see good global growth that will certainly help as the rate cycle comes down. And it is a crown jewel for a reason.\n",
      "And then, just quickly on Securities Services. I think where we're seeing, we mentioned, we've got a number of marquee wins there across all the client segments. That pipeline is both investors and issuers. And one of the core strategies that Okan put in place was to grow share with the US-based asset managers. We were at 2.6% share in 2020; we're now at 4.3%.\n",
      "And a lot of the growth in the pipeline has been coming, not only from our global network names, but also from the marquee players in the US asset manager space. I think that's our ability to connect our capabilities that gives these players huge efficiencies for our clients.\n",
      "Mark, anything I've missed there? You know I love this business.\n",
      "Mark Mason (CFO): As you should rightfully so, high-returning business, great growth prospects. To answer one of your questions, Glenn, about half of the Net Interest Income growth, we could attribute to interest rates. And about half, I'd say, is business action, so us working with the clients to drive that momentum. And then, if you think about the noninterest revenue, for Services, they're up about 20% in the quarter year-over-year if you exclude the impact of the Argentina devaluation, and up 7% on a full year basis. And so, good momentum in the noninterest revenue growth as well.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 1, Justification: The executives provided a clear, forward-looking quantitative growth expectation for their primary Services segment (Treasury and Trade Solutions) as rates decline, stating 'mid-single digit' growth. They directly answered how much of past growth was attributable to rates versus new business action and extensively detailed the ongoing momentum and new wins driving future growth, fully addressing all parts of the analyst's question.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Scott Siefers (Analyst): Okay, perfect, thank you. And then, Mark, can you discuss for a second maybe, just broadly, the flow of expenses through the year? I know that they should begin to decline towards the end, but what happens between now and then? Do they hold kind of flattish with a core rate, or would there be any normal course of business growth?\n",
      "Mark Mason (CFO): I think what I'd say is that, you should expect it in the first quarter. We'd likely see an uptick in our total expenses relative to the fourth, in part because, as Jane has mentioned, we anticipate that there'll be more to the org simplification and, therefore, dollars associated with that in Q1. And then, from there, I would expect that you see a downward trend through the fourth quarter.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 1, Justification: The CFO provides a clear and specific outlook for expense flow, detailing an expected uptick in Q1 followed by a downward trend through Q4. This directly answers the analyst's question about the trajectory of expenses throughout the year and addresses whether they would hold flattish or grow before declining.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Mike Mayo (Analyst): Hi. Well, you just finished your seventh month of your org simplification and you said 7,000 positions go away, with $1.5 billion of expense savings. So that's very concrete, but more generally, after 20, 30, 40 years of matrix structure down to five lines of business, you're reporting these differently, you're talking about them differently, but the question that I think a lot of people have is, are you simply reporting these lines of business differently, or are you actually running them differently? Thanks.\n",
      "Jane Fraser (CEO): Thank you, Mike, for the question. The simplification that we've just gone through, it is what we said it is. It is the most consequential set of changes, not only to the organization model that we have but how we run the bank. It's aligned the structure with the strategy. It's simplified the bank. It's eliminated needless complexity. It's created greater transparency into the five businesses and their performance as you can see. It's increased accountability. And very simply, it's just easier for our people to focus on our clients, but also getting things done and the execution that we have ahead of us.\n",
      "So maybe if I try and bring this a bit more alive, the first thing we did was we elevated the five businesses and that eliminated the ICG and PBWM layer, and we brought all the elements that the businesses needed to run end-to-end under the direct management of those five business heads, an example being operations. It's enabled transparency, greater accountability, and this end-to-end and total P&L focus, so focus on the bottom line and the returns driving growth, expense discipline, etcetera.\n",
      "We also right-placed businesses to align with the strategy, so Banking all being under one umbrella, the Investment Bank, the Corporate Bank, Commercial Bank, really helping us drive synergies there. Putting Financing & Securitization and Securitization into Markets, so that we have a unified spread product there, also beginning to see the benefits of that this quarter.\n",
      "So, by eliminating the regional layer and putting in a far slimmer, lighter management structure in place in the geographies, that's enabled us to make sure that our countries are focused on client delivery and legal entity management, and we've eliminated the whole shadow geographic P&L. We've eliminated a large number of committees in the geographies, and this is where a lot of the functional and management roles were streamlined and eliminated through the last seven months. And we also broke the regions into smaller, lighter clusters, and that allows us to much better capture the big changes in trade flows and financial flows, etcetera we're seeing around the world. It's just much nimbler.\n",
      "The third piece, we created the client organization. So that organization makes sure that our core capabilities and disciplines are being applied firm-wide to drive revenue synergies. And then the governance has got a lot easier, it took up a lot of time, and we've given much clearer mandates and we've more than halved the number of committees. That's 200 committees-plus that we've eliminated in the firm, either by consolidating them or eliminating them.\n",
      "The spans and layers, if you exclude me, 98% of the firm now operates within eight layers. That is a much, much faster decision-making, it's much quicker to get execution done. It also means that you can very quickly get close to where the engine room of the firm is. We've got clearer accountabilities. We've eliminated most co-heads. We've reduced matrix reporting. We've got the producer to non-producer ratio improved. So all of this really means, as I've said, a clearer deck, so we can be laser-focused on business performance in those five businesses and the Transformation.\n",
      "It already feels different. Around my table, I'm much closer to the businesses and the clients. It makes it much easier for Mark and I and the rest of the team to run the bank like an operator versus the head of a holding company. You don't have to go through these aggregated layers to get things done.\n",
      "And we're done, as we said we would be at this point, we're wrapping up the final consultation periods. Not an easy few months for the organization. We've had to say goodbye to some very good people. We've put a lot of change through the organization. And now, as we close the chapter on this, we look forward to being back in BAU mode again, continuing to drive improvements and simplification and processes and the like, but now the focus is going to be really getting the full benefit from all the changes we've made in business and organization and moving forward.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 1, Justification: The CEO directly and extensively answered the question by detailing numerous concrete changes to how the bank is being run operationally, beyond just reporting structures. She provided specific examples of organizational restructuring, committee elimination, and process streamlining that demonstrate a fundamental shift in operations.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Mike Mayo (Analyst): Yeah, just a clarification. When you said medium term on this call as it relates to employee reductions, expense savings, revenue targets, and 11% to 12% Return on Average Tangible Common Equity, does medium term mean by 2026 or does it mean something different?\n",
      "Mark Mason (CFO): Yeah.\n",
      "Jane Fraser (CEO): 2026. By 2026. Thank you, Mike.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 1, Justification: The management directly and unequivocally answered the analyst's specific clarification question, confirming that 'medium term' refers to 'by 2026.' There was no vagueness, deflection, or avoidance of the question.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Vivek Juneja (Analyst): Okay. And then, Jane, to your point about the 20,000 head count cuts and I heard you just mentioned 5,000 from managerial positions, where are the rest 15,000 coming there?\n",
      "Jane Fraser (CEO): So let me just be clear about where the ones that we've just done and that we're working on through the organization simplification. So when I think about that effort, it will close at the end of the first quarter, as we said. We're expecting to get about $1 billion of run rate save from the org simplification work alone. That constitutes about 5,000 heads. We're just about to, at the end of this month, finish Phase 3, which will mean the first four layers of the organization have been addressed. That's been a net reduction of about 1,500 managers out of a total of 12,000 roles. There's about 13%, and these are mainly manager roles, as I talked about earlier.\n",
      "Then, when we think about where are other expense opportunities on top of this, as Mark was talking about earlier, the stranded costs, we'll be completing the elimination of the stranded costs from the divestitures. We'll be continuing, and you've seen us – been continuing that, exiting marginal businesses and hobbies and the like and being very disciplined about that.\n",
      "We've got some businesses where we feel we need to right size the core expense base. Andy Sieg is going to be kicking off that in Wealth, and you'll begin to see some of the impact of that in the first quarter. He's off to a strong start. And then, we've got others where we'll be creating more utilities. We've still got different fragmented activities across the firm that the organization simplification has highlighted. We'll be aggregating those, creating utilities, or are consolidating some of those different functions. And that is before we get to, beginning to get benefits from the transformation, where there'll be efficiencies that come through.\n",
      "We'll still have areas that we're investing. These are going to be, as we talked about, core business investments. It's going to be expense growth still in the top, from volume growth that we've got. And we will be investing in our transformation. And all of this is happening over the medium term to get us to the 11% to 12% Return on Average Tangible Common Equity target we talked about.\n",
      "So that 20,000, it's the number that we estimate of the headcount. I don't love thinking headcount. I like thinking about expenses. I think it's a more meaningful number. So as Mark laid out in his presentation, we've got a net expense save that we're expecting to achieve from the medium term. And these are the raft of different areas that will be contributing to it, and we're working hard at it.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 4, Justification: The answer avoids directly detailing the sources of the remaining 15,000 headcount cuts. While it extensively discusses the initial 5,000 cuts and various other general expense-saving initiatives, the CEO explicitly states a preference for focusing on expense savings over headcount numbers, thereby sidestepping a specific breakdown for the majority of the announced cuts.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Ryan Kenny (Analyst): Then, there's a lot of optimism and debate around capital markets rebound. Are you seeing that? And can you help update us on Investment Banking pipeline across Mergers & Acquisitions, Equity Capital Markets, Debt Capital Markets?\n",
      "Jane Fraser (CEO): Yes. We certainly had a much more constructive market environment to the end of 2023. Interest rate spreads and volatility at lows for the year. Equity prices are high. And I think we view this as a helpful foundation for activity to accelerate in 2024, assuming the tailwinds persist.\n",
      "And speaking of our own pipeline, the breadth, the depth, the quality of it's very sound. It's higher than it was pre-COVID. So when markets are constructive, we expect to move these opportunities forward. And we're hearing a lot more confidence from the CEOs, CFOs around this.\n",
      "And yeah, we're looking at our own side. As you know, we've been investing in some higher-growth areas, so we get a good balance between our traditionally strong sectors as well as high-growth areas. And we've been seeing some very good momentum in healthcare and technology, as well as areas of traditional strength, which is energy and industrial.\n",
      "And I think we feel very confident in the recovery in Debt Capital Markets. The beginnings of one in LevFin. And so, cautiously optimistic here. So I wouldn't say that it's going to accelerate enormously and with incredible speed, but I think we're feeling much better about the foundation. Mark, anything you'd add?\n",
      "Mark Mason (CFO): I completely agree.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 3, Justification: The CEO directly addresses the optimism around capital markets. However, while stating the overall pipeline is 'very sound' and specifically mentioning Debt Capital Markets, she does not provide a clear update or breakdown for the Mergers & Acquisitions or Equity Capital Markets pipelines as explicitly requested by the analyst, making the response somewhat vague for those key components.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Steven Chubak (Analyst): Hi, thanks for taking my questions. Really just some ticky-tack modeling questions on the revenue side. Does the revenue guidance for the full year include any reduction in credit card late fees? And how large of a contributor is that to revenues overall at Citigroup?\n",
      "Mark Mason (CFO): So, let's see, so obviously, the proposal is out there and we've factored in what's knowable as it relates to that. We haven't given guidance externally on what that impact is, but we do believe there are offsets and mitigants that, over time, we'll be able to kind of bring into play. And so, a long-winded way of saying our revenue forecast does assume some basic level of late fee adjustment.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 4, Justification: The CFO confirms that the revenue forecast includes \"some basic level of late fee adjustment\" but explicitly states they \"haven't given guidance externally on what that impact is.\" This directly avoids quantifying the expected reduction or the overall contribution of credit card late fees to revenue, thus sidestepping the core quantitative aspects of the question.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Erika Najarian (Analyst): Hi. I'm sorry to prolong the call. Thank you for all your color. Just one more question. Jane, when will you feel comfortable giving us a buyback outlook that's beyond just fourth quarter? I know you still have a little bit of ways to go, but you do have 100 basis point buffer to your minimum. And I know Basel III endgame is still out there, and I'm sure that reducing risk just doesn't mean expenses, but also reducing your – or being mindful of your Risk-Weighted Assets footprint. And given where your stock is relative to book, when will you be more comfortable about giving sort of a longer-term outlook that was underpinning your Return on Average Tangible Common Equity target with regards to the buyback?\n",
      "Jane Fraser (CEO): Erika, it's a great question. It's one I ask myself every morning when I get up, because given where we trade, the value for our shareholders of buybacks is enormous. And Mark and I are very committed to doing so. We also know that we're building our credibility. And I don't want to say things that we're not going to deliver against, although we're going to have to change. I think it's one of the values that we're really trying to adhere to very strongly.\n",
      "And with the NPR, I think we'll get a better sense about this soon. The comment period just got extended, and we want to see what that is. I think you've all heard us at the Senate banking hearings with our concerns about it.\n",
      "I very much hope that it is either completely revised or very materially, so it doesn't have a negative impact on the economy and the US banking system competitiveness, the move for more business to the shadow banks, which I think has got to a point, which is not healthy. So, we're going to wait and see where that comes out before we give it to you, but I would be asking exactly the same question in your shoes as well.\n",
      "Erika Najarian (Analyst): Thank you, Jane. I think that it was very helpful that you said on this public forum where you're trying to build credibility, because as I think about what long-only investors have been dying to see from Citi in terms of the previous leadership was that sort of awareness. And I think just having that awareness recognition will be very important to investors, so thank you.\n",
      "Jane Fraser (CEO): Thank you.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 2, Justification: The CEO directly addresses the question of when a longer-term buyback outlook will be provided by explicitly linking it to regulatory clarity on Basel III endgame (NPR). While no specific timeline is given due to external uncertainty, the reason for the lack of a current outlook is clearly articulated, making the answer mostly direct. There is minor vagueness as to an estimated timeline for the NPR resolution.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Steven Chubak (Analyst): Got it. And just on the earlier comments you made, Mark, around Services Net Interest Income. I am struggling to reconcile the 50/50 Net Interest Income contribution from rate and volume components, just given average loan to deposits were essentially flat year-on-year, Net Interest Income grew $3 billion. It does imply a much larger contribution from rates. I know there's deposit funds transfer pricing and other noise. So I was hoping maybe you could unpack that a little bit further.\n",
      "Mark Mason (CFO): I mean, there are a lot of factors in there. There's obviously, as well, the mix as it relates to what we have in the US versus outside of the US, so there are a number of factors there and probably too much to kind of take you through on the call here. But we're happy to kind of follow up with you offline and take you through it.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 4, Justification: The CFO avoids unpacking the NII contribution by stating there are \"too many factors\" to discuss on the call and offers an offline follow-up. This response provides no specific information to reconcile the figures, effectively deferring the detailed explanation and avoiding the analyst's direct question during the public call.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Ryan Kenny (Analyst): Hi. Thanks for taking my question. So, I have a question on quantitative tightening. Wondering if you have any early thoughts on how Citi's positioned if the Fed ends QT early? Is that a material catalyst for you, and would that help you hit your revenue targets even sooner?\n",
      "Mark Mason (CFO): Yeah. Again, I mean, when I think about our interest rate exposure, and for US dollar in particular, we showed it in our last Q, we'll show it in this Q. For a 100 basis point move in a parallel shift, we're looking at probably a negative $1.6 billion or so, but important to point out that the US dollar component of that is only a couple hundred million dollars. Similarly, if rates moved in the other way, positive of 100 basis points, there'd be a small movement as it relates to US dollar exposure. So our US dollar exposure is relatively neutral, again, assuming a static balance sheet, a parallel shift in the curve. And so, we're kind of neutral relative to rates moving in either direction and, therefore, the impact there.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 4, Justification: The CFO's response avoids directly addressing the specific question about Quantitative Tightening (QT) ending early. Instead, it redirects to a general discussion of the bank's interest rate exposure and neutrality to generic rate movements, without detailing the unique implications of QT ending early as a catalyst or its specific impact on revenue targets.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Ebrahim Poonawala (Analyst): Thank you. I guess just one question, Mark, around capital. So, you talked about $13 billion over the reg minimum. Like you could easily be doing 2x the buyback you did in one quarter, if not more. I know you don't like to talk about out-quarters, but give us a sense of the case this quarter. Should we expect the pace of buybacks to increase? And if you could provide additional color as we think about the rest of the year would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.\n",
      "Mark Mason (CFO): Sure. Look, you know and I've said it repeatedly, Jane has said it repeatedly, given where we trade, we think buying back is smart and we'd like to do as much as we possibly can and as much as makes sense in light of the uncertainty that's out there. We have run at about 13.5% this quarter. That does give us capacity above the 13.3%. But it's important to keep in mind that there's client demand that will continue to evolve. We want to make sure we can support the clients that want to do business with us, whether that be in Markets or other parts of the franchise.\n",
      "And then, there's still uncertainty out there about how the capital regulation evolves. The good news is we are hearing kind of favorable things about how the Basel III Endgame proposal could evolve, but that hasn't happened yet. It's not finalized. It's not in place yet. And so, we want to see how that continues to play out. We're obviously in the midst of a Comprehensive Capital Analysis process. We want to see how that evolves, and we'll continue to take the buyback decision on a quarter-by-quarter basis. But we recognize that there's an opportunity there, and we'll get after it just as soon as it makes good sense for us.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 4, Justification: The CFO acknowledges the capacity and desire to buy back shares but explicitly avoids committing to an increased pace or providing forward-looking guidance for the rest of the year. Instead, the response cites several external uncertainties and states that buyback decisions will be made on a \"quarter-by-quarter basis,\" effectively sidestepping the analyst's specific question about an increasing pace.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Matt O'Connor (Analyst): Hi. I want to follow up on the Russian exposure on page 34. It looks like you guys have taken a really good whack on the net investment. And you also highlighted how the Cumulative Translation Adjustment would be capital-neutral, even if you did have to write that down. But what about the remaining exposure? And just like how prime – are you responsible for some of these unremittable corporate derivatives? I think a lot of us don't understand that type of exposure. And is there risk to you going forward, or could you hopefully clear it back from the outside exposure going forward?\n",
      "Jane Fraser (CEO): Yeah, actually, I also want to kind of take a bigger picture answer to that before I turn it to Mark. Because I would have thought that's a question that is on everybody's minds, particularly given the firm's overall low level of returns and our headline numbers this quarter about what we've been doing with Russia and Argentina, the sort of bigger strategic question behind it, and then we'll get to your specifics on the Russia front.\n",
      "If you think about Citi, we have a differentiated global business model, and that means we're committed to the countries in which our multinational clients operate over the long run. So, that means we hold long-term capital in those countries, upon which we generate solid returns through the cycle. And let me just point to our leading Services and Foreign Exchange businesses are the heart of that network, and they're generating double-digits, as you can see.\n",
      "With that footprint comes a set of risks. So, I think of it in terms of credit, currency, transferability of capital. And we've proven our ability to manage those risks consistently over a long period of time. And with respect to the Q4 currency and transfer items, while the timing was unknown and we've highlighted those risks in our disclosures for a couple of years, I'd say, Russia is rather unique. It's a war, and for us, a highly unusual liquidation. We've navigated it very well. We've executed our wind-down in an orderly way with very low losses for our clients and very low losses for us. Our remaining net assets are now 100% reserved against.\n",
      "And I think similarly, if I just touch on Argentina for a minute, because I'm sure, folks have got a few questions on that. Similarly, over the last several years, we've de-risked our business model there. We don't have a consumer bank, so we've really reduced down our emerging markets exposures to just our institutional presence, focused on the multinational clients, you've heard us talk about that, and select high-grade local clients.\n",
      "If you look at Argentina, it's a very good business for us over the cycle. And even after the impacts of Q4, we had less than $5 million in credit losses in Argentina over a 10-year period. That's remarkable, $5 million over 10 years.\n",
      "In terms of the currency risk, we all have to book revenues, the official rate versus the parallel market rate. We are able to partially but not fully hedge the exposure, but we would certainly always take economic decisions on the business we do and did mindful of likely devaluations and capital controls.\n",
      "And the reserve is a reserve. It centers on the ability to convert and transfer capital as per US banking laws, so I just want to put part of things at this quarter into that context.\n",
      "We have a global business model. It's heavily focused on high-grade multinational clients. Our track record for managing the various risks associated with our global network has been very strong. And I think you're seeing us with a very conservative and reserved profile. Mark, what would you add?\n",
      "Mark Mason (CFO): Yeah, very quickly on the Russia point. As you know and as the slide points out, we've continued to bring our exposure down there. It's down to $6.5 billion, it's down 13% from the previous year and a third from 2021. We've brought down the consumer loans, the consumer deposits in a significant way there. And essentially, what's left is that we have a custody business and we're holding corporate dividends that are our clients' proceeds we’ re unable to pay those out by law, by regulation, and so we have to hold those and so that's what's being referenced in the slide when we say unremittable Russia corporate dividends. And so, that is not a risk of loss for us, but we're unable to kind of clear those because of the state of play in Russia at this stage.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 2, Justification: Jane Fraser initially provides a broad, strategic overview that largely avoids the specific questions about remaining Russian exposure and unremittable derivatives. However, Mark Mason then directly addresses these points, providing the specific remaining exposure amount, clarifying the nature and risk of the unremittable corporate dividends, and stating they are not a risk of loss. While the initial response from one executive was somewhat evasive, the other executive fully clarified the key details, making the overall answer mostly direct.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Betsy Graseck (Analyst): I guess a couple of questions. Well, so I know we talked through the Institutional Securities business already on moving that expense ratio a little bit. Could we dig in a little bit on the Wealth side, because the expense ratio there is running a little higher, and so, it'd be useful just to understand the pace or speed or timeframe when we should expect to see that start to inflect.\n",
      "Jane Fraser (CEO): Yes, absolutely. And some of it, just as a reminder, the actions that we've been taking on org simplification and that Andy has also been taking in the Wealth business. We will work through notice periods in the coming weeks. And so, you'll start – you'll see the impact coming through in our head count numbers, and in Wealth, in the expense base next quarter. Look, as Mark said in his opening and Andy has been talking about, this should be a – sort of up to a 30% pre-tax margin business.\n",
      "Andy is focused on rationalizing the expense base. He's also, as Mark said, turning on the growth engine. He's enhancing our platforms and capabilities to elevate the client experience. The heart of the opportunity for us lies with our existing clients. They are an extraordinary client base, but they're underpenetrated. So, a lot of the operating efficiency is frankly going to be – is going to come on the revenue side here. That said, Andy's taken a number of pretty decisive moves this quarter on the expense side.\n",
      "Mark, let me toss it over to you.\n",
      "Mark Mason (CFO): Yes. I mean, look, I think that the quarter expenses that you see of growth of 3% is not yet reflective of the work that Andy has been steadfast at. There is still some investment in there in technology and in the platform that's important. But I think coming out of the first quarter, you'll start to see some of the reduction in expenses that's a by-product of that work. And the work has been across the entire expense base in the Wealth business. So, that includes non-client-facing roles and support staff. It includes looking at the productivity of existing bankers and advisors, and those kind of reductions will start to play out in the subsequent quarters.\n",
      "I do want to point out, as Jane mentioned, this is a growth business for us. And so, you can see on some of the metrics on page 15 in the bottom left, some of those good signs of investment momentum. And I highlight that because as the expenses come down from some of those efficiencies, there will be a need for us to continue to invest and replenish low-performing or low-producing bankers and advisors with resources that actually can generate the revenues we expect and take advantage of the client opportunity that's in front of us.\n",
      "So, long-winded way of saying there's some operating efficiency upside for us for sure. It's a combination of the top line and the expense work playing through the balance of the quarters and the year here.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 2, Justification: The executives directly state that the impact on the Wealth business's expense base will be seen \"next quarter\" or \"coming out of the first quarter,\" directly addressing the timeframe aspect of the question. While they do not provide a specific numerical pace for the inflection, they detail the types of actions being taken and explain that efficiency gains will also come from revenue growth, offering a mostly direct response with minor vagueness on precise quantitative speed.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Jim Mitchell (Analyst): Okay. Good morning. Jane and Mark, I very much appreciate the comments on your growth opportunities and driving growth. But revenues are often dictated by the macro that is a little bit out of your control. So, can you talk a little bit about the flexibility on the expenses? You have a range in 2026 of $51 billion to $53 billion. So, if revenues are coming in below the targets, is it, I guess, A, fair to assume you'd be at the very low-end of that range or is – and I think there is some revenue growth built in there. So, is there some flexibility to the downside to try to get to your targets in a tougher revenue environment? Thanks.\n",
      "Mark Mason (CFO): Yeah. Look, the top line growth, as you've heard us say, is a Compound Annual Growth Rate of 4% to 5%. We've put that target out there of $51 billion to $53 billion as a range of what we're working towards. We've given you a good sense of how we expect to get there with the $2 billion to $2.5 billion reduction by then. We've already signaled $1.5 billion that's in front of us.\n",
      "The reality is that if there's softness in revenues, that's why we have a range, obviously, the volume-related expenses would come down with any softness in revenue. And depending on the drivers of why that revenue is softening, we'd look at the investments that we're making across the business and make sure that those are appropriately calibrated for where we are in the cycle and what we're seeing on the top line.\n",
      "With that said, we've got to continue to invest in the Transformation. We're not going to compromise that. That's going to be something that we have to spend on to ensure we continue to get right. But that's kind of how the dynamic works. There's a top – we've got a mix of businesses that I think we've demonstrated resiliency around if you think about the past couple of years, and we expect for those to continue to drive some top line momentum. But we've got levers in case they don't.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 3, Justification: The CFO's answer partially addresses the question by confirming that volume-related expenses would decrease and investments would be calibrated in a softer revenue environment, suggesting movement towards the lower end of the expense range. However, it avoids directly stating whether there is flexibility to go *below* the stated $51 billion to $53 billion range, which was a key part of the analyst's inquiry about downside flexibility. The commitment to Transformation investments also implicitly limits the extent of this flexibility.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Ken Usdin (Analyst): Okay. And a separate question on Treasury and Trade Solutions. That Net Interest Income related to Treasury and Trade Solutions has been remarkable with rising rates. This quarter, granted there was a lesser day and there could be currency stuff in there, the first quarter that it stepped back, I'm just wondering like where is that in its asset liability sensitivity, the Treasury and Trade Solutions Net Interest Income, and what are your thoughts about that piece of the Net Interest Income puzzle going forward? Thanks.\n",
      "Mark Mason (CFO): Sure, yeah. I mean, I think I'd say a couple things. We do have kind of some Argentina playing through the Net Interest Income line. I will say that the best way to think about it is kind of the underlying beta activity. And we have seen, this is the corporate client, it is an institutional client. We have seen betas, particularly in the US, at kind of normalized or terminal levels and playing a bit through that. We are seeing betas outside of the US continue to increase as it relates to the Treasury and Trade Solutions client base.\n",
      "But all of that again is inside of the range that we've talked about. I don't expect to see kind of year-over-year growth on the Net Interest Income line anywhere close to kind of what we've seen in prior years, prior quarters, just in light of kind of how the rate environment’ s evolved, and in light of kind of quantitative tightening and the impact on deposit levels. The last point I'd make on this is, we will continue to drive and see growth as it relates to the operating deposits, and that will be an important tailwind that kind of plays through.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 2, Justification: The CFO directly addresses the forward outlook for NII, explaining why past growth rates are not sustainable and highlighting operating deposit growth as a tailwind. He also touches upon asset-liability sensitivity by discussing deposit betas in different regions. While not a fully exhaustive breakdown of A/L sensitivity, the response provides relevant information and addresses the core inquiries without significant evasion.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Ken Usdin (Analyst): Great. Thanks. Can I follow up on the card line of thinking and just ask you, Mark, to talk a little bit about just cost of credit? We did still see some card related build this quarter even with the comments you just made and seasonal softer loan growth So, just from a bigger picture perspective, how do you think, continue to think about reserve builds from here and how that informs your outlook for cost of credit?\n",
      "Mark Mason (CFO): Yeah, sure. Look, I think that when I think about the reserve builds, I think it's the same factors that come into play. So, obviously, the view on the macro is important. And right now, if you think about some of the key macro factors that impact the cards portfolio, the unemployment assumptions weighted is about 5%, the downside is about 7% kind of weighted over the period. And so, how that evolves will be an important factor. How HPI evolves would be an important consideration here for this portfolio, but also what happens with volumes becomes a factor on reserve builds and how important or how much they increase or decrease.\n",
      "And then the final piece is mix, and it's kind of related to that revolver point. As we see the mix evolve from transactors to revolvers, that's going to play into how much of a reserve from a lifetime point of view we have to continue to build. And so, it's why I mentioned on John's question the importance of looking at the interest rates, looking at what's happening with inflation, watching the lower income customer base, because all of those things combined with how we think about the scenarios and the weighting will be a factor on the reserves.\n",
      "But I will say, Ken, as I sit here and think about what we have in the quarter, I feel very good about the reserve levels. The 8.2% for combined kind of Allowance for Credit Losses-to-loan ratio feels right for the mix of this portfolio and we'll continue to watch it.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 4, Justification: The CFO explains the factors that influence reserve builds (macro, volumes, mix) and expresses confidence in current reserve levels, but avoids providing a clear outlook on future reserve builds or the cost of credit \"from here.\" The answer details the inputs to their thinking without committing to an expectation regarding future builds, which was the core of the analyst's forward-looking question.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "John McDonald (Analyst): Okay and on the Branded side, you still expect kind of the peak-ish? Are you still inside of the range for the full year and expect 2025, you could move lower on the Branded charge-offs?\n",
      "Mark Mason (CFO): Yes, I still kind of expect that trend line of peaking and then kind of moving a bit lower in Branded.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 3, Justification: The CFO directly confirmed the expected trend of peaking and then moving lower in Branded charge-offs. However, the answer completely omitted addressing whether the current expectations remain within the previously guided full-year range, which was a specific part of the analyst's question. This makes the response only partially address the overall query.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Chris Kotowski (Analyst): Good afternoon, thanks. Just a quick one for Mark. Previously, you had talked about \"bending the cost curve\" between the third and the fourth quarter of this year, and on this call I thought I heard you say it's basically bent, that second quarter should be down and we should be sequentially lower from here, so did it just happen six months earlier or is there still some other bending that comes late this year?\n",
      "Mark Mason (CFO): I'll take it. I'll take that.\n",
      "Jane Fraser (CEO): I wanted that one.\n",
      "Mark Mason (CFO): No. I mean I'll take the win. A downward trajectory from here through the end of the year, in-line with the guidance of $53.5 billion to $53.8 billion and so yes.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 1, Justification: The CFO directly confirms a \"downward trajectory\" for costs through the end of the year, aligning with the previously stated full-year guidance. This clearly addresses the analyst's question about whether the cost bending happened earlier or if it's an ongoing process, indicating the latter while reinforcing the overall guidance.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "ERIKA NAJARIAN (Analyst): Hi. I had two questions and I'll ask the first one on expenses first since it's a good follow-up to the previous. Mark, just to clarify. Let's just say, take the highest end of your range at $53.8 billion. Just trying to think about how consensus will move. So, we take that $53.8 billion and then add the $285 million of Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation expenses year-to-date so far and add the civil money penalties of $136 million, so that gets us to $54.2 billion for the year and any other repositioning charges in the second half of the year would already be included in the $53.8 billion?\n",
      "MARK MASON (CFO): So, yes. The answer to the last part of your question is yes. So in the range that I've given, $53.5 billion to $53.8 billion, that includes our estimate for the full year of repositioning and any restructuring charges. That range excludes the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Special Assessment that we saw earlier in the year and it excludes the CMP of $136 million.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 1, Justification: The CFO directly addresses all parts of the analyst's question. He explicitly states what is included and excluded from the expense range, providing a clear and specific clarification.\n",

      "Mike Mayo (Analyst): Hi. A follow-up, Mark, you said Treasury and Trade Solutions, you said we will have growth in operational deposits, and I was just wondering what gives you such confidence that you will, or is that accelerating or the same pace or what?\n",
      "Mark Mason (CFO): We have seen growth in the quarter, in operating deposits. The confidence comes from the focus that we've had with our existing clients as well as the growth we've seen with new clients, doing more with existing in more countries, more deeply penetrating the commercial middle-market space, and so we've been very thoughtfully focused on deposits that obviously give us the most value and also, provide the most stickiness as it relates to that relationship and so yes, the confidence is rooted in what we're seeing in the way of underlying operating deposit growth including inside this quarter.\n",
      "Jane Fraser (CEO): It's also a lot of the investments that we've been making, fuel a lot of the growth we've got. We have a market- leading product innovations and those continue to drive good returns, good growth. If it's Citi Token Services, Citi Payment Express, 24/7 Clearing, all of these different elements really mean that this business is utterly invaluable and indispensable to our clients and the stickiness of the deposits, the operating deposits comes with that, so we feel good about that growth. And you'll hear more about this as well, Mike, in the Investor Day in mid-June which will be I think we hope will be very helpful to everyone so you really get your arms around how this business operates, makes money, and see why we call it a crown jewel.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 2, Justification: Management confirms ongoing growth in operational deposits and provides detailed reasons for their confidence, including client focus and product innovation. However, they do not explicitly address the analyst's specific query about whether the growth is \"accelerating or the same pace,\" which was part of the original question.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Betsy Graseck (Analyst): Oh, hi, thanks so much. I just wanted to make sure of one thing on the expenses. I know in the past you've talked about the fact that 1Q will be a little elevated with the restructuring. And you showed that was the $225 million in the quarter, and then when we look to 2Q, we should – should we still be expecting a step-down in 2Q? And is that step-down just the elimination of the $225 million or is there some restructuring that we're likely to see in 2Q as well? In other words, should I just fade sequentially 2Q, 3Q, 4Q to hit your annual number or is there a bigger step-down in 2Q that I should still be expecting here? Thanks.\n",
      "Mark Mason (CFO): Sure. I think you should just fade it, to answer your question very directly, but I'd also point out that in Q1, if you really look through to it, it has the $250 million of Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation charge in it, and so when you back that out, we effectively are coming in lower than what we had guided right. Despite that I'm telling you the same – I'm making the same point, which is you can expect a downward trend from here through to the end of the year and while there won't be additional restructuring charge, there will be the normal BAU activity around repositioning that plays through, so hopefully that answers your question, Betsy. The guidance still holds, and the downward trend is what we are managing towards, as we kind of play out the balance of the year.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 1, Justification: The CFO directly addresses all components of the analyst's question. He explicitly confirms that the expenses should be faded sequentially and clarifies that there will be no additional restructuring charges, only normal business-as-usual repositioning. The response provides clear guidance for the expense trajectory.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Vivek Juneja (Analyst): Hi. Thank you. Jane, Mark, just a question maybe on Argentina, you've shown $100 million in Net Interest Income. Total net income benefit of $500 million after-tax, so probably implying about $500 million, $600 million of non-interest income benefit. Which line item – sorry, which segment did that come through, and is that sustainable?\n",
      "Mark Mason (CFO): Yeah, look, there's a mix obviously of things that are driving that net income, including a tax impact on the heels of last year Argentina devaluation activity that's in that line. But the short answer is that if you think about the nature of the business that we do in Argentina, it is a big part of our institutional client relationships. And the primary activities include some of the Treasury and Trade Solutions-type of activities that we've talked about, so liquidity management, payments, custody within the Services business. And so, you'd see a good portion of the activity in Argentina playing through the Services business, some of it in Markets as well, but again, the majority of the activity in Services.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 4, Justification: The CFO directly answered the first part of the question by specifying the segments and activities contributing to the net income. However, the crucial second part of the question regarding the sustainability of this income was completely avoided, with no explanation or forward-looking statement provided.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Vivek Juneja (Analyst): Hi. Mark, completely different topic, because I think I understood your answer to be just – from my previous question to be the tax benefits so we'll leave it at that. If it's different then I need to go down that path, but the question I signed on to ask was, you talked about the percentage of revolvers increasing from transactors in the private-label and the retail partner cards. What is that percentage and how does it compare with what it was pre-pandemic?\n",
      "Mark Mason (CFO): Yeah, I don't – we haven't broken down the transactor versus revolver mix, and so I'm not going to get into that. I will say that the revolver levels are at least back to where they were pre-pandemic and leave it at that, but we are seeing kind of continued revolver activity which you'd expect kind of given the way the cycle has evolved and given payment rates have started to moderate and the stimulus has kind of unwound, and so all of that is kind of consistent with expectations but obviously, is a factor in reserve levels as I mentioned earlier.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 2, Justification: The CFO directly stated they do not break down the specific percentage requested, which is a clear refusal rather than an evasion. However, he did provide a direct answer to the second part of the question, confirming that revolver levels are at least back to pre-pandemic levels. This combination makes the answer mostly direct, with a clear limitation.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Matt O'Connor (Analyst): Hi. In your prepared remarks, you talked about intensifying certain efforts regarding regulatory processes and data on slide 4 here and was just wondering if you could elaborate on I guess what you're doing or trying to do differently on that front and if there's any meaningful financial impact. Thank you.\n",
      "Jane Fraser (CEO): Yeah, look. I think, Matt, as we've talked about many times, the Transformation is our top priority, it will be for the next few years. It is foundational for our future success, both in terms of delivering the strategy and the medium-term financial path and we've been making significant investments behind it, as well as not only on the consent order, but also making sure we've got this modern efficient infrastructure.\n",
      "And we're currently deep into a very large body of work, upgrading our data architecture, automating manual controls and processes, consolidating fragmented tech platforms, and all of these help enhance our business performance more broadly, not just the risk and control in the medium term.\n",
      "And as I've said though, there are a few areas where we are intensifying our efforts, such as the automation of certain regulatory processes and data remediation, particularly related to regulatory reporting. We're committed to getting these right. The org changes will help us with execution and making sure that we have the impetus and everything that we need behind it, the investments that we need. We keep a close eye on execution, making sure we've got the right level of resourcing and expertise and we'll invest what we need to do to make sure that we address these different concerns.\n",
      "I can't go into much more detail in terms of CSI obviously, but something of this magnitude you'd expect us to have some areas where we have good progress and others where we need to intensify efforts.\n",
      "Mark Mason (CFO): Yeah, I mean I think that's exactly right, but you'd also expect that in this type of environment, and on the heels of the regional bank stress last year that we're looking at stress scenarios, we're enhancing our Comprehensive Capital Analysis processes, we're enhancing our resolution to recovery processes. All of those things just to kind of make sure that we're shoring up capabilities and you'd expect that across the industry quite frankly.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 4, Justification: The management provides general categories of ongoing work and mentions intensifying efforts in certain areas but avoids specifying what exactly they are doing differently. The CEO explicitly states an inability to go into more detail, and the CFO redirects to general industry expectations, completely avoiding the financial impact question beyond a commitment to invest as needed.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Glenn Schorr (Analyst): Thanks very much. So I think it shows how much you've helped us see the simpler organization. I think people have totally bought into the expense story, so a lot of credit to you guys. I think where I, personally, and others still have questions on is on the revenue side and getting to those 4% to 5% medium-term targets.\n",
      "So, could you take us just conceptually where we're going to – where you think you'll drive that growth from, from this baseline where we're at now? And if you want, you can totally use my second question in there and tell us what good things you're doing inside the Investment Banking line.\n",
      "Jane Fraser (CEO): You snuck that one in, Glenn. So I'll kick off with some of this, pass it to Mark and then I'll come back to Banking. So look, we are laser-focused on the growth and improving the returns of these businesses to where they should and will be in the medium term, and it's not just the growth story, but let me anchor it in those medium-term return targets.\n",
      "In Services, we want to continue around the mid-20s in Return on Average Tangible Common Equity. Banking should be getting to around 15%. Markets 10% to 13%, so we'd like to see it at the higher end of that range. U.S. Personal Banking getting that back to the mid-teens and then moving on to the high-teens in the medium term. And then lastly, as Andy and Mark have talked about, getting Wealth to a 15% to 20% return in the medium term, but the goal is to the mid-20s in the longer-term here.\n",
      "And we're confident that our strategy is going to drive the revenue growth of 4% to 5% Compound Annual Growth Rate in the medium term and that's a combination of maintaining our leadership in certain businesses, gaining share in others. We have good client growth. Look at our win rate, for example, in Treasury and Trade Solutions at over 80%. We've got our Commercial Bank also bringing in new clients in the mid-market and helping them accelerate their growth and success around the world.\n",
      "But, Mark, let me pass it over to you.\n",
      "Mark Mason (CFO): Sure. And good morning, Glenn, and we appreciate the acknowledgment around the expenses. As you know, we've been quite focused on that and working hard to ensure that we deliver on what we say we're going to do there.\n",
      "I'd point – on the revenue line, I'd first point to, if you look back, since Investor Day, we've in fact been able to deliver on the guidance that we've given for the medium term, so that 4% to 5% top line growth. And, yes, it was a different rate environment, but that growth that we delivered over the past couple of years has been a mix of both revenue and underlying business strength.\n",
      "As you think about the guidance we talked about for this year, we talked about the Net Interest Income ex-Markets being down modestly. And so what that means is that the momentum and the growth that we expect is going to come from the non-interest revenue. And I think this quarter is a good example of where and how that's likely to play through, so the revenue top line being up 3-plus percent, but when you look through each of the businesses, and if you look on each of the pages where we disclose the revenue, you can see the underlying Non-interest Revenue growth in the bottom left hand corner of each of those pages, that's coming through as well. So Services up 14% with growth in both Treasury and Trade Solutions, between cross-border, clearing, commercial cards, but also – and Securities Services, right, with the growth that we're seeing from continued momentum in assets under custody. We expect that trend to continue with existing clients and new clients as well as how we do more with our commercial market – commercial middle market business, excuse me. So Non-interest Revenue growth there.\n",
      "The Investment Banking piece is the other driver of fees. We're seeing that wallet start to rebound. We're part of that rebound. The announced transactions, we're part of those in sectors that we've been investing in. We're bringing in new talent to help us realize and experience that.\n",
      "And even in Wealth, where we're not pleased with the top line performance this quarter of down 4%. When you look through that, we do have good underlying NIR1 growth in the quarter in Wealth and that's up 11% year-over-year and it's in the area that Andy and the team is leaning in on which is investments and not just in one region, but across all the regions.\n",
      "And then finally, the U.S. Personal Banking piece which is showing good NIR1 growth as well, so the long and short of it is that the 4% growth that's implied in $80 billion to $81 billion is going to be continued momentum, largely in fees, helping us to deliver for our clients and make continued progress towards that medium-term target.\n",
      "Jane Fraser (CEO): So let me pick up, I'm sure Jenn Landis will give us the evil eye for sneaking in a second question there, Glenn, but let me pick up on Banking and what's going on there. So we have a very clear strategy that we've been executing over the last couple of years, really to lay the foundation for growth in Banking.\n",
      "North America is our key priority. It's the biggest contributor to the global Investment Banking Return on Average Tangible Common Equity: Return on Average Tangible wallet. Tech, healthcare and industrials are likely to constitute over 50% of the fee wallet going forward. So we have better aligned our resources to position the franchise for this. Defending areas of traditional strength in industrials and the like, energy, whilst investing in high-growth sectors such as healthcare and technology with some strong talent.\n",
      "Financial sponsors are sitting on $3 trillion of estimated fire power, which they are incentivized to deploy, so they're likely to be between 20% to 30% of global Investment Banking fees. We've great relationships with this community, we've built that over years and decades. You're going to see us more active in the LevFin space, in the right situations for our key clients, and we'll continue to ensure we're well-positioned and active around this important opportunity.\n",
      "You'll likely see us seeking to remain competitive in the private capital asset class. That's going to be an important source of liquidity for many clients and the middle market will be fertile hunting ground for corporates and private equity and our Investment Bank and Commercial Bank are going to be closely coordinated to harvest the deal flow around the world.\n",
      "And indeed, the new org structure that I was just talking about really enables us to drive a more joined-up, client-centric, strategic coverage across Corporate, Commercial and Investment Banking. So over and above the wallet recovery, Mark and I are going to be very laser-focused on ensuring that we're driving revenue growth from a more holistic focus on the wallet share across flow and episodic activity.\n",
      "Vis Raghavan is the right person to take over at this important moment for our Banking franchise, the momentum that we've been generating with the foundations we've been laying. Now, the intention here from him is to accelerate that. He will focus on increasing our performance intensity, driving productivity and disciplined growth, and he will keep us firmly on the path towards delivering on our commitments, fundamentally improving the operating margin, generating high returns and that all-important fee revenue.\n",
      "Betsy Graseck (Analyst): Hi. Good morning – or yes, we're almost pinging into the afternoon here.\n",
      "Jane Fraser (CEO): Hi, Betsy.\n",
      "Mark Mason (CFO): Great to hear you, Betsy.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 2, Justification: The management provides a mostly direct and detailed response. While the CEO initially discusses return targets before pivoting to revenue growth, both the CEO and CFO then provide specific conceptual drivers and examples, such as the focus on non-interest revenue and growth in various business segments like Services, Investment Banking, Wealth, and U.S. Personal Banking. The second part of the question regarding Investment Banking strategy is addressed comprehensively with clear strategic initiatives and focus areas.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "JIM MITCHELL (Analyst): Hey. Good morning. Just, Mark, maybe on Net Interest Income, down almost 4% year-over-year. Seems a little bit more than the guidance was down modestly for the year. So, can you discuss sort of the puts and takes this quarter and how we should think about the quarterly trajectory for the rest of the year?\n",
      "MARK MASON (CFO): Yeah. So, I'd say a couple things. So, one, as I mentioned, in the quarter and you see it on slide 9, ex-Markets, we're down about 3%. That's largely driven by some Foreign Exchange translation that played through, but also some seasonally lower revolving card balances and then lower interest rates in Argentina. And what that is in Argentina, we have capital there, the policy rate was adjusted downward and as that happened, we obviously earned less on that capital that flows through the Net Interest Income line.\n",
      "As I think about the back half of the year and the guidance we have of modestly down, there are a couple of puts and takes to keep in mind. So, one is going to be rates, right, so as I think about the higher yield that we can earn on reinvestment, that'll be a tailwind that plays through from an Net Interest Income point of view.\n",
      "The second would be volume growth, particularly in our card loans portfolio and we do expect to see continued volume growth across certainly the Branded portfolio and so that'll be another tailwind for us on the Net Interest Income line.\n",
      "In terms of the headwinds, you've got the lower Net Interest Income earned in Argentina from rates, that'll continue to play through. We've got assumed higher average betas in 2024, specifically on the non-US side. We still have in our forecast the impact of CFPB late fees, so assuming that that goes into effect for this year, that will have an impact and it's in the forecast, and then the impact of lost Net Interest Income from the exits that we have. And so, the combination of those things will probably mean that Net Interest Income in the back half of the year is a little bit higher than the first half, but again, consistent with the guidance that we gave of modestly down.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 1, Justification: The CFO provides a very direct and detailed response. They explain the specific factors contributing to the Net Interest Income decline in the current quarter and then thoroughly outline both the tailwinds and headwinds expected to impact the quarterly trajectory for the rest of the year, clearly linking it back to the original guidance.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "John McDonald (Analyst): Thanks. Mark, I was hoping you'd give a little more color on how you're feeling about the credit card charge-offs. You maintained the outlook for the year. You mentioned the higher end on Retail Services. Do you still feel like you'll see a peak this year? And what kind of metrics are you looking at in terms of delinquency formation and seasoning to inform that view that you might see the peak in card charge-offs this year?\n",
      "Mark Mason (CFO): Yeah. Thanks, John. We have obviously continued to manage this portfolio very actively. We've seen continued top line growth. We've seen continued average interest-earning balance growth. We've talked about how we expect for the cost of credit to normalize, and we've seen that continue to happen. The range that we've given on Branded Cards, we're inside of that range. When you look at the spend across the portfolios, the spend is really happening with the affluent customers more so than anything else. And so, we're watching the lower income customer profile – or customers that we have. But again, as Jane mentioned, we tend to skew to the higher end to begin with.\n",
      "Where we're really seeing the pressure is where I mentioned in terms of Retail Services. And so, there, the current Net Credit Losses are higher than the high-end of the full year range that I've given. But if you look back, that is not inconsistent with seasonality that we've seen in the past in that portfolio, where the first two quarters are higher than the back half of the year, in part because of coming out of the holiday season and how losses tend to mature or materialize through that process.\n",
      "And so, I'd expect to not only see them be higher than the average range in Q1, but also in Q2 before coming down. And then, I still expect that in 2025, you tend to see them further normalize and come down a bit off of these ranges. But look, the reality is that we continue to watch it, and the factors that are out there that are important include how unemployment evolves, what happens with inflation, what happens with interest rates, and those will be important factors as to how the loss rates continue to evolve over time.\n",
      "I think the final point I'd make and I mentioned it in the prepared remarks is that we have to remember that the loss rates in both portfolios reflect kind of multiple vintages maturing at the same time. And you'll recall, and this is an industry dynamic, through the COVID pandemic period, losses were at an all-time low, payment rates at all-time highs, supported by government stimulus.\n",
      "And now coming out of that, we're seeing the COVID vintages mature, albeit at a lagged pace from what would be normal, and we're seeing the incremental acquisitions that we've done start to mature at their normal pace. And so, these loss rates are exacerbated by that impact and that's an important factor we can't lose sight of. But the bottom line is that we're watching it. The macro factors matter. We feel good about the quality mix that we have, and we'll kind of see how things evolve from here.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 4, Justification: The CFO indirectly addresses the \"peak this year\" question by stating expectations for normalization in 2025, rather than affirming a 2024 peak. Crucially, the response avoids providing the specific internal metrics (delinquency formation and seasoning) requested by the analyst, instead offering only general macro-economic factors like unemployment and inflation.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Scott Siefers (Analyst): Hey, everyone. Thanks for taking the question. Mark, I think you touched on at least a component of this a couple questions ago, but maybe just broadly an update on your rate positioning. I guess I only ask, because it looks like we might be starting to diverge in terms of global rate trajectories, if we potentially go lower in Europe, but higher here for a while. In the aggregate, do these kind of complicate your management or make you feel better or worse about the overall Net Interest Income momentum for the company?\n",
      "Mark Mason (CFO): Yeah, let me try and take it in, in two pieces, I guess. So one is, if I think about how the rate implieds have evolved from the 3 to 6 to now something a little bit north of 1 in the context of what I expect for our performance, it doesn't have a material impact on the guidance that I've given of $80 billion to $81 billion.\n",
      "And in part, that's because as I think about the timing for the planned cuts, which was generally back-loaded, as well as some of the other factors that play through. So, you know, Argentina just announced a policy rate reduction yesterday or a couple of days ago. If rates are a bit higher for longer, we'll watch how the betas continue to evolve. I mentioned earlier, the late fees for the cards business happened a bit sooner. Late fees are actually booked in our Net Interest Income line. And so, those factors put me in a place where I feel like there will certainly be puts and takes around how that rate curve evolves, and therefore I'm very comfortable kind of leaving the guidance where it is.\n",
      "To answer your broader question, in terms of kind of how we are positioned, I'd point you to the 10-K that we have that's out. And in that 10-K, we offer as we have before a number of IRE scenarios for plus or minus 100 basis points and what it means for our business. And if you look at it, you'll see that for the aggregate firm, for Citi, US dollar and non-US dollar, that we're asset-sensitive. So, as rates increase, we should see an increase in our Net Interest Income performance.\n",
      "But if you look at the breakdown and that's about – I think it was about $1.4 billion or something in terms of the impact of that move. But if you look at the breakdown, what the breakdown will show is that for US dollar, at this point we're neutral. So, if rates were to go up, rates were to go down, no material impact as it relates to our revenue.\n",
      "For the non-US dollar, we're still quite asset-sensitive, right? And so, that should give you some sense for – and we recognize the limitations with IRE, it assumes 100 basis point parallel shift across the curve to a static balance sheet, etcetera, but that should give you some sense for the implications of the rate curve moves as it relates to our book of business.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 1, Justification: The CFO directly addresses both aspects of the question. He explicitly states that the evolving rate environment does not materially impact NII guidance and then clearly breaks down the firm's rate positioning by currency (neutral for USD, asset-sensitive for non-USD), which directly answers the concern about diverging global rate trajectories. The answer is clear, specific, and provides relevant details.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "GLENN SCHORR (Analyst): Hi. Thank you. So, Mark, I heard your comments on credit this year. I'm talking the US Personal Banking. I heard your comments for credit the rest of this year and I think in a position that you're very conservatively reserved. But right now, you put up a 3% margin and credit costs are almost half of what revenues are in this space. I guess, my question is this: As we roll forward, in a slowing economy with likely a little bit lower – some rate cuts, how does the P&L evolve? How does it improve from here? Because can we be expecting credit costs to come in, in a slowing economy? I'm just trying to figure out the path forward because it could be impactful if U.S. Personal Banking obviously marches to where you need it to be.\n",
      "MARK MASON (CFO): Yeah, look, like I said, we do think that there is certainly upside to U.S. Personal Banking. We're looking for that upside in the medium-term targets that we've set for ourselves. You've got to remember that when you look at the quarter and you look at the half, frankly, that we're still in a period where we're seeing the normalization of the cost of credit. And as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, you have kind of a compounding effect of multiple vintages now maturing at the same time that's playing through the P&L. That's not just true for us, that's true for others as well. And so we'd expect and we are – we do believe we're seeing some signs of a cresting when you look at delinquencies now and so we would expect that those losses start to normalize and loss rates start to come down as we go towards the medium term.\n",
      "At the same time, we're investing in the business and we're looking to see continued growth in volume and on the top line. And the combination of those things, as we drive towards the medium term, will help us to deliver both the top line growth and certainly improve returns from where we sit today and in line with what we've guided to.\n",
      "So, it's a combination of top line performance from volume and obviously the environment plays into that, but we feel like we've got a reasonable assumption around top line growth there, cost of credit normalizing, continued discipline on the expense line, allowing for us to get improved returns across that U.S. Personal Banking business.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 2, Justification: The CFO directly addresses the core concerns, explaining that credit costs are expected to normalize and decrease in the medium term due to cresting delinquencies. He also outlines the path to P&L improvement through a combination of volume growth, normalizing credit costs, and expense discipline. While specific numerical projections or exact timelines are not provided, the answer clearly explains the anticipated evolution and drivers, making it mostly direct.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Saul Martinez (Analyst): Hi. Good afternoon. I'll change tacks a little bit here, but I'm curious if there's any update on the Mexican IPO and more specifically, I'm kind of curious how set in stone the IPO process is. You will have a new administration and even if it's a candidate from the same party, she may have a less confrontational view of the private sector, perhaps be more allowing of a local bank to extract value from buying a bank. I guess if the facts on the ground were to change, would you be open to a sale potentially being back on the table, because it does seem like this is a situation where a private market valuation could be higher and even materially higher than the public market valuation.\n",
      "Jane Fraser (CEO): The guiding principle that we have and we've had all along is making sure that we make a decision here that is in the best interest of our shareholders and makes the most sense for them. We are – we never say never, but we are very focused on the IPO path here. We believe it is the right one for our shareholders. We're well on track in the path in Mexico. We're very pleased to bring Ignacio Deschamps in as the Banamex Chairman to help guide the IPO process. We announced the management teams for the two banks earlier this quarter. We're far down the path of the technological separation of both banks, and then the full legal separation in the second half of the year.\n",
      "Obviously, the election Is coming up fairly shortly, but we're not anticipating that we would be deviating from the IPO path. That is the path that we are on at the moment. I'll never say never but we do believe that this is the right one, but we'll keep an eye on what's happening in Mexico as we always do.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 2, Justification: The CEO directly addresses the IPO update and clarifies their strategic commitment to the IPO path, even considering a new administration. While she uses the phrase \"never say never\" regarding a potential sale, she immediately reaffirms their strong focus on the IPO, making the answer mostly direct with only minor vagueness about hypothetical future changes.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Gerard Cassidy (Analyst): Hi, Mark. Hi, Jane. Mark, can you share with us, there's been obviously a lot of conversation around the credit card charge-offs and the credit quality there. If we could shift over to the corporate side, which obviously is very strong, we have seen spreads narrow in the markets on high-yield corporate debt, leverage debt, etcetera. It's very robust out there, but around the global geopolitical risk, do you think the spreads would be widening? Can you guys share with us what you're seeing on the corporate side in terms of competition? Are underwriting standards getting a little bit weaker now as people are trying to grow their books, what are you seeing on that front?\n",
      "Mark Mason (CFO): So, look, we're still seeing good demand for corporate credit. And what I'd say is that we've been very disciplined about where we want to play on the risk profile here. We've been very disciplined in terms of the investment-grade large multinationals that we serve. And that hasn't shifted from an underwriting point of view. We have seen spaces like private credit pick up quite a bit, and that I think will continue to evolve.\n",
      "I think importantly, as we think about our Corporate Lending activity, you'll note that actually we've been very disciplined about how we want to deploy balance sheet. And part of that again is a by-product of the revenue sharing that we've implemented, where there's been healthy debate and discussion around the names that we want to continue to serve, and whether they're positioned to take advantage of the broader platform that we have.\n",
      "And so, I think the space will continue to evolve. I think there's been good, healthy demand, despite continued strong balance sheets and part of that demand has been because of where rates are likely to go and continue to evolve. And I think we're well-positioned to be thoughtful about that, but Jane, you may want to add a couple points to it.\n",
      "Jane Fraser (CEO): Yeah, look, around the world, the corporate client base and our Commercial Banking mid-market client base have very healthy balance sheets and we're also seeing market access gradually opening up as well, which is also helpful for – to the quality issuers across all asset classes. We're seeing both the issuers taking advantage as well as the investors. The deals are well over-subscribed. So, that's also been beneficial as corporates think about their financing needs.\n",
      "The other piece I’d just pop out there as well is the recent large Mergers & Acquisitions announcements in multiple industries is a sign of rising confidence from CEOs and boards and active discussions are increasing, as supportive capital markets create confidence, as people think about larger strategic transactions. This is going to feed acquisition finance, bridge financing and some of the higher-margin capital markets and lending activity as well.\n",
      "So, as we look forward, I think it's recognizing the shift in some of the drivers from company just investing, refinancing, looking at where they can diversify their capital raising in different quarters. But I'd just close by saying I couldn't agree with you more about geopolitical risks and fragility. I think the market's too benign in its risk pricing on some of these factors.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 3, Justification: Management directly addressed their firm's underwriting standards, stating they have not shifted and remain disciplined. However, the response was vague regarding the broader competitive landscape and did not directly answer whether spreads are widening or are expected to widen due to geopolitical risks, instead offering a general opinion on market pricing.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Erika Najarian (Analyst): Hi. Good afternoon. So, clearly, the theme of this that's emerging on the Q&A is a healthy skepticism about the revenue targets in line with the – in light of the expense declines, which is not really us analysts, we're sort of a little bit parroting what we're hearing from long-only investors that haven't yet jumped into the stock. So, to that end, I guess I'm going to ask Ebrahim's question differently, and then ask a question about card late fees.\n",
      "How are you balancing – clearly, your valuation would demand that the buybacks be ramped up from $500 million. But growing revenues at a 4% to 5% Compound Annual Growth Rate would mean potentially some capital plowed back into the business. I guess how are you balancing that, especially given that the demand for buyback is louder at Citi than any other money center peer? And could you give us a sense of what card late fees are and how that would impact the $80 billion to $81 billion for the year if we do get an earlier implementation than October?\n",
      "Mark Mason (CFO): Yeah. Thank you, Erika. On the first part of the question, I'd just remind you and everyone else that we're playing for the long-term here, right. So, we have set some medium-term targets. Obviously, Jane has recasted the vision and the strategy. I think we're making very good progress against that, but we're playing for the long-term. And what that means is that we have to continue to invest in the franchise.\n",
      "It's why I've given you a range around the expenses, at least in part. It's why I've continued to stress the importance of protecting the Transformation and risk and control spend. And it's why I started the answer to Ebrahim's question by saying that we want to be sure that we can match the client demand out there, where the returns to do so makes sense. And so, we are having to balance kind of the use of capital and other resources against that longer term strategic objective and utilize it where it makes sense and generates good returns against the idea of returning that to shareholders.\n",
      "And so, we'll continue to do that. It's an everyday assessment. It's an everyday discussion with the teams. Frankly, it's why things like the revenue sharing has been put in place to intensify the discussion around the clients that we're using balance sheet with and ensuring that we're driving broader revenues across the platform. And so, that's kind of how we're operating in terms of making that trade-off on a regular basis, in addition to obviously the broader regulatory environment that we're in.\n",
      "In terms of the second part of your question around late fees, we haven't disclosed kind of the dollar amount of the late fees. What I would say is that we did and have factored that into the $80 billion to $81 billion. And the only thing I'd add to that is it did kind of – it's being implemented a bit earlier than what we had assumed. But again, it's inside of the range of the guidance that I've given you for top line revenue for the year.\n",
      "Jane Fraser (CEO): I’d also, just as a reminder, 85% of our two card portfolios are prime, and in CRS, where you tend to see some of the lower income households, we do have that – the economics of the fee change will be shared with our partners in CRS. So, we want our customers to pay on time. We have a number of mechanisms to do so. But in terms of the economics, I think we, along with the rest of the industry, will be putting in mitigating actions over time, some of which we've already begun to implement.\n",
      "Mark Mason (CFO): Good add, thank you.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 4, Justification: The management's response to the capital allocation question was largely evasive, relying on general statements about long-term strategy and balancing investments against shareholder returns without providing specific details on *how* this balance is being achieved or why buybacks aren't significantly ramped up despite investor demand. While the response to the late fees question was more direct in stating the amount is not disclosed but factored into guidance, the overall clarity is diminished by the significant vagueness on the first, more strategic, inquiry.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "KEN USDIN (Analyst): Got it. Okay. And just one follow-up on the Office of the Comptroller of the amendment and that's specifically related to the Resource Review Plan. Do you have a line of sight on how long that'll take you guys to finish because it seems like – and is that what we should be thinking about in terms of just understanding like what the side of what you need to get done in terms of the other language that's written in the order?\n",
      "JANE FRASER (CEO): So, Ken, look, the Resource Review Plan is just that. It's a plan to ensure that we have sufficient resources allocated towards achieving a timely and sustainable compliance to the order.\n",
      "Essentially if an area is delayed or looking as if it could be, we'll determine what additional resourcing, if any, is required to get back on track and then we'll share that with the Office of the Comptroller of the in a more formalized way than we do today and we obviously review this pretty constantly ourselves.\n",
      "We're already working on the plan. After it's finalized with the Office of the Comptroller of the it will be confidential supervisory information that we can't disclose. So, we won't be able to tell you that the plan is, what the nature of the plan is going to be, but it won't be much more complicated than what we talked about. And we're expecting to get it, we're not expecting this to take long.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 2, Justification: The CEO directly addresses the confidentiality of the Resource Review Plan, explaining why its details cannot be disclosed. While the timeline given ('not expecting this to take long') is vague, it provides a qualitative answer rather than completely avoiding the question about duration.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Steven Chubak (Analyst): Hey, Jane. Hey, Mark. Did want to ask on Dodd-Frank Act Stress Test and SCB just recognizing this will be the last opportunity before the results come out. The macro scenario, Fed assumptions look quite similar to last year but just given the significant transformation that's underway, repositioning actions, which admittedly depressed earnings last year, want to get a sense as to whether there are any idio-factors that could result in greater SCB volatility in the coming exam and just broader thoughts on longer-term trajectory for the SCB, just given the org simplification efforts that are underway.\n",
      "Mark Mason (CFO): Yeah, Steven the first part of your question is just impossible to answer to be candid with you, right. I mean it's – we obviously have an internal based scenario we've run. We have a severely adverse scenario that we've run. We've provided a balance sheet as part of the submission, but ultimately, the regulators have to run through their models, the information that we've provided and that informs what happens with the stress capital buffer, and we don't have as much transparency to that as we'd like and so really hard to call at this stage.\n",
      "The second part of your question I think is spot-on and I kind of alluded to in my prepared remarks in that we have the medium-term targets that we've set and we're still in the midst of kind of the execution of our strategy, the evolution of the business mix and the business model. The mix towards more consistent, predictable and repeatable revenue streams that would impact PPNR, the simplification which obviously plays through an expense base that'll be lower when we get to that medium-term period.\n",
      "So all of those things, the divestitures and kind of what that means and how that might impact the Global Systemically Important Banks score and the like and the freeing up of capital which we've already freed up $6 billion or so, and so all of those things have kind of yet to have been factored in and we believe will be beneficial to the SCB over the medium-term.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 3, Justification: The CFO directly and thoroughly addressed the longer-term trajectory of the SCB by detailing strategic actions and their expected positive impact. However, for the immediate SCB volatility question, he stated it was \"impossible to answer,\" deflecting by citing the lack of transparency into the regulator's models rather than discussing potential internal \"idio-factors\" that could influence volatility, thereby only partially addressing the core of that specific query.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "JIM MITCHELL (Analyst): That's helpful. And maybe just quickly, kind of a similar question on expenses. Better-than-expected this quarter, but there was no restructuring or repositioning charges. I think to get to the high end of your range, you'd have to be up a little bit in the back half from 2Q run rate. Is that because you expect more repositioning, restructuring in the second half or maybe just talk through expense trajectory from here?\n",
      "MARK MASON (CFO): Yeah, so that's right. When I talk about it at the first quarter, I talked about kind of a downward trend for each of the quarters after Q1. The second quarter came in a bit lower than we were expecting. I'm sticking with the guidance and it does mean that the back half of the year will likely come in – will come in higher than the second quarter. That's a combination of a couple of things, including the pace of hiring and investment that we will do in the transformation work that has to be done. It also includes repositioning charges that we might take or need to take as we continue to work through our businesses across the firm and the franchise and then the second quarter did or – yeah, the second quarter did have a one-time or so and some delayed spending that will pick up in the third and fourth quarter around advertising and marketing and some of the other line items. So, yes, the third and fourth quarter, the back half will be higher than the second quarter, but consistent with the guidance that I've given.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 1, Justification: The CFO's answer is very direct and comprehensive. He confirms the expected increase in expenses in the back half of the year and provides multiple specific reasons, including the pace of hiring, investment in transformation work, and explicitly mentions potential repositioning charges, directly addressing the analyst's specific inquiry. He also clarifies the impact of one-time items and delayed spending from the second quarter, leaving little to no ambiguity about the expense trajectory.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "SAUL MARTINEZ (Analyst): You don't? Right. Okay.\n",
      "MARK MASON (CFO): No, I don't. Right.\n",
      "SAUL MARTINEZ (Analyst): Fair enough. That was as clear as can be.\n",
      "MARK MASON (CFO): Thank you.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 1, Justification: The CFO's response \"No, I don't\" is a clear and definitive answer. The analyst's subsequent remark, \"That was as clear as can be,\" explicitly confirms the directness and lack of evasion in the response, indicating the question was fully addressed.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "BETSY GRASECK (Analyst): Okay. Great. Thank you very much. Appreciate that.\n",
      "VIVEK JUNEJA (Analyst): Hi. Let me just clarify this, Mark and Jane, just to make sure that we all have it right. The $53.5 billion to $53.8 billion does not include anything thus far on what you think you may need to spend on the Resource Review Plan, meaning what additional resources you would have to put to fix the consent order. Am I right there?\n",
      "JANE FRASER (CEO): No, you're not right. So, I think as you've heard us talk about, Vivek, for a while now, that we knew the areas that we were behind in elements of our transformation program and that we began addressing those and making the investments. Some of that's in people. Some of that is in technology spend. It's using different tools and capabilities to get areas addressed earlier and we began that earlier in the year and you saw that acknowledged as well by our regulators who pointed to the fact that we've already begun addressing the areas that we're behind.\n",
      "Mark?\n",
      "MARK MASON (CFO): That's right, Jane, and what you have heard is that despite having to spend more, some $250 million or so more, we're not changing the guidance, right. And so, we have, as Jane mentioned, we have worked on areas already that we've needed to and we have looked for ways to absorb that and are doing so within our guidance.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 1, Justification: The executives directly answer the analyst's specific question about whether the guidance excludes spending on the Resource Review Plan, stating explicitly that it does not. They clarify that these investments are already being made and absorbed within the stated guidance, even quantifying some of the additional spend that has been accommodated.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "GLENN SCHORR (Analyst): Okay. Appreciate all that. One quickie on Debt Capital Markets. You had amazingly good performance. There's been plenty of conversation about pull forward this year on just refi driving like three-quarters of the activity. Could you just help us think through the second half when thinking about Debt Capital Markets just to make sure that we don't like start modelling this into perpetuity?\n",
      "JANE FRASER (CEO): Look, I think when we think about the back half of 2024, we're going to see a different mix of activity in Banking. We do still expect demand to be quite strong across our capital market products because you've got a wall of maturing debt securities coming up in the second half that carry on for a couple of years. But, we did see some clients accelerating issuances into the first half getting ahead of potential market volatility. So, if you put it all together, I think we expect the rate environment and the financing markets to continue to be accommodative as well as to continue deal making with Mergers & Acquisitions being a bit larger in the overall mix, although some of the regulatory elements have put a damper on part of that.\n",
      "MARK MASON (CFO): Yeah. Only thing I'd add to that is, look, the wallet for the year is obviously going to depend on a couple things, so, one, the return of a more normalized IPO market, two, the direction and volatility of interest rates, the ongoing global conflicts that we're all kind of seeing and witnessing, and then finally, as Jane mentioned in her remarks, the elections and what those outcomes look like, not just in the US, but abroad. And so there are a number of factors there that will play to the wallet. But as we said, we believe we're well-positioned to be there to serve our clients and to do so in a way that makes good economic sense.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 3, Justification: The executives acknowledge the 'pull forward' concern and mention relevant demand drivers like maturing debt. However, they broaden the discussion to general capital market conditions and macroeconomic factors, stopping short of providing a clear, specific outlook or trajectory for Debt Capital Markets performance in the second half, which was the core of the analyst's modeling question.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "MIKE MAYO (Analyst): Hi. Could you elaborate more on the amended consent order, Jane? You said it was disappointing to have gotten that this week. It's almost four years into the consent order. And a little bit why it hasn't been resolved and what's on, that's the loss column and maybe a little bit more on the win column too. I mean, you have what 12,000 people thrown at the problem. Billions of dollars. Is it not enough people? Is it not enough money? Do you need to look at it in a different way? Are you not talking the same language?\n",
      "I mean, you have John Dugan as your lead independent director, ex head of the Office of the Comptroller of the, and it seems like you got your report card. I guess you passed overall. They went out of their way to say some nice things, but it looks like you got failing grades in data and regulatory management. So, you're confident it's going to be resolved, but it's already been four years and it hasn't been resolved. So what is it going to take from here and how can you resolve the regulatory concerns while continuing or serving shareholders better? And then in the win column, since it's so nebulous this back office, what are you achieving? You mentioned some items, but if you could put more meat on those bones. Thanks.\n",
      "JANE FRASER (CEO): Yes. Thank you, Mike. That's a few different parts to that, so let's start by just taking a step back. Our transformation is addressing decades of under-investment in large parts of Citi's infrastructure and in our risk and control environment. And when you unpack that, those areas where we had an absence of enforced enterprise-wide standards and governance, we've had a siloed organization that's prevented scale, a culture where a lot of groups were allowed to solve problem – the same problem in different ways, fragmented tech platforms, manual processes and controls, and a weak first line of defense, too few subject matter experts. So, this is a massive body of work that goes well beyond the consent order and this is not old Citi putting in Band-Aids. This is Citi tackling the root issues head on. It's a multiyear undertaking as we've talked about and you saw the statement by one of our regulators this week, we have made meaningful progress on our transformation and on our simplification.\n",
      "Mark?\n",
      "MARK MASON (CFO): Yeah, and so as Jane says, the progress that we've made, it spans multiple parts of the consent order and transformation work. Remember, that consent order and transformation work includes risk, it includes controls, it includes compliance, it includes data and data related to the regulatory reporting, and we've got evidence and proof points of progress against all of those things.\n",
      "JANE FRASER (CEO): Thank you, Mark. So transforming, to answer your question about how do we fix it and serve our investors at the same time. Transforming Citi will drive benefits for our shareholders, our clients, and our regulators. This is not mutually exclusive.\n",
      "At the beginning of the year, we honed in on two priorities, the transformation and improving our business performance, and we're able to do so because we've largely cleared the decks. We have a clear focus strategy, we've executed the divestitures, we've got a much simpler organization, so we can focus on these two priorities and we are able to do both.\n",
      "You can see that in our results again this quarter, multiple, solid proof points on the execution of the strategy and we know what we need to do on both fronts. We have plans in place on the transformation and on the strategy and we're executing against them. We have been and we will be transparent when we have issues and how we're addressing them.\n",
      "MARK MASON (CFO): And just to add a couple of data points to that, Mike. You've heard us mention some of these before, but we've retired platforms. We've reduced the number of data centers. Platforms are down some 300. We've moved from 39 corporate loan platforms down to south of 20. We've got 20 cash equities execution platforms down to 1; we've reduced the 6 reporting ledgers down to 1; 11 sanctions platforms down to 1. So, we've been making considerable progress over the past couple of years.\n",
      "With that said, there's a lot more work to be done around the data regulatory reporting work. If you think about Citi, we've got 11,000 global total reg reports, right. So, we've got to make sure that the data that's going into those reports is the quality of the data that we want it to be, but more importantly, that we're doing it efficiently, that it doesn't take thousands of people to reconcile that information and so this is an end-to-end process in the way we're approaching it.\n",
      "One example is the 2052a liquidity report that we have. It has 750,000 lines of data and that data is, it's important again that we're efficiently collecting it from multiple systems with standards and governance that ensures it's of the quality that we want it to be without again having to have manual activity supporting it.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 4, Justification: The management largely avoided directly addressing why the consent order has not been resolved after four years and why it was amended, including the 'failing grades' mentioned by the analyst. Instead, they focused on the scale and complexity of the ongoing transformation and provided general statements about progress, only offering specific 'win column' metrics rather than confronting the specific issues leading to the current regulatory challenges.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Scott Siefers (Analyst): Good afternoon, everybody. Thanks for taking the questions. Have you all assumed any revenue attrition just related to the reduction in force? And I guess just broadly, how might that be embedded in the 2024 revenue guidance? And I guess just at a top level, maybe just a shot or two on...\n",
      "Jane Fraser (CEO): Sorry, Scott, I didn't hear what it was. I think the phone line cut out. The revenue attrition?\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 4, Justification: The CEO's response indicates a technical issue prevented them from hearing the question clearly. While not an intentional evasion, the question was not addressed or answered, effectively avoiding the direct provision of information. The response redirects the burden back to the analyst to rephrase the question.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "MATT O’CONNOR (Analyst): Okay. And then just separately on the very early kind of part of the prepared remarks, you talked about the dividends being capped in terms of what could be upstream from the bank to the holding company because of the Office of the Comptroller of the that came out this week. For all intents and purposes, like does that impact how you run the company or subsidiary or impact liquidity or capital? I understood the comment, no change to dividends or buybacks at the holding company, but is there any impact from that that we would notice on the outside? Thank you.\n",
      "JANE FRASER (CEO): Look, let's be clear, this action does not impact our ability to return capital to our shareholders. The dividends that are referenced are just intercompany payments from CBNA to the parent. So, first of all, don't confuse what a dividend is here. We will, it's not going to impact how we run the company, the subsidiary, the capital, the liquidity at all and the dividends are not capped.\n",
      "MARK MASON (CFO): Yeah, I think, Jane, that's right. And I think let's not lose sight of the purpose of the orders that are there and the purpose of the orders that are there are to ensure that we're funding and allocating the effort appropriately, right.\n",
      "So, the regulators want essentially the same thing we want, right, is for us to get this done, right, and so that is the primary objective. The reference to the dividending from out of CBNA up to the parent is certainly referenced there between now and establishing that Resource Review Plan. But as Jane mentions, that does not constrain the parent from doing the things that it will need to do. And as opposed to, it's not a cap. What it is, is that anything above the debt service of the parent or the preferred dividends and other nondiscretionary obligations would require a non-objection from the Office of the Comptroller of the.\n",
      "JANE FRASER (CEO): Until the Resource Plan is agreed and as you'll have seen, the Resource Plan needs to be submitted within 30 days, and as I indicated, we're working on that one and not anticipating that to be a problem.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 1, Justification: The answer directly addresses the analyst's question by explicitly stating that the action will not impact how they run the company, the subsidiary, capital, or liquidity. Management also provides clear clarification on the nature of the 'cap' and its temporary status, fully explaining the situation rather than avoiding it.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "STEVEN CHUBAK (Analyst): Hi. Good afternoon. So, Mark, I have a fairly technical question on Deferred Tax Assets utilization and specifically the NOLs. The deduction is still fairly significant at $12 billion. It roughly equates to about 10% of your market cap. And the good news here, I suppose, is that it should come back into capital over time, but we've seen very little utilization over the past two years despite the firm being profitable. And so wanted to better understand this, what's constraining your ability to utilize those DTAs and are there catalysts on the horizon that could help accelerate that utilization beyond organic earnings generation?\n",
      "MARK MASON (CFO): Yes. Thank you. So, I'm going to give you a very simple answer to a very complicated question. It really comes down to driving US income, right. And so, we are focused on not just all of the things that we've mentioned, but driving higher income in the US. That allows for us to utilize the disallowed Deferred Tax Assets. We saw some of that in the quarter and we expect to see more of it as we move through the medium term, but that is the major driver of that utilization.\n",
      "JANE FRASER (CEO): And we have many of our business heads very much focused around that opportunity as well. So, winning in the US is a very important leg, for example, of the strategy that Vis is refreshing. Similarly, we see opportunities from the Commercial Bank. We see it in Wealth. We see it in, obviously in US Personal Banking and in Services. So, we're very, we're focused from a business strategy point of view on this, not just from the financial side.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 4, Justification: The answer broadly states that driving US income is the key to DTA utilization, which is somewhat self-evident. However, it fails to address the analyst's specific questions regarding the underlying *constraints* that have limited utilization despite past profitability, or *specific catalysts* on the horizon beyond general organic earnings generation. The response remains at a high-level strategic focus rather than providing a technical or specific explanation for the issues raised.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "MATT O’CONNOR (Analyst): Hi. Apologies if I missed it in the opening remarks, but what drove the decline in credit card revenues from 1Q to 2Q? Looks like they were down about 6% in aggregate even though average loans went up, spending went up. What was the driver of that?\n",
      "MARK MASON (CFO): Credit card revenues, seasonality.\n",
      "JANE FRASER (CEO): Yeah, seasonality.\n",
      "MARK MASON (CFO): Seasonality playing through there sequentially. Yeah.\n",
      "JANE FRASER (CEO): I think if you look year-over-year, you'll be able to see a pretty common trend there. The consumer is slowing in some of the, in the spend, as Mark had referred to, Matt. And a lot of the spending and the growth areas we are seeing and underlying numbers is being driven by the affluent customer.\n",
      "MARK MASON (CFO): Yeah. I think there's also the dynamic on the CRS of the reward or across the portfolio of rewards playing through from one quarter to the other, so the combination of those things are playing through the revenue line there.\n",
      "JANE FRASER (CEO): But nothing that's particularly worrying us, Matt.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 3, Justification: The management provides \"seasonality\" and \"rewards\" as drivers for the revenue decline but offers minimal detail on how these factors specifically led to a 6% drop, especially when average loans and spending reportedly increased. While some reasons are given, the explanation is generic and doesn't fully reconcile with the analyst's specific observations, leaving the core dynamic somewhat unclear.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "BETSY GRASECK (Analyst): Hi good afternoon. So, I know we talked a lot about expenses. I just have one kind of overarching question here, which is on how we should think about the path of expenses between now and the medium term, as we have come quite a long way in the simplification process. Maybe if you could give us a sense as to how far along simplification impact on expenses we are? And overlapping with the regulatory requirements, do these net out or are we skewed a little bit more towards regulatory requirements being a bit heavier than what's left on simplification from here? Thanks.\n",
      "MARK MASON (CFO): So, thank you, Betsy. I guess I'd say a couple things. So, I think we said it in the past. So, the target for the medium term, we think 2026 is somewhere around $51 billion to $53 billion of expenses. As we've said, we'll have about $1.5 billion in savings related to the restructuring that we've done and another $500 million to $1 billion related to net expense reductions from eliminating the stranded costs as well as additional productivity over that medium-term period. And so, we've made, I think, very good headway, as Jane has mentioned, in the org simplification and the restructuring charges associated with that. Those saves will have started to generate. Some of those saves in the early part of that, meaning this year, will likely be offset by continued investment that we're making in areas of the business like transformation, but also in business-led or driven growth. And you should expect in terms of the trend that we would have a downward trend towards 2026 in achieving that range.\n",
      "JANE FRASER (CEO): And I just want to reiterate, we remain confident that we will meet our 11% to 12% Return on Average Tangible Common Equity target over the medium term. And we've got the, we have the ability to manage the different elements we've been talking about today, making sure that we're investing sufficient resources into the transformation so we can be on track with that, as well as in our businesses, as well as the return of capital to our shareholders. So, we feel confident around that and good about it, we can manage this.\n",
      "MARK MASON (CFO): Yeah, I think that's a great point, Jane. Look, the reality is, as was pointed out earlier, we spent about $3 billion last year, a little bit under that, on the transformation-related work. And the plan has called for us to spend a little bit more than that this year. And frankly, in the first half of the year, as we work through the transformation work and some of the things that Jane and I have mentioned earlier in the year that we've been focused on, like data and data related to regulatory reporting, we've had to spend more than we had planned for in the first half, right, and we've done that and we funded that.\n",
      "We've been able to find productivity opportunities that allow for us to still stay within the guidance that we've given for the full year. So, we are managing this entire expense base, right, so not – the whole $53 billion plus of it, we are actively managing that with an eye towards what's required from a transformation point of view to keep it on track, to accelerate in areas where we're behind and to shore up areas where we're tracking in accordance to what the order requires and where are the other inefficiencies that can allow for us to free up the expense base? And so, things like the work that Andy Sieg has done with the finance team around that expense base and finding efficiencies there are opportunities that we've been able to tease out of the business. Things that we have done in parts of U.S. Personal Banking and that we have continued to get after in parts of Banking, which you see in the down 10% this quarter are areas where we've been keenly focused on, where are there duplicative roles, where are there inefficient processes that we can actually drive greater efficiency out of. So, longwinded way of saying, we understand the expense guidance that we've given, we also understand and stress the importance of funding the transformation with what's required and we're doing both.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 2, Justification: The management provides a clear medium-term expense target and details savings initiatives. They also directly acknowledge increased spending on transformation and regulatory requirements, stating they are finding productivity to offset these. While they explain how they manage the interplay of these factors to stay within guidance, they do not explicitly state if remaining simplification savings fully \"net out\" or if regulatory requirements are \"heavier\" going forward, providing an explanation of dynamic management rather than a direct comparative answer.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "ERIKA NAJARIAN (Analyst): Got it. And my second question is for Jane and I'm sure you're getting tired of the question on capital return. So, you're buying back $1 billion, you plan to buy back $1 billion this quarter. It looks like you didn't buy back any in the second quarter. And I'm asking this question in this context because consensus has a buyback of nearly $1 billion in the fourth quarter and staying at this rate for the first half of next year and ramping higher. And I guess, is the $1 billion number a catch-up pace because you didn't buy back any in the second quarter? And I fully appreciate that you also have the Banamex IPO coming, which is different from peers that are also waiting for Basel clarification. But I'm just wondering, do we need to wait for that Banamex IPO for the company to feel comfortable moving away from that quarter-to-quarter guidance? And also, of course, I just want to readdress the beginning of the question when I asked specifically about the pace.\n",
      "JANE FRASER (CEO): Okay. So, we are not going to be giving guidance going forward around our buybacks. We are going to continue to give quarterly and make it a quarterly determination as to the level. And a lot of that is to do with the uncertainty about the forthcoming regulatory changes. I think we were delighted to see a slight reduction in our Stress Capital Buffer, reflecting the financial strength and resiliency of our business model and also good to see the benefits of our strategy playing out. But with the regulatory changes uncertain, that's one of the major factors for us to continue with the quarterly guidance.\n",
      "MARK MASON (CFO): Yeah, that's right. And on the first part of your question, Erika, I'd say, look, we were in discussions with our regulators and we made a prudent call as it relates to buybacks in the quarter for Q2. So, Q3, as we talked about, would be at $1 billion and that should not be necessarily viewed as a run rate level. As Jane mentioned, we'll take it quarter by quarter from here.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 3, Justification: The management clearly states they will continue quarterly buyback determinations due to regulatory uncertainty, directly addressing the frequency of guidance. However, they are vague on whether the $1 billion buyback is a 'catch-up' for the prior quarter's inaction, stating only it should not be viewed as a 'run rate.' They also completely omit any discussion of the Banamex IPO's potential impact on their comfort with future guidance.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "MIKE MAYO (Analyst): Yeah, just to say real short follow-up to that. So you're doing all this great stuff, but you still fell short, just in like one sentence, despite doing all of this great stuff that you described, the regulator still said you didn't get it done. Why, after doing all that, didn't you get it done in the eyes of the regulators and why will it be fixed now? Just like a one sentence explanation for that if you have it.\n",
      "JANE FRASER (CEO): I always said that a transformation of this magnitude over multiple years would not be linear. We have many steps forward. We have setbacks. We adjust, we learn from them, we move forward and we get back on track.\n",
      "MARK MASON (CFO): And Mike, if I could just put one number into context because you played back the 11,000, which was a number of global regulatory reports across the landscape here. There are probably 15 to 30 that are core US reports that are pivotal to our US regulators and a lot of what we're discussing here is about ensuring that we're prioritizing the data that impacts those 15 to 30 reports as we work through this.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 4, Justification: The CEO's response is a generic statement about transformation not being linear, avoiding the specific reasons for failing to meet regulator expectations. The CFO provides context on regulatory reports but also fails to explain why the efforts fell short or how they will be fixed now, instead focusing on prioritizing data without linking it directly to the analyst's pointed question about the shortfall.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "KEN USDIN (Analyst): Hey, thanks, good morning. Hey, Mark. Talking about the Net Interest Income outlook and the fact that now we've got a little bit of a discrepancy starting between US rates, maybe higher for longer, and then the beginnings of some of the non-US curve starting to, at least put fourth their first cut. I know we've got that good chart that you have in the Qs about the relative contributions. Can you just help us understand a little bit of like just generally how you're thinking through that discrepancy and how that informs the difference between US-related Net Interest Income and non-US-related Net Interest Income as you go forward?\n",
      "MARK MASON (CFO): Yeah, thank you. So look, I think that as we look at it, out through the – certainly through the medium term, we expect to see continued Net Interest Income growth at obviously a modest level, certainly lower than what we've seen historically and that's in large part because or in part I should say because of how we've been managing the balance sheet and that has allowed for us to reinvest as securities have rolled off and earn a higher yield on them relative to what we were earning, in some instances, they were five-year terms on some of these investments. And so we still think there's some upside from a reinvestment point of view.\n",
      "The point you make around kind of non-US dollar or US rates kind of coming off, that'll play through a little bit as we think about the beta increases that we're expecting outside of the US. And so, we've assumed that we have higher betas pick up outside of the US. If rates kind of come off in a more substantive way, then we could see kind of a little less Net Interest Income pressure than we're forecasting there. But net-net, as I think about the combination of volume growth that we're expecting between loans and deposits over that medium term, the higher yield we can earn on our assets, combined with the pricing capabilities that we have across the portfolio, offsetting some of that beta, we believe we'll have continued Net Interest Income growth.\n",
      "As I think about what I often point to in terms of the IRE analysis and you have to remember that that is a shock to the current balance sheet and it assumes that the full curve is moving simultaneously, cross currencies. And in that case, the 100 basis point parallel shift downward would be a negative $1.6 billion, with about $1.3 billion coming from non-US dollar. But again, that does assume that all of those currencies come down at the same time and doesn't account for the rebalancing of the balance sheet and things that I mentioned like the reinvestment higher yields that we'd be able to earn.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 4, Justification: The CFO acknowledges the discrepancy in US and non-US rates but largely avoids directly explaining how they are thinking through this specific divergence and its differential impact on US versus non-US Net Interest Income. While some relevant information is provided (e.g., non-US betas, IRE analysis), the IRE analysis is immediately qualified as assuming simultaneous rate movements, which contradicts the premise of the question. The answer frequently reverts to general NII growth expectations rather than detailing the specific breakdown requested.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "VIVEK JUNEJA (Analyst): Hi. Sorry, just to follow up on this whole consent order stuff, Jane. What do you think this does in terms of timing, how much longer for you to sort of get this past you? Are you talking couple of years? Is it now longer by a year? Any sense of that? Any sense of helping us think through that?\n",
      "JANE FRASER (CEO): Look, in terms of the consent order and the areas we've had delays, there are four areas to the consent order. It's risk management, it's data governance, it's around compliance and it's around control. As we've said, we were falling behind in certain areas related to data and we've been investing to address the areas that we were behind. We also saw an increase in the scope related to regulatory reporting, so we added some more bodies of work there and we're well underway. So, we are not expecting this to extend the original expectations that we have on when we will complete the body of work for the consent order.\n",
      "We have a target state for the different areas of it. We have the plan to achieve those target states. We'll make the investments necessary to ensure that we do so. We'll try and get this done as quickly, but as robustly as possible and we're doing this by making strategic fixes and investments rather than, what I would call, the old Citi way, which is a series of Band-Aids that remediate, but don't actually fix the underlying issue and that way, we are delivering for our shareholders as well as our regulators and our clients because we're putting in strategic solutions that will benefit all, but I'm not expecting this to change the timeframes.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 2, Justification: The CEO directly addresses the analyst's primary concern about whether recent issues will extend the consent order timeline, stating firmly that she does not expect changes to the original timeframes. While she doesn't provide a new specific estimated completion date or reiterate the original one, she clearly answers the question regarding the impact of the delays on the expected duration.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "VIVEK JUNEJA (Analyst): Okay. So, going forward, even though this plan is still to be sort of put together and approved by the regulators, we should not expect any change to this expense guidance?\n",
      "MARK MASON (CFO): Look, the plan, the Resource Review Plan, as Jane mentioned, is what we're working through now with the regulators. That will be a process for demonstrating to them that we are spending and allocating the appropriate resources to accomplishing the commitments that we have. Appropriate resources can range from people to technology to enhancing our processes and ensuring better execution.\n",
      "If you think about what that will entail, it will entail areas where we are delayed or behind as we identify those areas, being able to tease out the root cause of any delay and ensure that we've got proper funding allocated to get it back on track and that's me framing out how I think about what something like this might look like. And so, what we're saying is that if we identify issues in the quarters to come, that we haven't identified already, that's the process we're going to apply to those issues. And as you've heard us say repeatedly, we're going to spend whatever is necessary to then get those things back on track. And as we've done thus far this year, we're going to look for opportunities to absorb those headwinds. I hope that's clear.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 5, Justification: The CFO provides a lengthy explanation of the Resource Review Plan, the process for allocating resources, and the commitment to spend 'whatever is necessary.' However, he completely avoids directly answering whether the existing expense guidance should be expected to change. He offers process details instead of a financial commitment regarding the guidance.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Gerard Cassidy (Analyst): Mark, you touched on in your prepared comments about growing the US Personal Banking Return on Average Tangible Common Equity to higher levels. And you mentioned two items. One, innovative products and the normalization of credit costs. Can you elaborate on those two items that will be contributing to the driver aside from the efficiency improvement that you also touched on?\n",
      "Mark Mason (CFO): Yeah, sure. So obviously U.S. Personal Banking is a combination of the cards businesses that we have in the Retail Banking business and that cards portfolio has both Branded as well as Retail Services as part of it.\n",
      "And even within Branded, we have proprietary cards where we frankly have been looking to how we can come up with new innovative products.\n",
      "One example of product innovation is the recent refresh that we did of our Strata Premier Card which was designed to drive acquisition and engagement with a new rewards offering. And with that acquisitions are up some 7% both quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year for Branded Cards so that's an example of product innovation.\n",
      "Another one is we also launched FlexPay at Costco a few quarters ago and you can see good instalment loan growth as a consequence of that, up some 15% or so.\n",
      "And so that type of product creation is important to acquisitions, it's important to ensuring the card stays top of wallet and important to driving some of that top line performance.\n",
      "And then the other thing that I mentioned, you're right was around cost of credit and that really is the continued normalization of cost of credit.\n",
      "I mentioned a couple of times now the idea that multiple vintages are maturing at the same time. And that has to play through for us to kind of see a more normal level of credit and that will be important to the returns.\n",
      "And again, we are starting to see stabilization in both the cost of credit line but also in delinquencies and that's a good indicator for us.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 1, Justification: The CFO directly addresses both parts of the analyst's question. He provides specific examples of innovative products and elaborates on the normalization of credit costs, explaining how both factors contribute to the stated goal.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Ebrahim Poonawala (Analyst): Good morning. I guess maybe, Mark, for you, like looking at slide 7 on Net Interest Income, and maybe we can break it down into Markets and ex-Markets. In the ex-Markets Net Interest Income, $11.96 billion this quarter, based on what you've said, the back book repricing, deposit flex, is it safe to conclude that the ex-Markets Net Interest Income bottomed in 2Q 2024? And I noticed the securities yield actually went lower, 7 Basis Points quarter-over-quarter. So was there something one-off that impacted the yield this quarter relative to the expectations you outlined earlier?\n",
      "Mark Mason (CFO): So when you look at slide 7, you got a couple of things playing through. So your point around the low number, the low print, $11.46 billion in the second quarter, that really is a combination relative to first quarter of Foreign Exchange translation, some seasonally lower card balances, and lower interest payments in Argentina playing through that sequential 1Q to 2Q.\n",
      "The third quarter, as I mentioned earlier, is really a by-product of volumes on the lending side and spreads, deposit spreads in Services and Wealth and I think that I've already given kind of the guide for the fourth quarter where that is likely to be flat.\n",
      "But I think it's important to just remind everyone of the headwinds and tailwinds that play through this Net Interest Income line.\n",
      "And from a tailwind point of view, I would expect to see continued volume from loans, U.S. Personal Banking in particular but also Services and we're talking ex-Markets, so Services.\n",
      "I'd also expect to see continued benefit from the reinvestment of securities at higher yields and then we're actively managing beta as it relates to with our clients and if you think about kind of what we saw in the uptick of rates, we're actively managing that on the down tick as it relates to our institutional clients.\n",
      "I think the other point here is let's not forget that our interest rate sensitivity skews more towards non-US and so a lot of what we think about and talk about tends to be how US rates move and the betas around that.\n",
      "We're still going to have a bit of beta catch-up outside of the US and so that's one of the headwinds there as well as the Legacy Franchise exits.\n",
      "So you've got this long-winded way of saying, I do expect flat into the fourth quarter. I'm not going to give guidance for 2025.\n",
      "But what I will say is to keep the growth momentum to get to our medium-term targets, that's 4% to 5% of a Compound Annual Growth Rate and that's going to be a combination of Net Interest Income and Non-interest Revenue but skewing Non-interest Revenue.\n",
      "And I want to point that out because the third quarter and the year-to-date numbers that you see in our performance shows very strong fee Non-interest Revenue growth across each of these five businesses and I don't want to lose sight of that as you all really try to get a handle on how we get to that medium term.\n",
      "We're evidencing that shift towards more fee revenue as we speak. So I'll stop there, but I think that's important and hopefully I've answered your question around the Net Interest Income forecast here.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 4, Justification: The CFO avoids directly confirming whether the ex-Markets Net Interest Income bottomed in Q2, instead pivoting to future NII trends, general headwinds/tailwinds, and long-term financial targets. He also fails to explain the specific 7 basis point decline in securities yield during the quarter, despite the analyst's explicit question.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "SAUL MARTINEZ (Analyst): Second question on, I just want to follow up on U.S. Personal Banking. I still – I get the point that you're seeing a normalization in losses in Cards. But even if I adjust for reserve builds, your Return on Average Tangible Common Equity is still single digits. I would think even at these Net Credit Loss levels, your Cards business is pretty profitable. You're a scale player, you're above sort of pre-pandemic levels, but not – I don't know if I, it doesn't seem like it's that much higher by a dramatic amount. It would seem to imply that the Retail Bank is a huge drag on profitability, even – maybe even losing money, I don't know. But can you just talk about what you can do to sort of improve the Retail Bank profitability and just give anymore color that you can in terms of the path to get to that high-teen Return on Average Tangible Common Equity you talked about?\n",
      "JANE FRASER (CEO): Yeah, let me kick off there, and let's say, look, clearly, we're very focused on improving the returns in U.S. Personal Banking to get us to the high-teens level over the medium term and you've seen us generating healthy positive operating leverage this quarter. We've had a number of quarters of good revenue growth. And as Mark said, we're at the low point of the credit cycle and we knew this year, we would see the pressure on returns from the elevated Net Credit Losses and some of the industry headwinds we've talked about. But as the Net Credit Loss rates approach steady state levels and the mitigating actions that all of us have been putting in place against the industry headwinds, as those take hold, we expect the returns will improve and support the firm-wide medium-term targets.\n",
      "In the Retail Bank, we're continuing to focus on growing share in our six core markets and we're doing that, leveraging our physical and digital assets. It plays an important role in enabling the wealth continuum and the growth that we're looking at in our Wealth franchise. We're continuing to improve our operating efficiency, being very disciplined in expense management and managing carefully the branch and digital productivity of the Retail Bank network. But we're at the high point of the credit cycle. It's driving the low point for U.S. Personal Banking, and as I said in my remarks, we're expecting to see those returns improve from here.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 4, Justification: The CEO acknowledges the low returns and the target but largely avoids directly addressing the analyst's specific concern about the Retail Bank being a \"huge drag\" or potentially losing money. The response attributes current low profitability to the credit cycle and offers general strategies like improving efficiency and growing share, without providing specific actions or a detailed path to significantly improve the Retail Bank's profitability or counter its perceived drag on overall U.S. Personal Banking returns.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Glenn Schorr (Analyst): Hi. Thanks very much. Good guidance. I appreciate it. I'm curious on the card losses in Retail financial services, if you could talk to like, the 2024 exit rate seems like it will be higher than the full year guide at 6.25%. Maybe you could talk to the trajectory there and then the huge reserves that you have built in there and anything you can tell us about the portfolios so we can keep expectations in the right spot. Thanks.\n",
      "Mark Mason (CFO): Yeah, sure. Why don't I take that. Good morning, Glenn.\n",
      "So a couple things. So, one, I think that on Retail Services you're seeing a couple of things kind of play out.\n",
      "So, one, you're seeing kind of spend volumes trend down a bit. You are seeing payment rates come down as well.\n",
      "That obviously is fueling the average interest earning balance growth that we're seeing.\n",
      "And then you are also seeing with the spend volume come down, there's a denominator effect that plays through which pushes up obviously the loss rates that we're seeing.\n",
      "That still in the quarter is in line with our guidance but in light of what we saw earlier in the year and normal seasonality, we would expect that number to be on the higher end of that range and likely higher in the fourth quarter, but the higher in the fourth quarter again depends on what traffic is like and what the holiday spending season looks like through the end of the year.\n",
      "I would say the reserve levels we have are very healthy as it relates to this portfolio. I think in the back of the deck we show kind of the reserve to loan ratio at about 11.7% or so. So well-reserved for the Retail Services portfolio in light of the environment that we're in.\n",
      "Similarly, we are seeing the stabilization from a delinquency point of view across both portfolios kind of play through and so net-net, we are obviously actively managing this.\n",
      "The retail partner activity is a critical component of it and that will drive fourth quarter activity or levels, but we do feel as if we'll end up on the higher end of the range here.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 2, Justification: The CFO directly addresses the expected trajectory of card losses, confirming they anticipate higher rates by year-end (Q4), and provides a specific reserve ratio (11.7%) to show health. While the details on the portfolio are somewhat high-level, they do provide context on delinquency trends and active management, largely answering the core questions without significant deflection.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Jim Mitchell (Analyst): No, that's great color. I appreciate it. And maybe just as a follow-up on the capital question, I guess one thing that's been a bit of a headwind over the last year has been sort of growth from the Deferred Tax Assets deductions. Do we start to see that become a tailwind again? How do we think about that accreting back into capital over the next couple of years?\n",
      "Mark Mason (CFO): Yeah. Look, the main driver of our Deferred Tax Assets utilization will be driving higher income in the US. That's going to be the major driver and as we think about – so as you think about each of the strategies that Jane has described for our business, you will often hear the importance of winning in the US.\n",
      "You'll hear it as it relates to Banking and the activity that we saw, the strong performance we saw this quarter in Vis’s world, you hear it as it relates to the Wealth business and the importance of us growing investments particularly in North America.\n",
      "You see it in U.S. Personal Banking which is largely a US focused business.\n",
      "That Deferred Tax Assets utilization is about us increasing net income or higher net income in the US and as we work to execute on our client driven strategy, we are looking for opportunities to do that.\n",
      "We're incenting the business to drive that momentum and that's what's going to give us a higher utilization on a quarter by quarter in the coming years.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 4, Justification: The CFO explains the main driver for Deferred Tax Assets utilization (higher U.S. income) and strategies to achieve it. However, the answer largely avoids the analyst's specific question about whether DTA will become a \"capital tailwind again\" and \"how it accretes back into capital over the next couple of years,\" offering no quantitative guidance or direct timeline for this capital impact.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "GERARD CASSIDY (Analyst): Thank you, Hi Jane, Hi Mark. Mark, regarding the comments you made about the higher credit losses, the three factors that you gave us, can you also talk about, if this was a factor at all for you folks, was there any Fair Isaacson Company score inflation back during the pandemic that might be playing into these kind of credit losses? And as part of the credit card question, you mentioned the CFPB, the fees that you have factored in, the lower fees – you factored that into your forward-look. Where do we stand on that? Do you guys have any color on that as well?\n",
      "MARK MASON (CFO): Yeah, so, on the first part of the question, look, we all kind of have talked about in the past, the prospect of Fair Isaacson Company inflation back during the COVID period of time. We've been very focused on ensuring that acquisitions that we've made have been appropriately kind of analyzed in the underwriting of that to get comfortable with the quality of new customers that we've been bringing on. In light of the environment, we have looked at moving towards higher Fair Isaacson Company scores for new account acquisitions.\n",
      "But as I think about what we're seeing now, there is that dichotomy that I mentioned where we have the higher Fair Isaacson Company score customers that are driving the spend growth and that frankly have still continued strong balances and savings and it's really the lower Fair Isaacson Company band customers, where we're seeing the sharper drop in payment rates and more borrowing. And so, the Fair Isaacson Company inflation has effectively kind of fizzled out when we look at the mix and dynamic of the customer portfolio that we have at this point.\n",
      "And in terms of the CFPB late fees, well, I don't have an update on that. Like I said, we've built in an assumption in our forecast. But in terms of the timing, I don't have a formal update on the certainty of it.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 3, Justification: The response was mixed. The CFO provided a detailed and direct explanation regarding the Fair Isaacson Company scores, clarifying their impact and current state. However, concerning the CFPB late fees, the CFO explicitly stated not having an update or certainty on the timing, which failed to provide the 'color' or 'where we stand' requested by the analyst. This renders the overall answer only partially addressed.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Glenn Schorr (Analyst): Okay. Thanks for all that, Mark. Just one quickie On your partnership with Apollo, very interesting and in line with a lot of other things we've seen. Curious on how you thought about going with one specific partner versus a group and then more importantly, are there other parts of the franchise that could benefit with stronger ties to private markets, I'm thinking specifically in the asset-backed world. Appreciate it. Thank you.\n",
      "Jane Fraser (CEO): So we're delighted to partner with Apollo because what this does is it's uniting our comprehensive banking reach and expertise together and it's enabling us to offer our clients more innovative and tailored financing solutions.\n",
      "There will be some other partners involved in this as well. Mubadala is another participant in this.\n",
      "And when we look at this, it's very, very beneficial for our clients. We're always looking at how we can best serve our clients, give them the most options and this platform enhances corporate and sponsor clients access to the private lending capital pool at real scale in $25 billion is a very sizable partnership here and it provides funding certainty and strategic transactions.\n",
      "It's exclusive for LBOs, non-investment grade in the US. The US is obviously the bulk of the private credit market, it’s the behemoth globally. It would be great to see that market developing in Europe and it wouldn't surprise me to see us doing more partnerships and other pieces going forward.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 4, Justification: The CEO avoids directly addressing the analyst's question about the strategic thinking behind choosing one specific partner versus a group. Instead, she clarifies that other partners are involved and pivots to the overall benefits of the partnership. While the second part of the question about other areas of the franchise is vaguely acknowledged, the core of the initial inquiry regarding the decision-making process is sidestepped.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Ebrahim Poonawala (Analyst): That's helpful. And agreed on the fee momentum. Just one quick on the Wealth segment. We've seen a considerable progress year-to-date in terms of going from zero ROE to about 8.5% Return on Average Tangible Common Equity, significant operating leverage. I think I heard Jane say that momentum should continue. Is it fair to assume that Return on Average Tangible Common Equity remains, like Wealth remains a positive story as we think about how Citi's ROE continues to improve from here as we get towards the target? Any color on the Wealth side would be helpful. Thank you.\n",
      "Jane Fraser (CEO): Yes, I agree with you. I think we're all very pleased to see the progress on the strategy we laid out at Investor Day.\n",
      "The Wealth target we have in the medium term is 15% to 20% and with that a 25% to 30% operating margin and we're making steady progress there.\n",
      "I think the first piece was putting the pieces of the global wealth organization together and now we're focused on positioning for growth and reshaping the business to deliver the returns that we all expect.\n",
      "A very important part of that is shifting our mix by growing investments. We had 24% growth in client investment assets this quarter. I would call that a good start to realizing the potential that we have here.\n",
      "And at the same time, Andy continues to right-size our expense base and drive productivity. Our advisor productivity increased over 50% in Citigold North America. So a number of different areas that he's focused on so that we can continue to grow the investment space including some important new talent that we've been bringing in that I'm sure you've noticed.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 4, Justification: The CEO provides extensive details about the Wealth segment's internal progress, operational achievements, and specific targets (e.g., 15-20% ROTCE). However, she sidesteps the analyst's core question about whether it is \"fair to assume\" Wealth's continued positive story directly contributes to Citi's overall ROE improvement towards its target, instead focusing on the segment's own performance and internal metrics rather than its explicit impact on the broader company's ROE trajectory.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "STEVEN CHUBAK (Analyst): Thank you, both, for that color. Maybe just a quick follow-up just on the Retail Services business. We are seeing some evidence that your competitors in this space have been more aggressive leading with price in an effort to win some new mandates. And was hoping you could just speak to what you're seeing across the competitor set and your appetite or willingness to potentially offer better economics in response to increased competition from some of your peers.\n",
      "JANE FRASER (CEO): I think you'll be delighted to hear that we're very focused on returns rather than just on revenues. So, when we enter into discussions with a partner who may be a new RFP for their portfolio or looking at new ones such as the one we just agreed with Dillard's, it's all about the returns and the profile of the business rather than the revenue side of things. And it's a shift probably from some other ways in the past, but I'm very pleased with how disciplined the team is being around this and we're seeing the benefits of it.\n",
      "MARK MASON (CFO): Yeah. And that may be different from what you hear and see from other players in the space. But as Jane mentioned, we're keenly focused on ensuring that, yes, we have a good partnership, but that we're generating an appropriate return. That's part of achieving our medium-term targets. And as you know, since you brought up Retail cards, I mean, when we think about how Current Expected Credit Losses works and the reserves you have to establish for these partnerships, we're establishing full, lifetime reserves that's on the balance sheet where ultimately we end up splitting those through the partner sharing economics. So, it's another important consideration as we think about expanding and taking on these relationships and renegotiating partnerships to making sure that returns make good sense for us.\n",
      "JANE FRASER (CEO): Yeah. And Mark and I have no problem saying no to revenue that doesn't come at the right returns and being very disciplined around that.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 2, Justification: The management clearly stated their strategic focus on returns rather than just revenues, directly addressing their appetite to offer \"better economics\" in response to competition. While they did not provide specific details on what they are seeing across the competitor set, their emphasis on disciplined returns implicitly acknowledges a competitive pricing environment, and their stance on willingness was direct.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Mike Mayo (Analyst): So, just one follow-up. When, and you do have the amended consent order that's not new anymore, but is this a problem with your dealing with clients or is this an issue with giving the regulators the information that they need?\n",
      "And just again, you don't, just to confirm, you don't have an asset cap now, is it fair to assume that you don't expect an asset cap any time soon or could you have an asset cap and we don't even know about that? Thanks.\n",
      "Jane Fraser (CEO): We don't have any problems dealing with our clients, quite the opposite.\n",
      "We're a source of strength for our clients in terms of the provision of their payments businesses, their trading businesses, their consumer credit businesses, all across the board.\n",
      "So I would say quite the opposite. We are a source of tremendous strength for them and you see that in the results of this quarter which were very pleasing across the board in every single one of our businesses.\n",
      "We are working closely with our regulators. We incorporate their feedback as well as our own lessons learned.\n",
      "If we fall behind in an element of the consent orders but do understand the breadth of the consent order work as I laid out and the meaningful progress we're making across multiple areas, and when we fall behind in an area we increase the investments needed and look at any lessons learned in the approach and address it.\n",
      "So I feel very comfortable.\n",
      "Mark Mason (CFO): So again, we don't have – we're not talking about issues as it relates to client information, client data, client reporting.\n",
      "We're not talking about information as it relates to financials. We're talking about regulatory reporting, all right.\n",
      "And regulatory reporting as I've mentioned in prior calls, we're a global firm. We've got over 11,000 regulatory reports and we're talking about ensuring that the data that we capture at trade entry is the data that's required to ultimately show up on these various regulatory reports in the way that we need it ensuring that we've got the proper controls on that front end so we don't have to do a lot of the reconciliation and manual adjustments to that data in order to get it how we needed in the report and ensuring we have standardized rules and controls around that process so that we can do it as efficiently as possible.\n",
      "But this is largely around ensuring that we improve those regulatory reports that we have to produce by starting with the underlying data that's required to do that.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 4, Justification: The management provided clear and direct answers regarding the nature of the consent order issues, confirming they relate to regulatory reporting and not client interactions. However, they completely ignored the analyst's multi-part question about a potential asset cap, failing to provide any information on whether they currently have one, expect one, or if it could be undisclosed. This complete omission of a significant portion of the question makes the overall response evasive.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Vivek Juneja (Analyst): And you don't expect anything meaningful, Jane, that will impact business like there was this new story about China, some license that you didn't get approved by the regulators. Anything more meaningful like that that might be occurring that may be...\n",
      "Jane Fraser (CEO): Absolutely – let me be crystal clear, absolutely nothing.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 1, Justification: The CEO's response is exceptionally direct and unambiguous. She uses strong, definitive language to clearly state that there is 'absolutely nothing' more meaningful occurring that could impact the business, directly answering the analyst's question without any hedging or redirection.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Gerard Cassidy (Analyst): Very good. And then just following up on credit. In the Banking division, you guys mentioned the cost of credit was, I think, $177 million due to Allowance for Credit Losses build of $141 million. And it was due to a change in the mix in the portfolio. Can you share with us what that mix change was that drove this provision?\n",
      "Mark Mason (CFO): It's a mix of kind of different asset classes and clients that we've lent against. There's nothing material or significant in that number.\n",
      "When you look at the nonaccrual loans that ratio still 31 basis points. So it's a mix change of our exposures but nothing material there.\n",
      "Jane Fraser (CEO): And we continue to see a very healthy corporate sector really across the world.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 5, Justification: The analyst specifically asked for details on the portfolio mix change that drove the Allowance for Credit Losses build. Management provided only generic statements like \"a mix of kind of different asset classes and clients\" and explicitly refused to elaborate, stating it was \"nothing material.\" The CEO then shifted the topic entirely to the health of the corporate sector, demonstrating a clear and complete avoidance of the specific question.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Erika Najarian (Analyst): Perfect. Thank you. And as a follow-up question, I'm sure it is frustrating for you to see the stock reaction in a quarter where you had PPNR strength and better expectations for net interest income in the fourth quarter.\n",
      "So maybe I'll frame the question this way for you, Mark. As we think about the gyrations in interest rate expectations globally, may be remind us sort of is it fair to assume that Citi is asset sensitive internationally and neutrally positioned domestically?\n",
      "How should we think about late fees? I know you told us that late fees going to $8 were part of your initial guide for the year.\n",
      "And additionally, I think perhaps because capital markets is so strong across the board, across all of your peers, maybe that's not why you're getting, \"credit for your strength this quarter\".\n",
      "So as we look into 2025 and having Non-interest Revenue be that bigger contribution to your revenue Compound Annual Growth Rate, maybe walk us through what are the other sort of core fee strengths that we should look for other than FICC and Banking remaining strong and coming back that could bring you to that path to 2026.\n",
      "Mark Mason (CFO): Okay. There's a lot there. But thank you. Thank you for the question.\n",
      "I would like to see the stock reacting much more favorably because this really has been a strong quarter for us and in fact as you mentioned, Net Interest Income when you look through it, we've in fact taken our Net Interest Income guidance up just a tad bit as we referenced that the full year would be slightly down versus modestly down with the fourth quarter that's flat to the third quarter and so that is an important takeaway.\n",
      "I mentioned the headwinds and tailwinds earlier and we shouldn't lose sight of those. We will get lift from reinvesting the securities as those mature, we will continue to see volume growth and those are important drivers of tailwind activity for us.\n",
      "You rightfully mentioned our interest rate exposure analysis that we do on a quarterly basis that reflects the asset sensitivity of our business.\n",
      "And last quarter it was about $1.6 billion or so of a negative, assuming 100 basis point decline across the curve, assuming a static balance sheet and cross-currencies.\n",
      "And as you look at that asset sensitivity, again, you rightfully pointed out that we skew non-US in terms of the magnitude of that decline in Net Interest Income should we see that parallel shift.\n",
      "And in fact, it's as much as $1.3 billion or so of that $1.6 billion is non-US dollar related across 60 currencies.\n",
      "And so you'd have to see all of that move in tandem for that drag and the US dollar drag is about $300 million assuming 100 basis point shift and that's been coming down.\n",
      "If you look back over the quarters, we've been thoughtfully managing that down and that's down to about $300 million number. I would expect when we print the third quarter Q, it will be down a bit more.\n",
      "And so, again, we are asset sensitive but it does skew outside of the US and thank you for asking the question because I think it's important to remind our investors and analysts of that dynamic which in many ways may be different from that of other Institutions.\n",
      "In terms of the late fees, we did say that we were including late fees in our assumptions, in our outlook that we've given.\n",
      "I'll state the obvious Erika, which is that we want people to obviously pay on time and we do everything that we can to assist and ensure that they do that.\n",
      "With that said, we don't have a definitive timeline on late fees, nor are we overly reliant on late fees to drive revenue for our firm.\n",
      "And so it looks like that decisioning will likely kind of fall closer to sometime in 2025 and so there is a small adjustment in the last quarter of our revenue forecast but it's inside of the guidance that we gave and doesn't materially change that in any way.\n",
      "And then the last part of your question, I think, was around Non-interest Revenue and the fee revenue. And as I mentioned earlier, I'm not going to give guidance for 2025 but I think your question was around where are we likely to see continued momentum as it relates to fee revenue growth.\n",
      "And I would start with Services where fees were up some 33% year-over-year and yes we should adjust for the Argentine Peso devaluation. But even if you adjust for that it's double-digit, 11% year-over-year non-interest revenue growth.\n",
      "And when you look at those drivers they've been consistently strong. Cross-border transaction value up 8%, US dollar clearing volume up 7%, commercial card spend up 8%.\n",
      "In the supplement you'll see that it's mid to high single digit year-to-date growth across those KPIs as well. We expect that that will continue with our corporate clients and as we bring on new commercial clients as well.\n",
      "I'll turn you to – if you look at Banking, we talked about already so I won't kind of lean into that too much but except to highlight a really strong quarter in Banking, in Investment Banking fees, in particular, the rebound that we've been talking about but importantly us capturing share in that rebound and these important partnerships that position us well as sponsors start to lean back into the market the investments that we've been making in talent, in sectors we need to strengthen. All of those things are going to play to continued fee momentum as we go into 2025.\n",
      "Wealth, again, really strong performance this quarter with revenues up 9%. But look at the client investment assets, up 24%. The client balances up 14%. That's driving fee momentum and it's a keen area of focus for Andy and that team that he's pulled together and it's a real opportunity for us given the $5 trillion or so of assets that our clients hold away from us and we're better positioning ourselves to capture that.\n",
      "And then finally, you can see kind of continued momentum on U.S. Personal Banking but it's across the board is what I'm saying, Erika, in terms of that fee momentum and it is important.\n",
      "It's an important aspect as we think about getting to those medium term targets and that 4% to 5% revenue.\n",
      "Gerard Cassidy (Analyst): Hi, Mark, hi, Jane.\n",
      "Mark Mason (CFO): Good morning.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 1, Justification: The CFO provides comprehensive and direct answers to each part of the analyst's complex, multi-faceted question. He offers specific figures regarding interest rate sensitivity, clearly addresses the late fee situation and its timeline, and articulates multiple 'other core fee strengths' with supporting metrics, demonstrating a high degree of transparency and specificity.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Vivek Juneja (Analyst): Okay. Thanks on that. And shifting to the asset cap question, Jane and Mark, we didn't hear a clear answer on, A, do you have an asset cap? And B, even if you don't, what is the effective implication or impact of what the regulators have said?\n",
      "Jane Fraser (CEO): So let me be crystal clear. We do not have an asset cap and there are no additional measures other than what was announced in July in place and not expecting any.\n",
      "So the implications of what we're doing is as I've laid out, we've increased investments in the areas where we were behind, particularly in the data related to our regulatory processes and regulatory reporting.\n",
      "We're increasing investment behind it. And we continue to make progress, material progress on the orders in place including closing the Bank Secrecy Act/Anti-Money Laundering order this quarter. The third order closed since 2021.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 1, Justification: The CEO directly and clearly stated that the firm does not have an asset cap, explicitly answering the first part of the question. She then clarified that there are no additional measures beyond prior announcements and detailed the ongoing investments and progress in response to existing regulatory orders, which are direct implications of the regulatory environment rather than an evasion.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Mike Mayo (Analyst): Hi. What assurance can you give that Citi can both meet its 2026 expense guide, the $51 billion to $53 billion and I note the year-to-date run rate implies $54 billion.\n",
      "So getting from that $54 billion run rate down to the $51 billion to $53 billion by 2026 and meet its regulatory targets.\n",
      "In other words, assurance that Citi can both walk and chew gum at the same time.\n",
      "And I guess I'd highlight as you know, on October 2 Senator Warren asked the Office of the Comptroller of the to impose growth restrictions because Citi is \"too big to manage.\"\n",
      "I would assume you don't agree with that, but still the question that a lot of people have is what assurances can you give that an asset cap won't happen at Citigroup? Thanks.\n",
      "Mark Mason (CFO): Thanks, Mike. So why don't I start with your expense question and I'm sure Jane will chime in on some of the other parts of your question.\n",
      "So, look, we put out medium term targets of $51 billion to $53 billion in 2026, revenue dependent, of course, and that's consistent with the target we gave of less than 60% efficiency ratio.\n",
      "And we've got a target this year as you know on the high end of $53.8 billion [ex-Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation special assessment and Civil Money Penalties]. And so we've got to get from $53.8 billion down to $51 billion to $53 billion by 2026.\n",
      "I'm not giving guidance for 2025 but you can expect that that will likely glide down to that number.\n",
      "What's driving the reduction? So we've talked before about $1.5 billion in savings largely related to the restructuring and driving down headcount reduction associated with that.\n",
      "We talked about another $500 million to $1 billion related to expense reductions from eliminating stranded cost as we continue to exit. We're out of nine of these consumer countries already.\n",
      "And we talk about starting to see efficiencies and benefits from the investments and the transformation and technology towards the end of 2026. And those are the three drivers that are important for us to continue to realize between now and 2026.\n",
      "Will there be headwinds? Yes. There will be, the transformation is a multiyear process.\n",
      "We're also investing in risk controls and regulatory spend to support improving our operations. Of course, there will be headwinds but there will also be things that we shift away from.\n",
      "There will be tailwinds associated with it. Jane mentioned some of the productivity efforts that both Andy as well as Vis are pushing on. You look across these businesses and you see positive operating leverage across the board.\n",
      "So that means that Andy Morton as well as Gonzalo are too looking at their cost structures, at expenses that they can take out or productivity that they might improve.\n",
      "And so there will be additional costs that we have to incur. We incurred additional costs this year. But there will also be additional productivity savings that we continue to tease out to ensure that we get to these targets.\n",
      "Jane Fraser (CEO): And, Mike, let me pick up on part of the second part of the question in terms of the progress on the transformation.\n",
      "As you know, and as Mark's talked to you about, the transformation reverses historic underinvestment in Citi's infrastructure. It enhances our risk and control environment. And it's a strategic overhaul as we've talked about that goes well beyond the consent order to simplify and to strengthen Citi to the benefit of all of the stakeholders we have.\n",
      "We are already a very different Citi today. We've made enormous change over the past three years, dramatically simpler business model, significant org change so we align our structure to that model.\n",
      "We now have a flatter organization with greater accountability and as Mark talked about through the investments in our transformation, we're focused on simplifying our operational model, modernizing our infrastructure risk and controls and all of that reduces risk as we go.\n",
      "We're well on the way in executing the transformation plans. We've made meaningful progress as was acknowledged publicly by one of our regulators and it's a wide range book of work.\n",
      "We've made significant strides in areas such as risk management, compliance and accountability and that's well beyond the big bodies of work about consolidating our platforms.\n",
      "So we had 1,250 retired since 2022 as Mark mentioned.\n",
      "Other areas of progress, enhance our stress testing capabilities, they're faster, more frequent, more precise assessments.\n",
      "We put in place new target operating models for wholesale credit risk, enterprise risk, price risk firm wide.\n",
      "A huge body of work reducing risk and high risk processes such as payments and Markets through systemic preventative controls.\n",
      "We've been implementing the XiNG platform, this is the strategic cloud solution for market risk analytics. Values trades on demand and at scale.\n",
      "And we've embedded risk and controls into our performance management framework and tied that to compensation for the full firm. So these are just giving you a flavor of these big body of work that we are executing and getting done.\n",
      "I was very pleased that we closed the Federal Reserve Board, Anti-Money Laundering/Bank Secrecy Act consent order particularly given heightened risk and scrutiny in this area.\n",
      "That is the third consent order we've closed since 2021 and we've been very transparent.\n",
      "Where there are areas in which our execution is delayed against our original timelines as is the case with our data work. We take a step back, determine what we need to change in those areas and get back on track and make relevant tech and people investments.\n",
      "So I feel very confident about the strategy we've laid out for the firm, the deliberate path we're on, the huge progress we've already made, and that we will continue making with determination and with clarity going forward.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 4, Justification: While management provided a detailed explanation of their efforts to improve operations and meet expense targets, they conspicuously avoided directly addressing the analyst's pointed question about assuring that an asset cap would not be imposed. The CEO offered extensive details on their transformation and regulatory progress, which are relevant context, but she did not provide the specific assurance requested, thereby redirecting the answer.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "VIVEK JUNEJA (Analyst): Thank you.\n",
      "MIKE MAYO (Analyst): Hi. Just two clarifications. So, this is a very high-profile amendment to the consent order. And I think what I hear you saying that if you can confirm, your risk compliance and controls are getting passing grade. It's really the data and as it relates to the data, you're talking about 11,000 regulatory reports, some which had 750,000 lines of data. Is that really the scope of what you need to fix? Because people see this externally and say, hey, you're failing in terms of overall controls and resiliency. But I think I hear you saying it's really more about just the data and the regulatory reporting, which is important, but more of a slice of a broader picture. Is that correct?\n",
      "JANE FRASER (CEO): Yeah, Mike, maybe I just – maybe I – you're asking a great and it's an important question, so maybe I try and explain what the data elements because it's an area that Mark and I have pointed to. So, first of all, we use data all over the firm. We use it to deliver 72 million customer statements every month. Our corporate clients, as you heard about at our Services Investor Day, access account data real-time across multiple countries on CitiDirect. And we're moving $5 trillion roughly per day for those clients around the world. We trade billions of dollars in a millisecond on our trading platforms. We can see our liquidity positions real-time around the world. This can only be done if you've got pretty pristine data and highly automated ecosystems.\n",
      "So, but what is the transformation doing? What it is doing is simplifying how data moves through the firm and it's about upgrading the management and governance over those flows. And as I've said, we're doing a strategic overhaul of large parts of our infrastructure, so what are we doing?\n",
      "We're making sure we're capturing data accurately using smart tools and automation. We'll often talk about this smart system, makes sure there's no errors when we book a trade. We've seen our error rate down 85% as a result of it. We're housing our upstream data in two standardized repositories, they're the golden sources, an in-person data hub which you've heard me talk about a few times and they're a golden source now for all of the downstream data use, populating the thousands of regulatory reports Mark talked about and other areas. And what a single repository means is that the data models, the data quality rules, the controls you put in place that govern and manage that data, they all sit in one place rather than being distributed all over the firm as they have been historically.\n",
      "Mark's been investing in building a standardized reporting infrastructure. You've heard us talk about a single full suite reporting ledger versus the six or so reporting ledgers that we had in the past. And we're delivering all of this through consolidated systems, through the automation and streamlining of data flows, so instead of being in multiple pipes, the flows go through single pipes. So, it's a, sorry to get a bit plumber on you for a moment, but I think it is important to understand what it is because it's a lot of work. It's a strategic overhaul. It's not a series of tactical fixes.\n",
      "Where we're behind, as we do the work on data, we identify specific issues we need to fix as we execute the plan that we have in place. There's some more areas to address than we knew back when we did the plan and we've also accelerated the work on improving the accuracy of our regulatory reports and we increased the scope of this work as well. It's more comprehensive than originally planned.\n",
      "So, what we're doing, we're adding resources and data experts. We're learning from best practices and we're using some great Artificial Intelligence and other data tools that are helping to identify anomalies in data and data flows much more quickly. We're also, to some of the culture side, we're learning from pilots how do we accelerate broader deployment at scale across the firm in a consistent enterprise-wide manner. So, all of these things in the data side are going to enable us to leapfrog competitors, more revenue opportunities, better client service, fewer buffers, drive more efficiencies and hope at the end – the end goal here is it becomes a competitive advantage for the firm. That is the data plan.\n",
      "Clearly, there's a very important element of it related to the consent orders. We're behind in a few areas. We're investing. We've already begun that investment, as Mark and I've talked about, to get it done. We'll get it done.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 4, Justification: The CEO provides an extensive and detailed explanation of the firm's data strategy and transformation efforts, which are the core of the analyst's question regarding the scope of the fix. However, she avoids a direct 'yes' or 'no' confirmation to the analyst's specific framing of whether the issues are *only* about data and regulatory reporting, or if they encompass broader controls and resiliency. The response redirects by elaborating on actions rather than directly validating the analyst's interpretation of the scope's limitation.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Matt O'Connor (Analyst): Okay. I think that means by the end of 2025, you talk about 1Q 2026, that was kind of my clarification question on that. I thought you needed four quarters after you legally separated it to officially IPO it.\n",
      "Jane Fraser (CEO): We believe as we stand at the moment we would be ready to IPO at the end of 2025.\n",
      "It's much more a focus on what the market conditions at that point will be and Mark and I are very, very much focused on the shareholder value and maximizing that over – rushing over one quarter versus another quarter.\n",
      "Mark Mason (CFO): And there's no hard rule on – sorry, go ahead.\n",
      "Jane Fraser (CEO): Yes, there isn't a hard rule on you have to have got four quarters after you have separated.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 1, Justification: The management directly addresses the analyst's clarification regarding the IPO timeline, stating they expect to be ready by the end of 2025. Crucially, they explicitly deny the existence of a 'hard rule' requiring four quarters after separation, directly answering the core part of the analyst's question.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Vivek Juneja (Analyst): Hi. Two questions, Jane and Mark. One is on expenses and the other is on your response to the asset cap question before. So first one, expenses, an easier one. Earlier in the year you had said you expect about $700 million to $1 billion of severance charges in the $53.5 billion to $53.8 billion. Did you have any in the third quarter? Expect any if the fourth? And do you expect to be done with those this year or any to continue into next year too?\n",
      "Mark Mason (CFO): Yeah. So that number was a combination of restructuring charges and severance charges or repositioning charges and we breakout obviously restructuring so that you can see those.\n",
      "And this restructuring component was largely driven by the org simplification. That will be done this year.\n",
      "The normal severance or repositioning charges that we take as a normal course of BAU you would expect that to occur in any year and it certainly will be part of 2025 and 2026 going forward.\n",
      "We did have some this quarter. I would expect that we will have some next quarter, but I don't see us being outside of by any stretch the range that I gave and again the range was for the combination of both.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 1, Justification: The CFO directly answered whether the company had severance charges in Q3 and expected them in Q4. He also fully addressed the question about the charges continuing into next year by clarifying that restructuring-related charges would be done this year, while normal severance charges would continue into 2025 and 2026.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Mike Mayo (Analyst): Hi. Thanks for the clarification on the asset cap question that I asked earlier. And I know you are limited in how much you can say about regulators but just be clear, because a lot of e-mail traffic going back, you did say there is no asset cap and you don't expect one and you don't expect other additional actions at this time?\n",
      "Jane Fraser (CEO): Correct.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 1, Justification: The CEO's one-word answer \"Correct\" directly confirms all components of the analyst's multi-part question, including the asset cap and the expectation of no further actions. Despite acknowledging limitations on discussing regulators, the response is clear, specific, and fully addresses the query without any vagueness or redirection.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Matt O'Connor (Analyst): I see. Okay. That's super helpful. We just haven't had that many of these, so that's helpful.\n",
      "And then just separately I think in the prepared remarks you guys mentioned a modest provision within Services for some of the unremitted corporate dividends and I just wanted to clarify that and what country is that. And I guess I thought there wasn't really much liability to you guys from that, so any clarification on that. I know it's a small amount, but that would be helpful. Thank you.\n",
      "Mark Mason (CFO): Sure. It's a small amount. In the back of the deck, we have a page on Russia exposure. It's related to that.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 4, Justification: The CFO indirectly answers the country question by referencing 'Russia exposure' but completely avoids clarifying the nature or reason for the liability, which was a specific part of the analyst's question regarding their prior understanding. Instead of explaining the liability, they merely state it's a 'small amount' and direct the analyst to 'the back of the deck,' which is a redirection rather than a direct, comprehensive explanation.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "SAUL MARTINEZ (Analyst): Hi. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Just, I guess I just want to follow up on the latter question. I just want to be very clear. So, what you're saying is that the requirement that CBNA receive a non-objection before dividending upstream to the parent, that does not impact how you think about your capital flexibility, how you think about – it doesn't restrict you in any way and shouldn't impact, for example, your ability to benefit from, for example, a Basel Endgame rule that is softened or some of the benefits, Mark, that you talked about in terms of simplification. So, you don't see this impacting your ongoing level of capital flexibility and your ability to repurchase stock going forward if some of these things actually do play out?\n",
      "MARK MASON (CFO): No.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 1, Justification: The CFO's single-word 'No' directly answers the analyst's multi-part question, which was framed to confirm a premise of non-impact. While extremely terse and lacking elaboration, it provides a clear and specific denial of any perceived impact on capital flexibility and share repurchases, thus directly addressing the core of the question.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Jim Mitchell (Analyst): Hey, good morning. Mark, consensus expectations, and it's just another expense question in a different way. But consensus has you not hitting your revenue growth targets and you're certainly free to disagree and I think that's fine. But they also have your expenses at the high end of your $51 billion to $53 billion range in 2026. I guess, does that make sense or do you feel confident that if revenues do sort of disappoint your targets that you could come in at the – you should or can come in at the lower end of that range to help get to your Return on Average Tangible Common Equity target.\n",
      "Mark Mason (CFO): Yeah. So, let's take it in pieces. So I think – the first thing is that, I think Jane and I have been very consistent with trying to give guidance on full year performance for the past couple years and we've largely actually delivered on that guidance.\n",
      "If you look at the top line growth since Investor Day, it's largely consistent with what we talked about in the medium term. If you look at the expense guidance that we've given, largely consistent with that including this year.\n",
      "Even as I look at the $80 billion to $81 billion revenue guidance we gave for the year, and you look at the $60.6 billion that we've done year-to-date, and you think about what we have to deliver in order to hit that target, that is achievable particularly when you remember that we had a large Argentina devaluation last year.\n",
      "That fee momentum required in the fourth quarter is very achievable and we believe that we will obviously hit the high end of the [expense] range for 2024.\n",
      "As I think about that outer year period and the guidance that we gave there, look, you all want proof points before you actually believe that we can deliver on that medium term target. I'm pointing you to proof points.\n",
      "I'm hopeful that as you see those proof points through 2024, full year and each of the quarters, that you will start to believe in that revenue momentum that's required in the medium term.\n",
      "The fee revenue is a very good indicator. What we delivered this year and this quarter is a very good indicator of the momentum we should see across these businesses in the next couple years.\n",
      "I also hope that you would then see that as we deliver on the expense target that we have a path to continuing to deliver on the medium-term expense target, the drivers of which I mentioned earlier.\n",
      "Yes, if revenues come in short of the target that we've set for ourselves, you would naturally expect for the volume and transaction related expenses and compensation expenses to come down in a commensurate way with that revenue decline and you would also expect that we would look to see if there are other productivity opportunities that we can tease out in order to still deliver on that operating efficiency target that we've set for ourselves.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 3, Justification: The CFO initially deflects by emphasizing the company's confidence in meeting revenue targets and past performance, avoiding the 'what if' scenario posed by the analyst. However, in the final paragraph, the CFO directly addresses the core question, stating that variable expenses would naturally decrease and productivity opportunities would be sought if revenues came in short of targets. The significant initial deflection before the eventual direct, though not highly specific, answer makes the overall response fall into the neutral category.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Saul Martinez (Analyst): Okay. Fair enough. And then I guess a follow-up on the US Personal Banking, Return on Average Tangible Common Equity improvement and the normalization of the cost of credit seems to be a big component of that. But Mark can you just remind us where you are in terms of cost of credit versus what you would think a more normalized level is for Branded Cards and Retail Services. I guess how much of a tailwind does a more normalized credit environment entail in terms of credit cost?\n",
      "Mark Mason (CFO): Again, I don't want to get into 2025 at this stage. I assure you, we will give more color and commentary on that as we get into the fourth quarter earnings in January.\n",
      "What I will say again, as you think about these businesses, we do see continued top line – we do expect continued top line momentum.\n",
      "We've had eight consecutive quarters of positive operating leverage in U.S. Personal Banking, 49% [efficiency ratio] this quarter. So we're managing the expense base well. We think there's more upside to the top line.\n",
      "We're very focused on growth across the portfolios and I do think that cost of credit again, if for no other reason but the compounding effect of those vintages maturing as well as kind of inflation starting to come off, rates trickling down, that should be better for the consumer and should start to play out in both the macroeconomic scenarios that we run for Current Expected Credit Losses purposes but also ultimately in delinquencies and Net Credit Losses and we're starting to see that improvement in delinquencies and its stabilization already somewhat.\n",
      "So I don't want to get into guidance. But that's kind of how I think about the drivers or contributors to improve returns over the medium term.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 4, Justification: The CFO explicitly stated they did not want to provide guidance for 2025 or get into specific numbers regarding the 'normalized level' or 'tailwind' from credit costs. While they discussed general drivers influencing credit costs, they clearly avoided the quantitative aspect of the question.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Vivek Juneja (Analyst): Okay. Great. Thank you.\n",
      "Matt O'Connor (Analyst): Hi. Just a couple of clarification questions. I guess first on Banamex, are you on track to still IPO it the fourth quarter of next year or does it just get pushed out by a quarter with the legal separation taking a little bit longer?\n",
      "Jane Fraser (CEO): Look, I think as I mentioned in response to Erika's question, we plan to be ready to IPO at the end of 2025 based on the factors we can control.\n",
      "The timing is going to get driven by how we maximize shareholder value and that will be market conditions. So that's where we stand.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 4, Justification: The CEO states they plan to be \"ready to IPO at the end of 2025,\" which aligns with the analyst's Q4 timeframe. However, the answer immediately shifts the ultimate IPO timing decision to external \"market conditions\" and maximizing \"shareholder value,\" rather than directly confirming if they are indeed on track for that specific date given the legal separation progress or if it will be pushed out. This avoids a direct commitment to the specific IPO timeline asked.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "MIKE MAYO (Analyst): Hi, just a clarification. So you are guiding for three consecutive years of lower expenses including that $600 million repositioning this year. So they were down in 2024, you're guiding them lower in 2025 and you guide them lower in 2026 again, and you're also guiding for three consecutive years of higher revenues based on what you said. I didn't see that in the written materials, but I think I heard you say that, Mark. So three years of lower expenses, three years of higher revenues to at least 2026. Is that correct?\n",
      "MARK MASON (CFO): Yes, that is correct. I think you described it correctly. We're seeing continued momentum on the top line. and we're focused on continuing to bring our expenses down just as we did in 2024, a tad bit in 2025 and then more in 2026.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 1, Justification: The CFO directly confirms the analyst's summary regarding three consecutive years of lower expenses and higher revenues. He explicitly states, \"Yes, that is correct. I think you described it correctly,\" directly addressing both parts of the question without any vagueness or redirection.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Ryan Kenny (Analyst): Thank you.\n",
      "Saul Martinez (Analyst): Hey, guys. Couple quick questions. First, just a follow-up on Banamex. Jane, as you know, there are concerns about judicial reform in Mexico and the implications for rule of law and Mexican asset prices have suffered as a result. I think the largest Mexican bank trades at something in the neighborhood of seven times earnings. If market conditions don't improve and Mexican asset prices remain depressed and these concerns persist, then what? I mean, do you just wait until market conditions improve or how do you think about this process in the context of what seems to be a deteriorating macro backdrop for Mexico.\n",
      "Jane Fraser (CEO): Yeah. We've got to wait and see what the market conditions will be but the North Star for me and for Mark is crystal clear, it is optimizing and maximizing our shareholder value.\n",
      "So if the conditions are not appropriate at that time then we will wait until they are.\n",
      "In the meantime, the business is performing well. It's accretive to our returns. It's not a drag here in any shape or form so there is no need to rush for a suboptimal result here.\n",
      "But we will IPO and we will exit Banamex, but we won't do that in a reckless manner.\n",
      "We will be disciplined about it as you would expect us to be and as I think we're demonstrating that we are on multiple different dimensions.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 2, Justification: The CEO directly addresses the 'do you just wait' part of the question by stating they will wait if conditions are not appropriate. She also clearly articulates the 'North Star' of maximizing shareholder value and being disciplined, which explains how they think about the process in a difficult environment, even if specific alternative scenarios are not detailed beyond waiting.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Ryan Kenny (Analyst): Hey. Thanks for taking my question. I have one for Mark. So you mentioned that Services Net Interest Income is a tailwind as rates decline. Can you just unpack how that happens? Is there any benefit from swap roll-off or a floating swap that we should be thinking about that's embedded in that statement?\n",
      "Mark Mason (CFO): There are a couple of things kind of to keep in mind on the Services business. So, one is, is obviously this is a client business. It's not just a deposit taking business and so how we think about pricing to those client becomes really important.\n",
      "You've got the US and non-US dynamic that's playing through. For institutional clients, we've largely been holding to the higher betas that we saw as rates have ticked up. Again, with the relationship in mind.\n",
      "And we have some offsetting pressure outside of the US as those betas kind of catch up.\n",
      "But I think importantly you also heard me mention the reinvestment into securities at higher yields and that reinvestment or those higher yields ultimately play out through the businesses and so that will show up as part of kind of Net Interest Income as we think about Services but the other businesses as well.\n",
      "And so those are important components of the Net Interest Income story for Services.\n",
      "I think when you look at the in-quarter performance and [Treasury and Trade Solutions] Net Interest Income is down 5%, a big part of that is driven by the Argentina rates movement in the quarter versus last year, so lower rates we're earning in Argentina playing through that line particularly in this quarter.\n",
      "If you adjusted for that on the Net Interest Income line, it would be flat to slightly a little bit better.\n",
      "So that's really what it is. It's kind of management of client relationships as well as the higher earnings on reinvested securities contributing to that as well as volume from operating account growth that we expect.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 4, Justification: The answer avoids directly explaining how Services Net Interest Income acts as a tailwind specifically as rates decline, and it completely sidesteps the analyst's specific question about any benefit from swap roll-off or floating swaps. The CFO offers general points about client relationships and reinvestment at higher yields (which doesn't clearly explain a benefit from *declining* rates) and diverts by discussing the impact of Argentina rates on current quarter performance, rather than the forward-looking tailwind mechanism.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Mike Mayo (Analyst): And then last follow-up. To the extent that you see a disconnect between your performance and the stock price that would seem to create more of an opportunity to buy the stock at $64 when tangible book value is $90. And so, I hope that – I've used this analogy before, but hopefully you're selling the chairs and the desk and the silverware in the executive dining room to go ahead and buy back stock whenever you can.\n",
      "Jane Fraser (CEO): It's clearly given where we are trading, we're very focused around the opportunities to buy back stock and mindful of the importance of it and equally, yes, we are proud of the performance of the franchise this quarter.\n",
      "It was a very strong quarter and important set of proof points for our investors. We are on a deliberate path.\n",
      "We're making the progress that we need to and actually pretty excited about the path ahead of us and the potential that we see.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 4, Justification: The CEO acknowledges the focus and importance of stock buybacks but avoids directly addressing the analyst's pointed suggestion about the extreme extent to which they should pursue them. Instead of committing to an aggressive strategy, she pivots to discussing the company's recent strong performance and future path, redirecting from the core of the question.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "EBRAHIM POONAWALA (Analyst): I guess maybe, Jane, I wanted to follow up on a couple of segments. I think you said 2024 turning point for Wealth, and we've seen very steady progress on the Return on Average Tangible Common Equity in Wealth. Just talk to us in terms of, Andy Sieg’s being in the seat for a year now, you've seen progress. What needs to happen? Just talk to us a little bit about the franchise positioning competitively both in the U.S. and abroad as you think about going head-to-head with some of your global competitors and where are the most likely growth opportunities over the next year or two?\n",
      "JANE FRASER (CEO): Yes. So, our vision, my vision is that we become a global leader in wealth management. There are not many firms that have the globality of Citi. We have all the assets, especially the client relationships all around the world, which were just not tapped for investments in the past. It's a big opportunity. We have $5.3 trillion “off us” from existing clients. And I think the fact that I would find interesting is 55% of it, it's almost $3 trillion with affluent clients in our branch network in America, in the U.S.\n",
      "We're also very well-positioned to capture new wealth, just think about what Citi does in terms of our footprint, our capabilities really supports the wealth creation, from the Commercial Bank, our Investment Banking side, Markets, obviously, Services supporting it, too. These are all great feeders for us to strengthen wealth relationships with our clients.\n",
      "So we brought in Andy. Andy greatly sharpened the focus on the investment business, this is where we see the big upside. He's been building a differentiated value proposition around wealth creation. He’s been leveraging a lot of the leading capital market capabilities, the different relationships we have with PE firms, asset managers around the world. Get a great platform in place and importantly, improving our client experience, again, particularly around investments, asset allocation, performance, et cetera.\n",
      "What I have also got to love is the surgical approach that he's taking to the expense base and driving productivity, something that we're doing across the firm. I'm also excited by the talent he's bringing, in the market leaders like Kate Moore and Keith Glenfield in the investment space. And we've made a lot of investments in training and building this investment culture that we didn't have before.\n",
      "So to your point, the proof points are working. Q4 revenue up 20%, operating margin at 21% on its way to 25% to 30%, 10% Return on Average Tangible Common Equity on its way to 15% to 20%. These last few quarters, you've just seen us on that march. And the number I'm most excited by, net new investment asset inflow of $42 billion, up 40% year-over-year. The strategy is working. We're going to be a leader in wealth, the growth opportunities, Asia U.S., Middle East, all the places where we are with our existing clients and the new wealth generators of the future.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 1, Justification: The CEO provides a very direct and comprehensive answer, addressing all parts of the analyst's multi-faceted question. She outlines specific strategic initiatives (\"what needs to happen\"), highlights Citi's competitive advantage in \"globality,\" and explicitly names key regions (Asia, U.S., Middle East) as growth opportunities.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Erika Najarian (Analyst): Hi. I think we've slid over to the afternoon. Good afternoon, guys. The first one is for you, Jane. As I speak with longer term investors, they often offer the commentary that clearly the path from the 7% Return on Average Tangible Common Equity this quarter to the 11% to 12% hopefully will be bridged and to be able to initiate a position before that progress is made, they really sort of want to see more capital optimization. And this question is not really the same question I ask you about buybacks every quarter but really maybe a progress update on Banamex. So there is chatter in the market about Banamex needed to have four quarters of separate financials before being IPOed and I'm wondering if you could give us specific progress on how that's going? And Mark, maybe remind us on what Banamex's contribution is as we think about the unlocking that excess capital versus taking it out of the P&L.\n",
      "Jane Fraser (CEO): Yeah. I'd be delighted to, Erika. And I would also just before I jump into Banamex point to a laser focus on capital optimization.\n",
      "It's been a mantra for a long time in our Markets business, in Banking and a discipline that we've driven throughout the organization and I would say there isn't anyone at Citi that is not keenly aware of the focus around optimizing our capital.\n",
      "Returning to shareholders, particularly given where we're trading, and making sure that we drive to returns.\n",
      "So if I turn to Banamex, our singular focus right now is the separation of the two banks which we expect to complete in the fourth quarter of this year.\n",
      "This has been an enormous body of work because we are creating effectively de novo Mexico's eighth largest bank.\n",
      "We've just now gotten the core regulatory authorizations that we need to proceed with separation. Although there are a few other approvals pending.\n",
      "We are in the very final stages and are working with our clients to prepare them for this switchover later on in Q4.\n",
      "Once the separation is complete, we will turn our full attention to the IPO itself and the successful execution of the IPO is the highest priority for our Head of International, Ernesto Torres Cantú, to run Banamex. And our incoming Banamex Executive Chairman who starts this quarter, Ignacio Deschamps.\n",
      "We plan to be ready to IPO at the end of 2025 based on the factors that we can control but I think as Mark and I have always said, the timing is going to be driven by market conditions to ensure we maximize the shareholder value.\n",
      "And we're making the necessary investments to continue growing share and I was very pleased that Banamex outpaced the average market revenue growth year-to-date, good expense discipline being maintained despite the complex separation process and the environment.\n",
      "So I'm pleased with where we are and I hope that gives you a bit of a flavor of what the path ahead looks like.\n",
      "Mark Mason (CFO): Yeah. In terms of the second part of your question, a couple things. So, one, we've been seeing good growth in our Mexico Consumer business.\n",
      "We've also been investing in it appropriately so to make sure that we protect the strength of that franchise as we prepare it for separation, ultimately for the IPO.\n",
      "Erika, if I understood your question right, if we turn to page 16 of the deck in the bottom right hand side, we show the P&L for Mexico Consumer for 2022 and 2023. And so you can see the contribution from a revenue and expense point of view so about $1.5 billion in 2023.\n",
      "And I think it's about $4 billion or so of Tangible Common Equity that we have associated with this business. So that gives you some sense for the contribution, but it continues to perform quite well as we manage it through this process.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 4, Justification: While the CFO provided clear and specific financial contributions for Banamex, the CEO avoided directly addressing the analyst's specific question about the market chatter regarding 'four quarters of separate financials' needed before Banamex could be IPOed. Instead of confirming or denying this requirement, the CEO offered a general timeline for IPO readiness, which constitutes a redirect and evasion on a key detail.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Matt O'Connor (Analyst): Okay. But still feel like there's not risk to you guys from all those kind of trapped dividends, I guess why take a small reserve if there's legally no risk to you guys?\n",
      "Mark Mason (CFO): Well, it's the way we treat the exposure there. We're following the guidelines on how we need to treat exposures in the country that we aren't able to distribute to clients but we actually have to hold on their behalf.\n",
      "And so we have to book a reserve associated with that and so we do that. We obviously show on the page what the exposure is in the event of a loss of control and you can kind of see how that ultimately nets out but we're following the appropriate guidelines for what's required for reserves of that nature.\n",
      "Matt O'Connor (Analyst): Got it. Okay. Thank you.\n",
      "Mark Mason (CFO): Yeah.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 3, Justification: The CFO explains that the reserve is taken due to following guidelines for specific exposures where the bank holds client funds. While this addresses the 'why take a reserve' part, it does not directly clarify or reconcile the analyst's premise about 'legally no risk to you guys,' leaving some ambiguity regarding the nature of the risk being reserved against from the bank's perspective.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "JOHN MCDONALD (Analyst): Thank you. Mark, just wanted to follow up on your answer to Jim right there. So when you look at the 10% to 11% Return on Average Tangible Common Equity target for 2026. Is that kind of assuming you'll be around the target or like using the 13.1% as the target? And then longer term, you hope to bring that target down as rules get clarified and the franchise gets simplified?\n",
      "MARK MASON (CFO): Hey John, good to hear from you. In fact, yes, the 10% to 11% Return on Average Tangible Common Equity target we've set for 2026 does assume that we are running and using a 13.1% Common Equity Tier 1 ratio obviously, there'll be an SCB that comes out sometime later this year. The rules are continuing to evolve and what have you, and we'll factor those in as we know more about them. But yes, it does assume the 13.1% which is our management target, if you will, for Common Equity Tier 1.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 2, Justification: The CFO directly confirms the assumption about the 13.1% Common Equity Tier 1 ratio. Regarding the longer-term target reduction, the CFO explains that rules are evolving and they will factor them in, directly addressing the analyst's contingency about \"rules get clarified\" without being able to commit to a specific future target reduction.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "MIKE MAYO (Analyst): All right. And then I guess this is for Jane. Well, that beats haggis on toast, if you achieve that. But I'm wondering why that efficiency might not improve even more. I mean if you have $5 billion of stranded costs and Transformation costs in 2024 and some of that goes down. I heard you're investing in tech and Transformation and volume and the businesses. And there's always a trade-off between the bottom line results you showed today and the growth you show in the future, and it seems like you're going to get this done, the lower expenses while you're leaning into a little bit extra growth. So talk about that trade-off and where you're leaning in for growth a little bit more.\n",
      "JANE FRASER (CEO): First of all, I'm a little disturbed by your comment about haggis on toast. It's haggis with mashed potatoes and whiskey, just to be clear for everyone. It's Robert Burns night coming up soon.\n",
      "On expenses, Mike and everyone, expenses are a focus not just for Mark and I, but for the entire management team. We're making sure that focus and discipline is really getting installed and instilled into the DNA of Citi. And you've seen that, as you referenced, we've been meeting our expense guidance over the last couple of years, we've been driving positive operating efficiency.\n",
      "We're all very focused on improving our operating expense base. Consolidating technology, the simplification work, automation, getting different utilities put in place rather than fragmented around the firm, using Artificial Intelligence tools now our, location strategy, right? So that core operating expense base is something that we're really looking at how do we drive to be more efficient, more modern and getting it to the level it should be for the revenues that we generate.\n",
      "We all want Transformation to get done quickly, and we want it to get done right. So that is why our expenses are temporarily elevated to make the investments that needed there. This is not all run rate.\n",
      "And as you say, as CEO, I will not sacrifice the right long-term investments in our growth and competitiveness for short-term expediency. This is a way point. It's not a destination. And we know what we need to do. We've got our arms around all of this, we're just getting on with execution.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 3, Justification: The CEO acknowledges the focus on expenses and the concept of trade-offs, but her response remains high-level. She doesn't directly address why efficiency might not improve 'even more' despite the $5 billion in costs, nor does she provide specific details on where they are 'leaning in for growth.' The answer is somewhat generic and focuses on their overall strategy rather than the nuanced details of the analyst's question.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "JIM MITCHELL (Analyst): Okay. Great. That's very helpful. And then just maybe pivoting to the buyback, great to see the $20 billion authorization. Obviously, I can't help but ask about beyond 1Q. If we do sort of get this more certainty maybe no increase in capital requirements, does that start to help you maybe at least temporarily lower the buffer to take advantage of, you’re trading below tangible book and getting the accretion and accelerating the buyback? Or how do you think about the rest of the year on the buybacks?\n",
      "MARK MASON (CFO): Look, I'll make a couple of comments. So one, we're very pleased to have announced the buyback program at $20 billion. I think, in many ways, that is a demonstration, if you will, of continued confidence in the earnings generation and momentum that we have around that as well as the recognition that we are trading below book and not where we want to be. And you've heard both Jane and I speak to the importance of increasing and doing more in the way of buybacks.\n",
      "We've increased that to $1.5 billion. I think that supports that same degree of confidence that we have in the momentum. We are constantly looking at every year on an annual basis as we go through our planning process at the management buffer that we have of 100 basis points.\n",
      "And despite the last couple of quarters at running above the 13.1%, our target is the 13.1%. And so as we go through the balance of the year, as we get clarity on reg rules and what have you, you'll see us continue to manage down to that 13.1% and obviously, the two important characteristics that we keep in mind is the opportunity to invest more in the business at accretive returns, and where we're trading and the need to do more buybacks in order to reflect the underlying value. So target is 13.1%. We continue to look at that management buffer as the regulatory environment evolves. And we'll continue to do more in the way of capital actions as that makes sense.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 2, Justification: The CFO directly addresses the core of the question by stating they will 'manage down to that 13.1%' capital target 'as we get clarity on reg rules,' which links future buyback actions to the regulatory environment as queried by the analyst. While not providing a specific buyback amount or timeline, the response clearly outlines their strategy and conditions for accelerating buybacks for the rest of the year. There is some minor vagueness on the 'acceleration' specifics beyond Q1 but the conditions for it are clearly stated.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "BETSY GRASECK (Analyst): Hi good morning. Jane, just to follow up on what you mentioned, as you do execute, we all expect, or at least I do, that the market will be giving you credit for that execution, and meaning multiples should increase. I have a few questions here on the buyback, because right now, today, as we all know, you're trading below book, it has got to be, buying back stock has got to be the most accretive use of capital today.\n",
      "And why wait on the buyback when you can lean into it today and keep your 2026 guide, I mean, the old guide was 11% to 12% Return on Average Tangible Common Equity, new guide, 10% to 11%.\n",
      "I'm kind of confused why you don't pull that lever more aggressively because buying back the stock, the accretion to tangible book, it’s got to be the easiest thing to do to help that Return on Average Tangible Common Equity go up. When you compare and contrast against all the hard work you've been doing, which will obviously be very important to getting the Return on Average Tangible Common Equity up. But why not lean more into that buyback? And can you give us a sense of the timing of that $20 billion? Thank you.\n",
      "JANE FRASER (CEO): Yes, Betsy, I love the passion. I've got to say I can hear the determination in your voice. I think it's the same determination we feel. Look, we're very committed to returning capital shareholders period. Full stop. We’ve got a $20 billion buyback program, as Mark said, that is reflective of the growing earnings power that we have and our confidence in the path ahead. We've been increasing the amount of capital return over the last few quarters. I'm also happy to see a more aggressive Basel III scenario firmly off the table.\n",
      "We have, nonetheless, a 13.1% Common Equity Tier 1 ratio that we put in the plan that can change over time as well. But there's not, there's not complete certainty around where the capital requirements are going to go. We hope there will be a holistic one that is reflective of the risk profile of the bank that's been improving significantly over the last few years.\n",
      "So we have some great growth opportunities. I look at the different areas. I'm excited by what we see in Wealth. We've got a great runway with our clients who want to do business with us in Banking.\n",
      "We've got some very important investments and an investment agenda that we're putting in to help us continue growing the bank, gaining competitiveness in a responsible way. I'll just conclude with exactly your point. The bar is high on those investments. We don't make them unless we see extremely attractive marginal Return on Average Tangible Common Equity. And there's a lot of things we say no to in order to put the $20 billion program in place.\n",
      "In terms of timing, like our peers, we're not committing to a particular time frame from this, but you can see our commitment. You can hear our commitment.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 4, Justification: The CEO largely avoids directly answering why the company is not leaning more aggressively into the buyback now, given its accretive nature and trading below book value. Instead, the response pivots to general commitments, regulatory uncertainty, and other growth investment priorities. Furthermore, the explicit refusal to provide a timeline for the $20 billion buyback directly avoids that part of the question.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Jim Mitchell (Analyst): Sure. No, I appreciate that color. And then maybe for Mark, I mean, you highlighted at least on a period-end basis, deposit growth and commercial loan growth looked pretty good on a period-end basis quarter-over-quarter. So, I guess when we think about the Net Interest Income assumptions, deposit and loan growth looks good, but anything different given the strong start to the Net Interest Income ex-Markets story and seemingly some good momentum in deposit and loan growth. Do you feel good, better, worse on sort of your Net Interest Income outlook for this year?\n",
      "Mark Mason (CFO): Yes. Thanks, Jim. Look, I continue to feel good about the Net Interest Income outlook. There's obviously uncertainty that Jane has referenced, but that 2% to 3% ex-Markets. We've talked in the past about what the tailwinds and headwinds are. And you referenced, we saw some of that play through in the quarter in terms of deposit volumes. We saw a good operating momentum in our Services business in Treasury and Trade Solutions in particular.\n",
      "The loan growth saw not just in average interest-earning balances on the Branded Cards side, but also saw trade loan growth as well. And so those are going to be important tailwinds as I think about the balance of the quarter.\n",
      "You've heard me reference as well, reinvestment from maturing securities in our investment portfolio into higher-yielding assets, including cash, and you can see that on the balance sheet that some of that started to take place as well in helping deposit spreads.\n",
      "And then the team has been very, very engaged as it relates to deposit repricing and managing beta through the current environment. So, the combination of those things, along with the removal of the reduction of late fees are really tailwinds that contribute to that 2% to 3% growth, and then there's some headwinds. So lower rates on floating rate assets would be a [headwind]. The potential of Foreign Exchange translation, primarily in Mexico would be a [headwind], but net-net, I feel good about the 2% to 3% growth in Net Interest Income ex-Markets.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 1, Justification: The CFO directly answers the question about his feelings on the Net Interest Income outlook, stating he \"continue[s] to feel good.\" He then provides specific factors (tailwinds and headwinds) that support the company's previously stated NII growth guidance, fully addressing the underlying concerns about growth momentum.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Mike Mayo (Analyst): Okay. Thank you for clarifying that. And I guess, look, I have great respect, I'm an ex-regulator, Paul Volcker was my hero. I respect regulators.\n",
      "And nobody wants to see you cut corners to get to your $51 billion to $53 billion of expenses.\n",
      "But I'm just wondering – and you have consolidated systems apps, layers, bureaucracy and you're divesting lots of activities.\n",
      "So it's just even the amended consent order was surprising because you have taken so many efforts and if you should have had an amended consent order or other actions, they probably should have been in place one, five, 10 or literally 20 years ago. And so that's just confusing on the outside.\n",
      "So with that said, is this a matter of spending more money or about doing these tasks more intelligently?\n",
      "In other words, you put more gas in the tank, the car's not going faster. So is it amount of resources or just being more intelligent in terms of resolving some of these regulatory issues?\n",
      "Jane Fraser (CEO): So let me break it down to a couple of pieces. So I start off just remind everyone the consent orders are very, very broad and the action that was taken was because we're behind in a narrower area which is the data particularly regarding our regulatory reporting where we're behind is the main area of focus.\n",
      "We moved swiftly to address it. We're very transparent about it from early on in the year that we were falling behind on this and overall I'm pleased with our progress.\n",
      "And as you say, Mike, I listed a number of areas of progress and trying to make it as tangible as we can, given what we can and can't say as this is supervisory.\n",
      "I'm pleased that our businesses continue to improve their performance while the transformation is going on. They're the two priorities we have this year so I think effectively, yes, we can walk and chew gum at the same time and the huge benefit of all of the simplification on the business, on the organization, the other efforts, is making it easier for us to execute and be very focused.\n",
      "And well maybe, Mark, I’ll pass it over to you.\n",
      "Mark Mason (CFO): I think your question's helpful in the sense that you said is it kind of a rethink on our approach or is it the need to spend more money and one of the things that we've done, Mike, is take a step back and look at how we've been approaching data, for example.\n",
      "So this is – and we are going to make – we have made some changes to our approach and those changes relate to how we get after resolving data issues that are identified ensuring that there's engagement from the front end business, from the functions that are most relevant and that there's consideration for what's required on reg reporting in order for us to get that process streamlined and correct.\n",
      "And so there are aspects of this that require a change in our approach and we've been taking that change, making that change rather, and we'll make more changes accordingly as we've taken that step back and there are aspects of it that require at a minimum review of what is causing either the delay or us not moving at the pace that we would like to move or that our regulators would like.\n",
      "And that is in fact what the resource review plan was that was in the amended consent order. It was basically a statement saying that you need to ensure that you have sufficient resources and that they're allocated towards achieving the timely and sustainable compliance.\n",
      "And so part of our process is in fact that. Taking a regular review of what is on track in the way of our milestones and deliverables where we see things that are being delayed or going red, what is the underlying root cause for why.\n",
      "Is it a resource issue where we need to put more dollars and people or technology to it? Is it a process issue where we need to reconsider our approach? And on the other side of that root cause, taking action to fix it.\n",
      "And so your question is spot-on. The answer is that in many instances it will be a little bit of both, but importantly our processes include that type of analysis and assessment so that we can get after the execution on this in an effective way. I hope that helps.\n",
      "Jane Fraser (CEO): And all of this drives productivity and other benefits for our shareholders as well as making sure that we're strengthening Citi from the regulatory perspective.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 1, Justification: The CFO directly addresses the analyst's 'money or intelligence' question by stating 'in many instances it will be a little bit of both.' He then provides a clear and specific explanation of how they assess and act on both resource and process issues through their internal review mechanisms. The answer is highly specific and fully addresses the core of the analyst's inquiry.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "JIM MITCHELL (Analyst): Hey, good morning everyone. Just I think as Jane noted, it seems like a material driver of the reduction in the Return on Average Tangible Common Equity target in 2026 is expenses. I think you kind of backed off the lower end of that, given higher investments in the Transformation but also talked about it being somewhat temporary. We appreciate the below $53 billion for 2026, but how much more is there to go beyond that in terms of eliminating parallel systems, running parallel systems, reduced consultant spend and all that stuff. Is there still that path to a 60% or lower efficiency ratio? Thanks.\n",
      "JANE FRASER (CEO): Happy New Year, Jim. I know you want to talk about the guidance, so let me put it into context here. Last year, you've heard me be very clear about our two priorities. First one is driving the business performance and the second is executing the Transformation. You've seen this quarter, you've seen last quarter, you've seen the full year our businesses are delivering the progress we wanted them to.\n",
      "The strategy is working. We've changed the business mix. We're generating more fee-based revenues. You see that in Services with Non-interest Revenue up 37% this year, Wealth Non-interest Revenue up 15%, Investment Banking Return on Average Tangible Common Equity: Return on Average Tangible fees up 35%, an important part of the mix around the quality of our earnings.\n",
      "We said Services as a crown jewel. It's delivered growth, high returns, it's taken share. It's a crown jewel. We made a strategic play in Wealth, and you've seen us very steadily prove out why we can be a force globally with a clear path to delivering the financial performance that we said we would do. We've consistently delivered on our revenue and expense targets. And I see a lot more opportunity and more upside to strengthen our business performance. We're very tangibly getting after it. We're pretty excited by it.\n",
      "The second priority, Transformation. I've got to tell you, I'm broadly pleased with the progress we've made in risk and compliance and accountability. Kind of excited by the work we've got going on in controls for the business as well at the moment. We've been very transparent. Data is an area we have more work to do in. We increased our investments last year, as you know. And then as part of the annual planning process, we took a big step back to reassess our plan. And I decided, along with Mark and the management team, we needed to expand the scope and accelerate some of the work to satisfy our regulators' expectations.\n",
      "I'm confident that the decision to do that, it was the right one. It's the right one for our Transformation efforts, it’s certainly the right one for the firm overall. I could have taken a short-term decision to cut other investments that are important for our long-term competitiveness, I'm just not going to do that. You shouldn't want me to do that. And as I said in the opening comments, this 2026 target is a waypoint, not the final destination.\n",
      "MARK MASON (CFO): I just want to address the second part of your question, Jim, in terms of the path to the less than 60%. I think Jane framed it out quite nicely in that we're building a franchise that will have continued and sustainable top line revenue momentum. We are focused on driving out the inefficiencies and stranded costs and Legacy Franchise expenses from the organization and the benefits from these investments we've made in the Transformation will yield a lower cost structure over time as well. And so the combination of those things will get us to that targeted operating efficiency as we come out of 2026 at less than 60%. So yes, there is still a path, and we are focused on that path.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 2, Justification: Mark Mason directly confirms the continued path to a sub-60% efficiency ratio and explicitly states that the company is focused on driving out inefficiencies, stranded costs, and legacy expenses, which directly addresses the analyst's query about eliminating parallel systems and reducing consultant spend. While a specific quantification of 'how much more' is not provided, the answer is mostly direct in confirming the ongoing efforts and the long-term goal.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "SAUL MARTINEZ (Analyst): Mark, the Net Interest Income ex-Markets outlook, if I just take the fourth quarter and annualize that, I get to something in the neighborhood of, I think, around $47.4 billion, $47.5 billion which is above the full year 2024 level. I'm not sure exactly what “up modestly” means, if that's 1%, 3%, 4%, but, and correct me if you think I’m wrong, but it seems like maybe there's a little bit of conservatism built in? If you can just comment on how you think, and how we should think about the quarterly trajectory of NI ex-Markets? Obviously, there's a day count issue in 1Q, but maybe how do you think through like, how we should expect that Net Interest Income to evolve over the course of the year?\n",
      "MARK MASON (CFO): I mean, why don't I just kind of cut to the chase on it a little bit, Saul, in the sense that, “up modestly”, call it a couple of percentage points, 2 to 3 percentage points or so, right, in terms of how I think about it. And I think I've taken, I’ve gone through kind of the tailwinds and headwinds, so I won't kind of take you through that again. But I think the important takeaway should be that we're going to see continued momentum across the franchise driven by loan growth in the Branded Card side of the business and continued deposit momentum, particularly operating deposits in Services. And we're going to do everything that we always do around the management of pricing, and we'll get a benefit from how we've been managing our investment portfolio as those things mature. The combination of those efforts will offset, more than offset some of the headwinds that you'd expect in a declining rate environment, and modestly is, call it, 2% to 3%.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 4, Justification: The CFO directly quantified the term \"up modestly\" as 2-3 percentage points, which was a clear answer to one part of the question. However, the response entirely bypassed the analyst's specific inquiry about the \"quarterly trajectory\" or how Net Interest Income ex-Markets is expected to evolve throughout the year, instead offering general drivers for overall growth without detailing the quarterly path.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "JOHN MCDONALD (Analyst): Okay. Great. And then my next question is, could you clarify what you're expecting this year for card net charge-offs? Understand the quarterly cadence has seasonality. But for the full year, it sounds like you're expecting the charge-offs to be in the range of last year's guidance. Can you just kind of clarify that? And then maybe just talk about provision build, which you had a lot of in 2024 and whether that could slow down as the maturation of balances slows down? Thank you.\n",
      "MARK MASON (CFO): Sure. So in terms of the net credit losses and the forecast that we have, we are expecting that the net credit losses will be at the high end of the range that we've given. So in the case of Branded Cards, that 3.5% to 4% is the full year range that we've given. In the case of Retail Services, it's 5.75% to 6.25%, excuse me, and so right now, Retail Services is at that high end at 6.28% for 2024. We'd expect it to stay at that high end, and then on Branded Cards, we're at 3.64%, we'd expect it to creep up to about the 4% level over the course of the year. But remember, that is a full year Net Credit Loss rate, and we know that there's seasonality through the quarters. And so you'll see movement through the quarters based on that dynamic.\n",
      "And then just in terms of the provision build, there are a couple of drivers there. One is obviously volume, and we do expect to see volume growth in U.S. Personal Banking. So that will be an important factor in how the Current Expected Credit Losses calculations are done. And then the second driver is obviously, as you know, we run models and the models they have a base scenario, they have a downside, an upside scenario depending on the broader macro factors, unemployment, Gross Domestic Product, et cetera, et cetera, and our weighting towards the likelihood of high or upside or downside scenario, those factors become important considerations in the provisioning. And so that's kind of how we think about that going into 2025. I hope that helps.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 4, Justification: The response directly clarifies the expected full-year net charge-offs by providing specific ranges and outlooks. However, it largely avoids the second part of the question which asked if provision build could slow down due to balance maturation. Instead of addressing the slowdown or the impact of balance maturation, the CFO discusses general drivers of provisioning like volume growth and macroeconomic models, thus redirecting from the specific inquiry.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "MATT O’CONNOR (Analyst): And I guess, like how do you know that the recent increase that you're modeling internally in these areas, how do you know you're spending enough and in the right ways to address your goals in the Transformation and also satisfy the regulatory requirements?\n",
      "JANE FRASER (CEO): Well, if I jump in, I feel very confident indeed that we know what we need to do. We know what we need to be spending on. Through the annual planning process that that concluded last month, it was clear we did need to invest more. We increased the scope of some of the work on the data front. We brought some other work forward. We looked at what we needed to do on the technology front and some of the critical investments. So this is pretty forensic and when we're looking at Transformation, we're looking at technology, we know what our target states need to be, and we know what we need to do to get there and the outcomes we need to be delivering.\n",
      "So we've got our arms around this, and I think you're hearing that confidence from us around what we need to do. We know the investments we need to make. You know what the outcomes and the benefits for shareholders and the regulatory side need to be.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 4, Justification: The CEO's response strongly asserts confidence and knowledge about what needs to be done and spent, but it consistently avoids explaining *how* they know they are spending 'enough' and 'in the right ways'. While mentioning processes like annual planning and areas of investment, the answer provides no specific methodology or metrics to justify the sufficiency and correctness of their spending, which was the core of the analyst's question.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "ERIKA NAJARIAN (Analyst): Thank you. Hate to ask the umpteenth question on the buyback, but clearly, the way the stock is reacting today, the buyback is very important to your shareholders. I guess my first question, if I could have the two questions, is it's very clear that you want to return capital to shareholders. It's very clear that you have excess capital. It's very clear that your PPNR trajectory is positive. And so what are the specific mile markers that that Citi needs to see in order to increase that pacing from that $1.5 billion a quarter to something is more suggestive of a pace that that would be in line with that $20 billion authorization? And I know that's been asked of you already, but is it the consent order? Is it the stress test? We had some news over the holidays that were positive for the sector. Like what are those specific mile markers? I mean you're doing it on the PPNR side, right? Like what do you need to see to have even more confidence, again, like leaning into Betsy’s words, to go all in on the buyback?\n",
      "MARK MASON (CFO): Yes. So thank you for the question. Let me make clear a couple of things. So one, and I've said this already, so I apologize for repeating myself, but one, our target for Common Equity Tier 1 is 13.1%, and so what you're going to see over the course of the year is us managing down to that target? That's kind of one point.\n",
      "The second point I want to be clear is that it's not the consent order. That's not something that that is impacting the capital actions and decisions that we take. We obviously forecast out the performance. As I've said, Jane has said already, we see very strong continued earnings momentum, managing towards a 13.1% Common Equity Tier 1 ratio. And you'll see the buyback trajectory reflect getting down to that Common Equity Tier 1.\n",
      "The one thing I will mention, and you mentioned already is that we obviously have another Comprehensive Capital Analysis process, stress test that we will go through. And none of us can predict kind of what's on the other side of that from an SCB point of view, but that will be an important factor as we get through the first half of the year and into the second half of the year in terms of kind of the level of buybacks that we will be taking on a quarter-by-quarter basis.\n",
      "So I hope that helped. There are no artificial constraints, so to speak, that are in place. This is us planning and forecasting the performance of the franchise ensuring they can fuel high-returning growth opportunities so that we're building a sustainable franchise, looking at the capital requirements that we have and the management buffer that we put in place and therefore, taking that excess capacity and putting it towards buybacks, but with an eye towards the regulatory environment that we're in, and what I mean by that are the capital requirements that come out of the annual stress testing process that's run. So that's the basics of it as we sit here today.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 4, Justification: The CFO directly addresses that the consent order is not a factor and states the stress test will be an 'important factor.' However, the answer avoids providing the 'specific mile markers' or concrete conditions that would lead to an *increase* in the buyback pacing, instead offering general capital management goals and emphasizing regulatory uncertainty regarding the stress test outcome.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "GERARD CASSIDY (Analyst): Well, I appreciate the insights. And then as a follow-up question, and I really don't mean this as a ‘what have you done for me lately?’ type of question because you guys have made so much progress in what you're doing in your strategic changes here. But can you talk about the U.S. Personal Banking, many of your questions today is about the Return on Average Tangible Common Equity consolidated and how you can improve that, and this business has a very low Return on Average Tangible Common Equity as you guys know, below your cost of capital. And structurally, when you look at it, if you look at the loans at the end of period just over $220 billion, your deposits about $90 billion, which is quite a bit different than your peers who have much higher ROEs. So how do you approach this business? And again, I know you've been very busy divesting a lot of the businesses that are not important, but it seems to me that this is a giant hurdle that you guys have to approach at some point in the near future.\n",
      "JANE FRASER (CEO): Let me just chat a bit through this. So what’s the path to the higher returns in U.S. Personal Banking, it’s coming from top line revenue growth, improved expense base and also a lot more normalized credit environment, and that gets us to the mid- to high-teen returns in the medium term. I think we feel very confident and comfortable in that. You're seeing the proof points I talked about Banking, Wealth earlier, we’ve had another good quarter of revenue growth, had the ninth consecutive quarter of positive operating leverage. So I think you should be getting some comfort around that.\n",
      "What's going to drive that growth? Co-brands, we just extended with American to be their sole issuer. It's going to give exciting benefits to the American Airlines and the Citi cardholders. And it will be beneficial for both our growth and our returns. In the proprietary front, we're investing. There's a lot of investment in innovation to drive growth. The refreshed Strata Premier Card, we've been enhancing the reward offerings and you're seeing us often now #1 in recognitions and awards around that area.\n",
      "Retail Services being forensically focused on improving the partnership economics and driving top line growth. And then Retail Banking, there we're driving primary checking growth, we’ve put in simplified banking, so we get a much more streamlined customer proposition that's driving more of a relationship-based banking approach as opposed to a transactional one.\n",
      "Importantly as well, the Retail Bank has been feeding our Wealth business. I think you heard me earlier talking about that almost $3 trillion “off us” investment opportunity that we have from the retail banking customer base. We transferred $17 billion of deposits from U.S. Personal Banking to Wealth, so you've got to take that, those dynamics into account. So I hope you're taking from me, I feel confident in our ability to get to the medium-term targets we set for the business of mid- to high-teens. I feel comfortable about the growth trajectory that we've got based off the innovations we're putting through and the changes. And good expense discipline and a better credit environment. So when you look at the mix of our business, I think you'll see us performing nicely here.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 4, Justification: The CEO provided a detailed strategy for improving returns in U.S. Personal Banking, addressing top-line growth, expense management, and credit environment. However, the answer largely avoided the analyst's specific and detailed question regarding the significant structural imbalance between loans ($220B) and deposits ($90B) in that business, which was highlighted as a key differentiator from peers and a hurdle to ROE improvement. While deposit-related initiatives were mentioned, the core structural disparity was not directly acknowledged or addressed.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "GERARD CASSIDY (Analyst): Okay, I got it. Our expense report on this end. Anyway, just following up, Mark, on your comments about the IPO with Banamex. Can you guys remind us, or refresh our memories, on when the IPO process starts, once it goes public, what percentage ownership do you guys expect to have? And second, have you given us any color on whether you expect to report a gain on this transaction or a loss as you just referenced, that will go through the P&L?\n",
      "MARK MASON (CFO): We haven't given any sense for the exact timing of that. As you know, this is a process. And so Jane just spoke to the timing of that process, the first step, having been completed on December 1 with the separation, we are now obviously gearing up and readying ourselves for the IPO.\n",
      "There'll obviously be important filings associated with that given our intent to dual list, there will be regulatory approvals that are required kind of as we make headway with potential investors as part of the IPO process. And so there are a series of IPO steps that we will need to take over the course of the year in order to continue to ready ourselves and there are things that we don't control. Like as Jane mentioned, the regulatory approval process and timing for that as well as the market conditions.\n",
      "And so all of those factors are important. And then how the IPO occurs in terms of percentage that is taken on at that first tranche versus follow-on tranches are important factors on when we get to deconsolidation. And so I haven't given you an exact timing on that but you can envision kind of 15% tranches that happen over kind of a 12-, 18-month, 24-month period. And then obviously reaching a point of deconsolidation at which point that currency translation adjustment starts to flow through the P&L. There's no material impact on capital, but it does flow through the P&L. And then ultimately, we exit 100% over the course of time.\n",
      "So I'm sorry, I'm not giving you precise dates and percentages. And part of that is because we are obviously on the front end of not only readying ourselves but considering alternative IPO structures and potential investors/shareholders as part of that process.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 4, Justification: The CFO explicitly states he cannot provide precise dates or percentages, directly avoiding the timing and initial ownership percentage questions. While offering context on the process and potential future tranches, he avoids the direct question about a gain or loss, instead referring to a 'currency translation adjustment' without specifying the impact on the transaction.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "SAUL MARTINEZ (Analyst): Okay. Fair enough. And then on the expense outlook getting to below $53 billion in 2026, I know that's consistent with what you've said in the past, does imply a pretty sharp reduction in 2026, especially in light of continued revenue growth, it's pretty material operating leverage. Just I mean, how much benefit do you get from a more normalized severance? In other words, how much are we thinking about severance coming down? What's sort of the impact or how to think about the Legacy, stranded costs coming down? Just maybe a little bit more meat on the bone in terms of how much these items will benefit 2026 versus 2025?\n",
      "MARK MASON (CFO): Look, a couple of things. As I look at our severance costs, which, as I mentioned, has been running high, it was $700 million, we're forecasting $600 million in 2025. I think kind of normal through the cycle is probably, call it, $300 million or so. And so that gives you some sense for that.\n",
      "I think the other thing is, if you look at the other page, and again, there are a number of drivers or levers that we intend to pull to bring that down. But in the All Other page where you look to the right, we show wind-downs and what's remaining in terms of Legacy Franchise. If you add those numbers together, $1.9 billion or so of expenses and think about a subset of that being stranded. And we're going to continue to focus on how do we bring down stranded costs over the next couple of years.\n",
      "So those are two important factors or contributors to the decline from the slightly lower than $53.8 billion to the $53 billion. There are additional productivity saves from prior investments that we've made. But those are important factors. And then as we look at the Transformation spend, that will continue to, or start to pay dividends or help to bring down costs as well. So you've got really those four variables that contribute to us bringing that number down. And as Jane has mentioned, we're going to even post 2026, continue to bring, or drive out more inefficiencies around the organization to fund required investments for the business growth and all with a continued focus on getting to less than 60% as we exit 2026, less than 60% operating efficiency.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 3, Justification: The CFO partially addresses the question by providing a normalized figure for severance costs, giving some indication of the potential savings. However, for 'Legacy, stranded costs' and other expense reduction drivers, the answer identifies the categories but avoids providing specific quantitative benefits or a clear breakdown of 'how much' these items will contribute to the 2026 expense reduction, leaving the analyst's request for 'more meat on the bone' largely unfulfilled for those components.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "MATT O’CONNOR (Analyst): Hi, I just want to follow up on Page 9 where you break out the technology and Transformation investment spend. And sorry if I missed this, but did you talk about the pace of those two levels in your 2025 and 2026 expense guidance? I know directionally, you said it's going up. But did you give a magnitude?\n",
      "MARK MASON (CFO): I did not. Obviously, for both technology and Transformation those are areas that we are going to continue to invest in for all the reasons that we've mentioned. They obviously contribute to the number in 2025 being slightly down from the $53.8 billion, but they also represent, as I mentioned, what we believe is required to kind of get the work done that we need to get done. And so those numbers will increase.\n",
      "There are lots of puts and takes, as you know, through an annual expense forecast, right, including, as you would expect, we've got volume, we’ve got revenue growth here that's going to come with volume growth. Volume, incentive comp, there's merit increases that go with that. And then we also have a series of productivity actions that are playing through to offset those headwinds, whether it be the additional carryover from the org simplification and full year impact of that, or some of the Legacy/stranded coming down.\n",
      "And so there are puts and takes, but Transformation and technology specifically, we are continuing to invest in, in order to achieve what we need to get done here and also ensure the businesses have what they need to drive sustainable growth going forward.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 4, Justification: The CFO directly answered that they had not previously provided the magnitude. However, despite the analyst's clear follow-up question seeking the \"pace\" or \"magnitude\" of technology and transformation investment for 2025 and 2026, the CFO avoided providing any specific figures. Instead, the response broadly discussed continued investment and overall expense drivers, sidestepping the quantitative aspect of the question.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Glenn Schorr (Analyst): Hi, thanks very much. So, I know it's early, but I'm curious if you could help us with a refresher on Treasury and Trade Solutions and Services in general. In terms of what opportunities there's risk, but also opportunities in helping clients manage through this re-tariffing and redrawing of economic lines. I think about nationalization and vertical integration as bad things, but a lot of shifting, and maybe you can help clients deal with all that shifting. But anything any help there would be great.\n",
      "Jane Fraser (CEO): Glenn, I would be delighted to do so. So, our diversified business mix is very well positioned for a variety of scenarios. We think we've got a very broad suite of products and services. And they are the ones that clients need if they're going to be repositioning for a new order in trade or broader impacts here. And think about what you've seen over the last few years where we played a very central role: the Ukraine- Russia war, China, the COVID-related supply chains. We saw a lot of growth from deepening with clients and acquiring new ones because they need us, because we have exactly the expertise and the products and services that multinational institutions need, and we have them in the places that they need it. Now, the mix of those different revenues, different products and services we have could be different depending on which scenario prevails. And what I have to say at the moment, the level of engagement that we have with our clients all around the world, is just off the charts, given the unique depth of our presence and the insights we have in all the markets.\n",
      "So, if I dig down a bit more, what would the persistence of high tariffs, what would it mean? Well, it would dampen economic activity here in the in the U.S. and abroad. Cross-border trade flows will change, we'll be in the middle of facilitating that. So, we expect to be very busy there along with the hedging and associated financing activity that goes with it because it's not just about Treasury and Trade Solutions. This is about the bundle of different capabilities we bring to bear. And take some comfort, look at what happened with the Ukraine war. We grew a lot in that time period. Equally, most of our business is very local. Think of what Services is, it's payroll, it's supplier management, it's liquidity, it's payables, it's receivables. And we're very deeply embedded into our clients' day-to-day operations in every market they work in as well as across market flows. And that's not going to change. It's not nearly as sensitive to tariffs. And I would say, I think all of us recognize the environment is very fluid right now. So let me also just say for clarity sake, at the firmwide level, our Return on Average Tangible Common Equity targets for 2026 are still 10% to 11%. The drivers behind them are the same, but the revenue mix might be different. We'll certainly know more as things get clearer as to how that plays out.\n",
      "I think actually the other thing you mentioned about nationalization. Most of our clients have been clients for decades. I mean, a number of them have been clients for over a century. And it would not be British understatement to say that we are deeply embedded into them. I mean, it is extraordinary how deep we are. We've been on the ground for over a century, and we are viewed as quasi-local in most of these markets. Citi is not a bunch of suitcase bankers that fly in. We're not transactional. We're very unique in the footprint. And these factors do make us less vulnerable to the different geopolitical dynamics that are going on.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 2, Justification: The CEO largely addressed the question by explaining how Citi's Treasury and Trade Solutions help clients manage re-tariffing through facilitating trade flows, hedging, and financing. She also directly addressed the nationalization concern by highlighting Citi's deep and long-standing local embeddedness as a mitigating factor. While the answer was comprehensive and included some general statements and a brief mention of firm-wide targets, it provided specific details on how they assist clients with the challenges raised.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Betsy Graseck (Analyst): Hi good morning. Two questions. Just first on the buyback. I noticed you came in at $1.75 billion. Is that right this quarter?\n",
      "Mark Mason (CFO): Yes.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 1, Justification: The CFO's answer \"Yes\" directly and completely confirms the specific figure mentioned in the analyst's question. There is no ambiguity or attempt to avoid the question whatsoever.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "EBRAHIM POONAWALA (Analyst): And if I can draw a parallel to the Banking segment with the Return on Average Tangible Common Equity is about 5% to 6% last few quarters. There you brought in Vis Raghavan from JPMorgan. Just give us a sense of could we see a similar trajectory in that business over the next 12 months and where the opportunities are to improve that ROE?\n",
      "JANE FRASER (CEO): Yes. I think absolutely, a strong performance, the strategy we have in place is delivering nicely. So if you look at the revenues, the investment banking fees, positive operating leverage all through the year and gaining share. All three products gaining share in all three in all of the geographies we're in, I'm really excited and happy to see the health care and technology, two areas that we've been investing heavily behind. And you're also seeing us playing a leading role in some of the key transactions, the biggest transactions last year. Mars Kellanova, single adviser, big role in Boeing, and then just this week, the J&J acquisition of Intracellular. So the deals that matter, this is where you're seeing Citi playing a leading role in.\n",
      "So when Vis joined, the mandate, a bit similar to Andy, becoming a top three investment bank, deliver the full potential of One Citi to our clients. So we've got a lot of upside there, instilling some more discipline in capital allocation, client coverage, some of the cross-firm linkages. We're getting a lot more from our people. We've been bringing in some great new talent we've also been cutting some of the unproductive spend.\n",
      "I think what you can see is we're just on a path of systematically growing our wallet. We'll be improving our operating margin, generating higher returns. That should be your expectation over the next couple of years of what you'll see from us. And as we head into great environment in 2025 that should be pretty conducive for a lot of client activity. I'm very confident we're well positioned. We've got the groundwork done to take advantage of it.\n",
      "MARK MASON (CFO): Ebrahim, I thought I heard you say Return on Average Tangible Common Equity of 5%. It's actually 7% for the full year for Banking and on its way to the target that we've set of mid-teens for our Banking business.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 4, Justification: The response largely avoids the analyst's specific request for a 'similar trajectory' in ROE over the 'next 12 months'. While it discusses strategic actions, positive operational trends, and long-term goals, the CEO explicitly shifts the timeframe to 'next couple of years' for generating higher returns, and the CFO offers a long-term 'mid-teens' target, without detailing the short-term trajectory or specific opportunities for improvement within the requested 12-month period.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "ERIKA NAJARIAN (Analyst): Got it. And just my second question, as we think about 2026. And again, I don't want to put words in your mouth because clearly, it's very critical in terms of your targets and hitting them. So you targeted less than $53 billion. Is it fair to assume like Jim was asking that $51 billion to $53 billion is not the target, but it's less than $53 billion? But to that end, I mean just taking a step back, I think, Jane, you said something very important in that want to get to the returns in a sustainable way. And clearly, your shareholders are scarred by previous management when the returns went up to double digits and went back tumbling down and wasn't sustainable. And should we just really think of this as, look, like it takes a while to turn around a money center bank and 2026 may have been the target in 2022, but we're going to get there in 2027, 2028 anyway, and just doing this in a sustainable way, and we're not robbing the bank of investments.\n",
      "I guess I'm just trying to think about everybody is super focused on what you had said previously, now you have different targets, but is it just really like, look, it just takes longer, we'll get there, but just takes longer. And maybe just an addendum to that, how should we expect Banamex to impact that 10% to 11% Return on Average Tangible Common Equity in terms of the immediate impact after IPO and then after you deploy that excess capital that you get back?\n",
      "JANE FRASER (CEO): Erika, we chose the words very carefully to say that 2026 is a way point, it's not the destination. And when I'm looking at it, I'm looking out to 2027, 2028, what is the bank we want to be in terms of our strategy, our performance, our culture, all those different dimensions. And we just relentlessly keep going down that path, but we're going to take the right and responsible decisions as we go down it. So our potential is for more than our medium-term target Return on Average Tangible Common Equity, the potential of the bank and the journey that we're on is to improve our returns beyond there, for sure.\n",
      "And then you asked a question about Banamex. So, on that front, look, we had a singular focus on the separation of two banks, that was an enormous body of work because we had to put up Mexico's eighth largest Bank de Novo in a very short period of time. It got done December 1, that was over 100 regulatory approvals to get that done. Now we have turned our full attention to the IPO. We're getting ready to be able to IPO as soon we can. But given market conditions and given regulatory approvals, it's possible this could go into 2026, but we're doing everything in our control to be ready as soon as possible. We are not the right owner of the bank. We are committed to the simplification of Citi. We will follow a responsible process here.\n",
      "MARK MASON (CFO): And just in terms of the impact and the timing that Jane referenced, just keep in in mind that the financial impact of exiting Banamex comes two forms. One is the gain or loss on sale and two is the risk-weighted asset release. The gain or loss on sale will run through the P&L at deconsolidation, so that's the point where we've gotten, or we've IPO-ed more than the 50%. And the ultimate benefit will be driven by the Risk-Weighted Assets release when we fully divest our stake. And so hopefully, that helps, but it's not until we’ve deconsolidated that we see that P&L impact and the Cumulative Translation Adjustment and other things like that kind of flow through the P&L for Banamex.\n",
      "GERARD CASSIDY (Analyst): Jane, I'll pass on the haggis, but I'll take you up on the whiskey.\n",
      "JANE FRASER (CEO): I didn't say I was buying just to be clear.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 4, Justification: The executives avoided directly addressing the specific 2026 expense target, instead reframing it as a \"way point\" and focusing on longer-term strategic goals. While the CFO explained the accounting mechanics of the Banamex divestiture, neither executive provided any qualitative or quantitative information on how it would impact the 10-11% Return on Average Tangible Common Equity target, which was the core of the analyst's question.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Mike Mayo (Analyst): Okay. The flip side of this is you did say the drivers are same. They might be different in magnitude to take you from where you are now you had over 9% Return on Average Tangible Common Equity in the quarter. You said you're on track to get to 10% to 11% next year. Can you put a little meat on the bones kind of verbal waterfall chart, if you would, or maybe some numbers around org simplification stranded costs, productivity savings. How do we get from 9% in the first quarter to that magical double-digit return target for next year?\n",
      "Mark Mason (CFO): Again, as we talked about before, it is a combination of continued momentum on the top line.\n",
      "And this is Jane's point around how that mix may evolve, but the 3% plus that we're expecting this year, and again, in 2026, is an important contribution to that.\n",
      "You often see in our business where one may be under pressure, the other one tends to outperform and overcompensate whether it be Banking fees and how those evolve, but volatility that may come with that, that uplifts the Markets business. So that continued focus on top-line performance will be important.\n",
      "You'veheard me reaffirm the expense target for 2025 in terms of getting down to the $53.4 [billion]. We still have a path to getting less than $53 [billion] in 2026. That will be important. Obviously, if revenue softens there, we will see expenses come down in tandem with that, a combination of volume-related transaction costs but other levers that we will look to pull in the productivity savings we expect to come from prior investments is an important aspect as well.\n",
      "And then we've continued to optimize the use of our balance sheet and the capital that we have. You see that we have brought our Common Equity Tier 1 down to 13.4%. We're continuing to return capital. Those become very important aspects to getting to that target.\n",
      "Now look, it's uncertain and how the world evolves is hard to forecast at this point, right? So could a stressed macro environment create an impact on credit and a build of reserves, absolutely, right? That could happen towards the end of 2025. If it does happen in 2025 and losses end up showing up in 2026. They end up being self-funded, so to speak, by the reserves that would have been established.\n",
      "So, we sit here today and as Jane mentioned, we're seeing nothing that would suggest that we shouldn't be targeting the 10% to 11% [Return on Average Tangible Common Equity]. So, we remain committed to that 10% to 11% [Return on Average Tangible Common Equity]. There's a path with the combination of those levers that I've mentioned. And importantly, this quarter is yet another proof point that our strategy is resilient, that we've got the right team on the ground to execute against it and that it's showing up in our numbers it's showing up in our returns.\n",
      "Jane Fraser (CEO): And I'd just remind everyone, we're a very different bank than the one we were a few years ago in terms of our business mix, our risk profile and all the investments we've made into the business. And I think you can see us managing the bank doing what we say we'll do and please take some confidence in that.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 4, Justification: The management lists general drivers (top-line, expenses, capital optimization) for achieving the ROTCE target but avoids providing the specific 'numbers' or 'verbal waterfall chart' that the analyst explicitly requested regarding the contributions of items like org simplification, stranded costs, and productivity savings. The answer remains high-level and reiterates commitment without detailing the quantitative path.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Ebrahim Poonawala (Analyst): I guess Mark, just wanted to on Slide 9 and the capital waterfall. I guess we are all thinking about what buybacks can do in the second half of this year. So, if you don't mind, one, the Risk-Weighted Assets sort of drag, the 32 basis points. Is that normal as we think about what the Risk-Weighted Assets consumption should look like? Just talk about that in the context of getting to a 13.1% Common Equity Tier 1 by the end of the year. And how we can back into the pace of buybacks.\n",
      "Mark Mason (CFO): Yes. So, I'd say a couple of things. So one, last quarter, we announced a $20 billion share repurchase program. And we continue to feel good about that program, as you would expect. And we increased our buybacks this year, or this quarter, I should say, to the $1.75 billion, seeing the strength of the performance that was playing out through the quarter. And so those are both, I think, indications of our continued commitment to returning capital to the shareholders. We're clear on where we're trading, and we're clear that, that is a smart thing to do once we've funded demand from a client point of view across our businesses, that's accretive to returns. And so, the Risk-Weighted Assets consumption is tied to that demand that we see. We think we've seen good client demand across the platform that's helped drive the top line momentum that you see in each and every one of our businesses that's helped to drive the improved returns that you see in the quarter in each and every one of our businesses. And as we see that demand, again, accretive in returns, we'll be looking to meet that as a first priority. We are targeting the 13.1% [Common Equity Tier 1 Capital ratio] by the end of the year. But as you know, we'll get a new stressed capital buffer in June on the heels of the Dodd-Frank Act Stress Test/Comprehensive Capital Analysis work that's just been submitted, and we'll have to see what that tells us. That's hard to forecast as you well know. And so based on what that tells us will inform that downward trajectory, but that is what we're focused on. The combination of funding growth that's accretive to returns and returning capital to shareholders in a way that's consistent with that repurchase program.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 4, Justification: The CFO avoids directly answering how to 'back into the pace of buybacks' by stating that the new stressed capital buffer is 'hard to forecast.' While explaining the drivers for Risk-Weighted Assets consumption, the answer does not specify if the 32 basis points drag is 'normal' as requested, thereby sidestepping the quantitative aspects of the question.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Ken Usdin (Analyst): Very good. And one just a follow-up on Net Interest Income and your outlook. Did you make any changes to including card fee still in the Net Interest Income guide? Is that now removed? Does that fill in there? I know there's a lot of puts and takes given the change in the forward curve, if you can help us understand which curve you're using and some of the balancing act there, that would be great.\n",
      "Mark Mason (CFO): Yes. So, look, the late fee impact is, for us, is important, and we included it in the range that we had given, and we still feel good. We've now removed it, obviously, with the changes that have taken place, but we have not changed our range because there's obviously going to be puts and takes that occur.\n",
      "It does have an impact on the Retail Services print that we have in the quarter and more importantly, the year-over-year that you see there of down 11% because, as you know, we share profits with those partners. And so that that that down 11% we see in the quarter is informed by last year where we had an assumption that the late fee rule was going to come into play and therefore, we had less profit to share with our partners versus this year first quarter where we've assumed it would not come into play and, therefore, have more profits to share with our partners. And so important to point that out on Retail Services, which jumps out in U.S. Personal Banking, that it's unlikely that we see that downward percentage in the remaining quarters because it's really a byproduct of what we assumed last year. versus this year on late fees.\n",
      "In terms of the curve and the Net Interest Income guidance we gave, we assumed two to three [U.S. interest rate] cuts. We're now assuming a fourth but given the timing and that it would be back-loaded in the year, it doesn't have a significant impact on the Net Interest Income guidance that we've given, the 2% to 3% ex-Markets.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 1, Justification: The CFO directly addressed both parts of the analyst's question. They confirmed the removal of late fees from the Net Interest Income guide and clearly stated the updated interest rate cut assumptions used for the NII guidance, explaining the minimal impact on the range. The response provided specific and relevant information without vagueness or redirection.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "John McDonald (Analyst): I wanted to ask Jane about the Banamex IPO planning. Just an update on where that stands, assuming that market conditions create some risk to the timing. Is it fair to say that there were pros and cons from the shareholder perspective to holding on to that business longer given that it's a profitable entity?\n",
      "Jane Fraser (CEO): Look, first of all, we continue to be on track with the preparation for the IPO, John. I was just down in Mexico last week.\n",
      "And the team is fully focused on driving Banamex's business performance. I was very pleased to see improvements and not the underlying drivers of their performance when is down there.\n",
      "And they're also focused on getting the work done to be able to go public, things like the prepared audited financial statements or filling the various regulatory requirements.\n",
      "As we told them we want to see the business performance improving and we want to make sure that we are doing everything in our control to be in a position to IPO by the year-end.\n",
      "And to the second part of your question, we will always look at what we believe to be in the best interest of our shareholders. We believe that the best interest of our shareholders is to be able to IPO this business. We think that is the right thing. It fits with Citi's strategy for all the reasons we've talked about in the past, we're the best owner of the corporate franchise we have there. We are not the best owner of a domestic bank. So, the timing of when we IPO will be driven by market conditions. It will be driven by the timing of regulatory approvals. So that could move that from 2025 into 2026. And we will always be guided by what we think will maximize value for our shareholders.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 1, Justification: The CEO directly addresses both parts of the question. She provides an update on the IPO preparation and explicitly acknowledges that market conditions and regulatory approvals could shift the timing from 2025 to 2026. Furthermore, she clearly states that IPOing the business is in the best interest of shareholders, explaining the strategic rationale rather than evading the 'pros of holding longer' aspect.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Mike Mayo (Analyst): Hi, I just wanted to continue the discussion about, on one hand you’re a port in the storm. You've been embedded decades and you're not a bunch of suitcase bankers. So that message has landed. On the other hand, I mean, you are the bank that facilitates global trade in the middle of a global trade war. And so, I think the concern is not just the possibility that that revenues will nosedive, but credit will implode or as I've heard many, many times that Citigroup is going to stub its toe, just 100 countries in the mix of it all. What else can you say in addition to what you said to either reassure investors that the oversight is strong or that you have your arms around the situation, the best that that you can, again, recognizing it's a fluid situation. Thank you.\n",
      "Jane Fraser (CEO): So, you've seen us perform extremely well over the last few years in the face of pretty wrenching changes in the global economy. You’ve seen it with say, shifts in supply chains after COVID and then between the geopolitical tensions that are going on, you saw it in pretty significant changes that were happening from the Russia and Ukraine war. And you see us exactly as that, we are where the clients come, it's hedging for foreign exchange, interest rates, commodities, you see it for how they're looking at changing their financing around, and we tend to be the ones that are helping them reconfigure the flows. So, from that point of view, we are the active agent in a lot this mix. And we are a port in the storm as I said, Mike, we've got very strong balance sheet, capital and liquidity to deploy. We have the big strategic changes and organization changes behind us, and they're enabling us to be on the front foot. And this is a firm that is much more agile and able to respond and be much more focused on clients right now. So, I feel good about this.\n",
      "Mark Mason (CFO): Yes. The only thing I'd add, I mean, Jane, you're spot on, right. We come in with a strong balance sheet, strong capital, strong liquidity. If you think about your point around credit, Mike, we've said repeatedly, and you can see it in the numbers. We skew towards the higher investment grade, larger multinationals who also come into this with strong balance sheets. We've been very disciplined about that risk framework, our risk appetite, both on the corporate side as well as it relates to our consumers. And then what we tend to see in times of stress is a flight to quality as it relates to deposits. And so again, depending on how this evolves, we're well positioned to manage whatever the needs are of our clients, whether that be lending needs or the storing of liquidity, and we're very well reserved to manage whatever credit risk may come with that despite us being skewed towards higher quality names in both of those demographics.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 2, Justification: The executives largely reiterate existing strengths such as a strong balance sheet, disciplined risk framework, and high-quality client base to reassure investors about managing global trade war risks. While this directly addresses the need for reassurance, it offers little additional specific detail on how oversight is strong or new measures beyond their established practices, leading to minor vagueness.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Ken Usdin (Analyst): Thanks, good morning. I wanted to follow up on the points you made about the consumer hanging in there through April. And Mark, you mentioned that there could be more uncertainty as we get later. But I believe you're still intact with your charge-off guides for the year. I think just noticing Retail Services was, I think, expectedly higher than high end at 6.43%. Can you just remind us again how you're expecting the cadence of credit card losses to trajected for both Branded Cards and Retail Services as you go forward? Thanks.\n",
      "Mark Mason (CFO): Sure. Again, we do obviously feel that we are well reserved here. We did expect to see a pickup in the first half of the year before trending down in the back half of the year. And so that's kind of the cadence that we'd expect between now and the end of the year. The first half is usually seasonally higher than the back half of the year, and you see that in Retail Services. I would also point out that and you can see it in the deck and I think it's the second page of the appendix but also in the supplement, you are starting to see that delinquency buckets, we show the 90-day plus delinquency bucket starting to trend down in Retail Services, that is also an important indicator in terms of how we look at the expected losses, if you will, in the go forward. And so that seasonality as well as that trend is a good sign.\n",
      "Jane Fraser (CEO): We've also, I think one of the pieces Gonzalo and the team have done a good job with is, they've been proactive and tightening risk and acquisitions and existing programs in the last couple of years. And I think that also puts us into another reason where we feel in a good position as we head into whatever lies ahead.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 3, Justification: The CFO provided a general cadence for credit card losses (pickup in H1, trending down in H2) but did not specifically detail the trajectory for Branded Cards, focusing more on Retail Services. The CEO's response discussed risk management and portfolio strength rather than the specific loss cadence for each segment, thus only partially addressing the question.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Betsy Graseck (Analyst): And I know you indicated that you're looking to keep pace. And I'm wondering, does that mean at $1.75 billion or does that mean keep pace with the increased Q-on-Q, which was $250 million? And so, I know you're laughing, just trying to understand how you're thinking about that, given what we discussed last quarter, which is you have so much opportunity here for buyback and the accretion is so powerful. So, if you don't mind.\n",
      "Mark Mason (CFO): Sure. So, look, we're targeting a similar level. As you know, we've been working to bring the Common Equity Tier 1 [Capital ratio] down. We brought it down 20 basis points this quarter. We're still focused on bringing it down to 13.1%. There is uncertainty. The uncertainty is multifaceted. And to some extent, you think about the uncertainty with the SCB. We'll hopefully get some clarity on that as we often do in the summer, and that will inform the pace at which we bring that that down. And then there's the broader market uncertainty, and we want to obviously be there to support clients, and the demand may come on the heels of that. And so, this quarter, like I said, similar level of share repurchases. $20 billion program that we will continue to work through. SCB clarity soon, hopefully, favorable clarity, and we're steadfast focused on it. Jane, I don't know if you want to add anything to that?\n",
      "Jane Fraser (CEO): We like buying back and giving capital back to our shareholders. So, it's a priority for us and will continue to be.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 4, Justification: The management directly avoided providing a specific dollar figure for the share buyback pace, opting instead for the vague phrase \"similar level.\" While they provided reasons for this lack of specificity, such as regulatory uncertainty and market conditions, they did not address the analyst's direct question about whether the target was $1.75 billion or the increased quarter-on-quarter pace.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Matt O’Connor (Analyst): Hi, just a follow-up on the expenses, came in a bit lower than expected 1Q even ex the accounting change. What's your thought process for the rest of the year? Because I'm getting at is off in 1Q the high-water mark. So, if you trickle down a little bit from here, that would imply costs coming in a below what you're expecting. Can you just talk about the trajectory here?\n",
      "Mark Mason (CFO): Sure. So again, I gave kind of stuck to the guidance that we had given in January. So expenses $53.4 [billion] for the full year. We did come in at $13.4 [billion] in the quarter. I kind of went through the puts and takes around that. I'd expect probably a bit of a tick up in Q2 when I think about the things in front of us and some of the continued investments that we plan to make in transformation and some of the other things underneath that, like data and regulatory reporting. And then I'd expect it to trend down so that we get to the target of the $53.4 [billion] that I referenced for the full year. And so likely see a tick up and then a trend down and landing the full year at the guidance here. Obviously, revenue moves. Sorry, go ahead.\n",
      "Matt O’Connor (Analyst): No, no, please go ahead.\n",
      "Mark Mason (CFO): I'd say, obviously, if revenue moves in either direction, we'll adjust accordingly. If we have upside to revenue, you'd expect to see some of that variable in transaction costs move in that direction as well. And if we see pressure on revenues, we'll be focused on ensuring that we are bringing our expenses down as well.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 1, Justification: The CFO directly addressed the question about the expense trajectory for the rest of the year. He clearly stated an expectation for a \"tick up in Q2\" due to investments, followed by a \"trend down\" to meet the full-year guidance, providing a specific path and implicitly answering if Q1 was the high-water mark.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Saul Martinez (Analyst): Just following up on the expenses. Your 2026 target of a 10% to 11% Return on Average Tangible Common Equity, I think you're targeting expenses being below $53 billion. I assume with the accounting change that should recalibrate to being below, call it, $53.5 billion, is that, or $52.5 billion, sorry. Is that a fair assumption or a conclusion from that?\n",
      "Mark Mason (CFO): Sure. $52.6 [billion].\n",
      "Saul Martinez (Analyst): I was just rounding down.\n",
      "Mark Mason (CFO): Yes. Yes, I bet. But yes, I mean it's a change in line-item terms of that association fee. And sure, I targeted 2026 as less than $53 [billion]. And with that $400 million, you sure you can deduct that from the $53 [billion].\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 1, Justification: The CFO provides a very direct answer, confirming the analyst's recalibration of the expense target with a precise figure ($52.6 billion). They explicitly validate the deduction of the $400 million accounting change from the original target, directly addressing the question without any vagueness or deflection.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Jim Mitchell (Analyst): Hey good morning. Maybe Jane, just following up on that conversation, and you talked about leaning into, as being a port in the storm and leaning into it. So, I guess in the near term, are you seeing sort of demand already in terms of your balance sheet, whether it's raising liquidity and deposit flow like sort of flight to safety deposit flows and sort of the trading aspect of it from this volatility in April, have you sort of already seen greater demand from clients?\n",
      "Jane Fraser (CEO): What I'd say about the clients at the moment, you're seeing deals still happening. We've done a number of them, as we've talked about, even over this last weekend, we were pretty busy, but I would say that most clients are pausing their plans.\n",
      "Now no one is taking bets in the market right now. We're seeing them prep for more headwinds. So, we're seeing some bolstering of already strong balance sheets.\n",
      "Remember, our client base aren't the smaller companies in the mid-market that are going to get more pummeled in this type of environment. So that our clients are getting ready. We're seeing some accelerating of imports to stockpile inventories. We are seeing a pausing on significant CapEx, while everyone waits to get clarity on the full agenda. And in that full agenda, remember, there's tax bill, there's deregulation actions. These are some positives that will be coming. It's a very big agenda. Clients appreciate it's going to take time.\n",
      "In terms of the trading side, what we're seeing is it is pretty orderly out there. There's a lot of complicated dynamics happening, but it's not being catalyzed by liquidity crisis or other things going on. Let's not fight the war, the last war. The issue we're tackling at the moment is something different. And we're seeing clients taking the opportunity to de-risk. We are, others are, so that if we have more turbulence ahead, everyone is in a stronger position for it, and that is a good thing.\n",
      "But it's early days, Jim. We've got to see how this unfolds.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 4, Justification: The CEO provides extensive observations about general client behavior and market conditions (e.g., clients pausing plans, bolstering their own balance sheets, de-risking, orderly trading environment) rather than directly confirming if Citi has seen increased demand for its specific balance sheet products, such as 'flight to safety' deposit flows. While 'de-risking' implies some trading activity, the response avoids directly addressing the 'greater demand' aspect for Citi's services, especially concerning liquidity and deposit inflows.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Vivek Juneja (Analyst): Thanks for taking my questions. A couple of them as follow-ups to questions that have been asked. First one for you, Mark. The doing buybacks of the dividending from the bank to the holding company that we just asked. How much are you willing to let your double leverage go up? Is there any sort of internal limits that you follow, what would be the implications of that from a funding cost standpoint?\n",
      "Mark Mason (CFO): Yes. Look, we have internal limits. We have management action triggers internally. We're not anywhere close to those limits or triggers. It's not something that I'm worried about as it relates to the buyback program that I have and/or the buybacks that we forecasted over the balance of the year.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 4, Justification: The CFO confirmed the existence of internal limits but avoided quantifying how much double leverage they are willing to let go up or providing specific numerical limits. While he stated he was not worried about funding costs, he did not elaborate on the specific implications for funding costs, thus avoiding the detailed aspect of the question.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Erika Najarian (Analyst): Got it. And just my second question. Mark, you mentioned the four cuts that's now embedded in your Net Interest Income outlook, I'm guessing that's for the U.S. How should we think about how you're thinking of global rates? Obviously, it's a basket of countries and currencies that we have to think about. And if your top exposures are exposed to lower rates, how should we think about deposit spreads in Services from here?\n",
      "Mark Mason (CFO): I think I'd say, I guess the easiest way to answer the question is to point to the IRE analysis that we show on a quarterly basis. And there are a lot of - that's obviously a risk measure. There are a lot of limitations associated with taking it too deeply or taking it too literally, but as you know, it is a view on how lower rates could impact Citi over a 12-month period. It assumes a static balance sheet, no growth, no change in composition or mix or changes in our hedging actions. And it is an instantaneous shock to the entire curve. With that said, we do break out the impact for U.S. dollar versus non-U.S. dollar. Remember, as you just referenced, there are over 60 currencies, but that asset sensitivity would suggest with a - in the fourth quarter - with a 100-basis point move across the currencies that the non-U.S. dollar impact would be $1 billion over a 12-month period. And so that take that with a grain of salt, but that gives you some sense as to the sensitivity to rates, that would assume all of those currencies and rates in those countries moved at the same time across the curve, and we did nothing to actively manage or dynamically manage the balance sheet.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 4, Justification: The CFO redirects to a high-level, model-based IRE analysis, emphasizing its significant limitations, which makes it less useful for understanding their actual outlook on global rates. Crucially, the response completely avoids addressing the specific question about the impact on deposit spreads in the Services segment, which was a key part of the analyst's inquiry.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "MIKE MAYO (Analyst): Hi, this is your first full year of having the five line of business structure. So, Mark, do you still have the same line of business targets that you had last year? And Jane, with all the, it must have been a degree of hell to organize this way, get rid of your two intercompany holding companies, eliminate five layers of management, expand span of control and you guys went through a lot last year. And I'm just wondering, is the worst over in terms of that kind of reorganization internally and the culture and the sentiment and how you see that continuing? But first, the concrete question about the targets, please.\n",
      "MARK MASON (CFO): So I guess I'll start first. So in terms of the targets, look, we set the targets across each of the lines of business for the medium term. We've obviously brought down the 2026 to 10% to 11%. And so you'd imagine there's some movement, at least for the 2026 in terms of those targets, Banking will likely be a little bit lower than the mid-15%, if I think about 2026 as being that medium-term target date. But over time, I expect that the targets that I've set are the targets that we will achieve and even more because, as Jane mentioned, 10% to 11%, while that's our 2026 target, it is not our longer-term target as we think about Return on Average Tangible Common Equity and the strength of these businesses in the aggregate franchise. So hopefully, that answers your question.\n",
      "JANE FRASER (CEO): And in terms of org simplification, culture, the best is still ahead, that is for sure. The org went through a lot. I'm really proud of how people responded. And I think we're really proud of how each of the lines of business are driving the business performance forward. The bank is simpler. There is tremendous transparency for our investors as well as for me. There's much greater proximity to the businesses now. And you can see that the benefits that we're starting to realize from the strategy as we get closer and closer to the Return on Average Tangible Common Equity targets and beyond for each of the businesses. So I'm pleased to have 2024 behind us. I'm proud of what we achieved in 2024. All the focus is on the future. Onwards.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 4, Justification: The answer is evasive as it largely avoids directly addressing key aspects of the questions. Jane Fraser clearly redirects the question about whether the worst of the reorganization is over by stating \"the best is still ahead\" and focusing on future positives rather than the current state of internal challenges. Mark Mason implicitly indicates target changes for 2026, but does not directly confirm if the line of business targets are the *same as last year*, instead focusing on future achievement and overall company targets.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "John McDonald (Analyst): Thank you. Hi Mark, I wanted to ask you about capital optimization levers that you have to you've done, made some good progress in Risk-Weighted Assets mitigation. Is there still some room to go there. And then also, could you maybe increase the pace of Deferred Tax Assets utilization to reduce the Tangible Common Equity density in a way to help the Return on Average Tangible Common Equity goal.\n",
      "Mark Mason (CFO): Yes, sure. So, look, we're always looking at opportunities to further optimize the use of capital. In Markets we've talked about last year a lot about the revenue to Risk-Weighted Assets as a tool that we've been using there. That's continued to increase that metric and ratio. We continue to look at, are we optimizing balance sheet and getting the broader revenue streams we'd expect from our client base, when we do our corporate lending work and some of that is showing up in how we've now introduced the revenue sharing as a tool to ensure we're capturing broader revenues from clients when we are using balance sheet. So, we're constantly working through this and identifying opportunities to ensure we're getting the highest return on that.\n",
      "In fact, as you look through the material we provided, you'll see that in light of the improvement we've seen across all of our businesses last year as well as our forecast for growth this year, there, in fact, is a shift in the Tangible Common Equity. And so, the allocated Tangible Common Equity has gone down for many of these businesses because they have shown good PPNR growth, good profitability. And so, as we stress test it internally, the stressed losses with the businesses have, in fact, come down. Now obviously, we have to adhere to the regulator stress test, and so that shifted from the businesses into Corporate/Other, but it is a positive sign as we think about how the stressed capital buffer might evolve and as we exit different parts of the franchise, the underlying segments are already showing that that improvement would suggest lower levels of stressed losses. And so that's another important point that we diligently manage even if we can't control the impact at the top of the house.\n",
      "Your point around Deferred Tax Assets, we continue to focus on bringing the Deferred Tax Assets down. As you know, that is largely driven by our ability to generate more U.S. income, which we're also very focused on. We did see a pickup this quarter, which is really just a timing difference pickup. It happens in the first quarter of every year. It is tied to deferred compensation and loan loss reserves as timing difference Deferred Tax Assets and as we earn more income through the balance of the year and obviously create income tax liability, it will utilize that increase we saw or offset that that increase we saw in the first quarter here. We are targeting bringing down in 2025 and in 2026 in order to contribute optimizing capital.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 2, Justification: The CFO directly addresses the question about Deferred Tax Assets (DTA) utilization, providing clear targets for reduction in 2025 and 2026. For Risk-Weighted Assets (RWA) mitigation, while not quantifying specific \"room to go,\" he confirms ongoing efforts in capital optimization, referencing continued use of RWA as a tool and other balance sheet optimization strategies. The answer is mostly direct, with minor vagueness regarding the specific extent of future RWA mitigation potential.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Ebrahim Poonawala (Analyst): Understood. And I guess you mentioned, I think, in your prepared remarks, the reserves on the card book went up to 8.2%. Remind us, I mean, I think, and the genesis of both questions is I think there's a fragility to your Return on Average Tangible Common Equity guidance for next year that I think makes investors nervous. And I'm just trying to get to the pieces around buybacks? And then in terms of credit, like how what's it baking in around the unemployment rate? What would cause you to ratchet up provisioning in the near term? What kind of an implied job market deterioration do we need to see for the credit outlook to deteriorate fast and materially? Thanks.\n",
      "Mark Mason (CFO): Yes. Let me take that in a couple of different pieces. So, the first thing I'd say is that as I look at our credit exposure and I look at the consumer, the consumer continues to be resilient and discerning in their spend. And in fact, we did see spend hold up in the quarter, and we saw spend actually increase in our Branded Cards portfolio, up about 3%. The consumer has - we've seen a shift towards essentials and away from travel and entertainment. There's certainly a general performance that's consistent with what we've expected when we look at delinquencies, when we look at the loss rates that played to through the quarter, there are no surprises there as we think about that.\n",
      "Jane Fraser (CEO): And April is performing in line with that as well.\n",
      "Mark Mason (CFO): Thank you. Yes. And April has been consistent that.\n",
      "As we think about reserves, we ended the quarter at about $23 billion of reserves across the entire business. That's about a 2.7% reserve-to-loan ratio.\n",
      "When I look at the drivers of that, as you know, when we establish when we do our [Current Expected Credit Losses] analysis on a quarterly basis, we have three scenarios that we run. A host of other stress scenarios, but that inform the [Current Expected Credit Losses] analysis, there are three scenarios, the base case scenario, there's a downside scenario and there's an upside scenario. And as we looked at the macroeconomic outlook and key variables that go into those scenarios, we assumed a deterioration in that macro-outlook. And we increased the probability or the weighting towards the downside scenario in light of what we were seeing in the macro environment.\n",
      "When you look through to some of the of the key variables, or one variables you referenced, unemployment, the average unemployment rate was 5.1% across those three scenarios. The unemployment rate in the downside scenario, the average was 6.7% across those eight quarters. And so, we've assumed some pretty meaningful shifts in unemployment, particularly on that downside our analysis.\n",
      "That informed the increase in our Allowance for Credit Losses reserves that's referenced in the deck. And that increase was offset a bit by the sequential reduction in volumes that is somewhat seasonal. So hopefully, that helps. We feel good about those reserves based on what we know and our current view of the macroeconomic environment, and we'll obviously do that on a quarterly basis as things continue to evolve.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 4, Justification: The response directly addressed one aspect of the question by providing the unemployment rate assumptions baked into their credit models. However, it completely ignored the analyst's core concern regarding the fragility of the Return on Average Tangible Common Equity guidance for next year and the role of buybacks. While details on current credit provisioning assumptions were provided, the response did not clearly articulate what specific future deterioration or trigger points would lead to a further increase in provisioning.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Erika Najarian (Analyst): Hi, good afternoon. Just a follow-up question here on the buyback pacing. Your message has been pretty clear about the first half versus the second half. That said, with the stock at $65 versus tangible book at $90, I guess, are you just so scared from the volatility of the SCB result that, that just must be hurdle before you can accelerate the buyback? And Mark, perhaps if you could sort of dispel some of the notion that sometimes happens in some of these chats with buy-siders about your inability to dividend from the bank sub to the holding company in order to increase your buybacks over the near term. If you could address that, too, that would be great.\n",
      "Mark Mason (CFO): Yes, sure. So, look, we have accelerated the pace of buybacks. And I think this quarter is a good example where I had guided for $1.5 billion, and we kicked it up to $1.75 billion. And I think you should expect that as we see opportunities to continue to do that, then we're going to do it. And you should expect that given where we are trading relative to book value that we're constantly focused on those opportunities to take it up more than we had planned or more than expected.\n",
      "Look, I think we are, we have seen a lot of volatility in the SCB. And we're not the only ones. Other players in the industry have as well. I think we're encouraged by the dialogue that we're hearing, but there is still some risk to the SCB coming in different this year versus last year. And I think, I don't think we should lose sight. We're not losing sight of that. So, we'll get more clarity when the SCB comes, I think that will be important. We obviously are generating good earnings quarter after quarter, which obviously creates the capacity for us to do more here. And I think we've evidenced a willingness to do that.\n",
      "I think in terms of your other question with regard, your question implying whether there are any restrictions. We don't have any restrictions on the buybacks. We would not have announced a $20 billion buyback program if we didn't think we could execute the program in a reasonable amount of time. And so obviously, we disclosed what we dividend out from the bank, and you can look at that over the last three years, we've dividend somewhere in the range of $0 to $5 billion in any given quarter.\n",
      "But again, there are no restrictions imposed by the Federal Reserve Board, which governs the parent on the ability to pay dividends and buy back stock. In addition to that, we have multiple sources of funding, including loans to subsidiaries, which could be remitted as well as debt issuance programs as well as the earnings that are generated that put - we are well positioned to do, to execute on the program that we've described and to continue our desired pace of buybacks.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 2, Justification: The CFO directly addresses and dispels the notion of dividend restrictions, providing a clear explanation. While acknowledging SCB volatility as a risk, he does not explicitly confirm or deny it as the singular hurdle preventing further buyback acceleration, instead emphasizing current acceleration and ongoing opportunities, which is a minor deflection from the specificity of that part of the question.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Betsy Graseck (Analyst): Okay. Excellent. And then, Jane, just separately, on Slide 2, you identify the main priorities for 2025 and 2026, many of which we've talked about here this call. I just wanted to understand from your perspective on the transformation, how far along do you feel you are in the modernizing your infrastructure? And what kind of time frame do we have to go from here to check the box on that one, if you ever can check the box. And then separately on the Commercial Banking segment, if you could just give us some insights there, too.\n",
      "Jane Fraser (CEO): Okay. There's a lot in there. So, as you remember, the transformation is a very large body of work. We're overhauling our infrastructure. We're reducing and modernizing our applications. We're simplifying our processes. And so, we're addressing the different root causes of what held us back, thoroughly and once and for all. And I feel good about the progress we've made. We're seeing more and more of the benefit into how we run bank.\n",
      "As you know, we fell behind in data, particularly regarding regulatory reporting. We've taken action to get that into shape, and we're confident in how that's now progressing. In many parts, the risk management compliance programs, we're already operating at or close to the target state.\n",
      "So, our focus is now ensuring we're delivering the risk reductions and the outcomes in a sustainable way. And I'm excited about the work we've been doing in making sure that our technology and our overall control environment is what we call modern and simple. We're simplifying and standardizing controls across common activities. We've put a lot more preventative and detective controls in place. We're upgrading others that weren't effective enough. We're driving automation. We're driving straight-through processing of our end-to-end processes across the bank. And you've heard us talk pretty consistently over the last couple of years about the work to make the technology infrastructure onto consolidating on to single platforms, retiring legacy applications.\n",
      "So, I'd say where we are as many of the efforts are now impacting how we run the bank better and more efficiently and in a much more controlled way. There's still work to do. And as you say, I'm not sure any bank finishes its modernization because the pace of innovation is there. And we're still innovating and investing in supporting our businesses, with new innovations in different areas. Talk briefly about Artificial Intelligence, a lot of work in Services there, U.S. Personal Banking and Andy in Wealth. So, there's a lot going on. I think you can tell I'm pretty excited about it. I'm pleased where we're headed and at the pace we're heading.\n",
      "I forgot to do the Commercial Bank side. We can come back to it. Sorry, Betsy, I forgot to mention the Commercial Bank in my enthusiasm on our modernization efforts.\n",
      "Look, I think we are positioned to be the go-to bank for commercial clients. So, these are ones with cross-border needs.\n",
      "We've got these unique capabilities that, particularly the born-digital clients who are then going global very quickly, they can just sit on top of our existing capabilities in Services. And we help them go global. Then we help them think about their IPO or Mergers & Acquisitions or financing opportunities and the banking wallet builds on top of it.\n",
      "We've got quite a unique value proposition. I've been very pleased to see the growth we've been seeing in acquiring new companies, who will be the future major players as they grow in global economies. And this is happening in many of the big bright spots around the world. It's in India. It's in Australia. It's happening in Japan. It's happening through Europe as well as in North America. So, a lot of good future growth activities there, good returns.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 4, Justification: The CEO provides extensive detail on the ongoing modernization efforts and expresses positive sentiment regarding progress. However, they directly avoid quantifying how far along the company is in the transformation and do not provide a specific time frame for its completion, instead framing it as a continuous process. While the Commercial Banking question is answered more directly, the lack of specificity on the core modernization queries makes the overall response evasive.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Gerard Cassidy (Analyst): Hi Jane, Hi Mark. Mark, you touched on in your opening comments about the seasonal increase in trading-related assets. And then the growth was very strong. Was there any types of strategies that you guys employed? Because when you go back in other seasonal periods, first quarter of prior years, we've not seen this kind of growth. So, what led to this kind of success of growing your trading assets so well this quarter?\n",
      "Mark Mason (CFO): Yes. Again, it's the growth you've seen across the platform in both fixed income as well as equities and so that equities growth of 23% strong performance in derivatives in prime and prime balance growth tied to that particularly with hedge funds and asset managers as they looked at regional reallocation, strong contribution there. And then, rates and currencies, good increased client activity in portfolio trading. And then, we saw a lot of good spread product momentum driven by higher client activity and loan growth. And so, the nature of the activity, the structure of the products and what have you were all contributing factors there. Really strong performance across the business. And it obviously shows up in both the assets and the – the trading assets and the trading liabilities and the funding mechanisms associated with that.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 4, Justification: The answer identifies areas of strong performance and attributes it to increased client activity and regional reallocation, but it avoids detailing specific strategies employed by the bank as asked. It also does not directly address why this quarter's growth was unique compared to prior seasonal periods, instead providing a general description of market segments and vague concluding remarks.\n",

      "Obviously, capital is more than that, but – and we did a little bit of buyback this quarter. We're going to wait and see.\n",
      "We don't mind keeping our powder dry, and you've seen us do that with investment portfolios, and we're also going to do that with capital.\n",
      "Steven Chubak (Analyst): That's great. I'll hop back into the queue. Thanks so much for taking my questions.\n",
      "Jamie Dimon (CEO): Okay.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 2, Justification: The CEO initially refers to a penciled-in amount but then directly addresses the analyst's concern about macro uncertainties. By stating, \"We're going to wait and see. We don't mind keeping our powder dry,\" he clearly communicates a cautious appetite for buybacks given current conditions, mostly addressing the question's underlying intent.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Erika Najarian (Analyst): Hi. Good morning. My first question is you mentioned that your reserve build was driven mostly by worse economic assumptions.\n",
      "I'm wondering if you could update us on what unemployment rate you're assuming in your reserve.\n",
      "Jeremy Barnum (CFO): Yeah. So, Erika, as you know, we take – not going to go into a lot of detail here – but we take the outlook from our economists, we run a bunch of different scenarios and we probability-weight those.\n",
      "The central case outlook from our research team hasn't actually changed, but we felt that in line with what Jamie just said in terms of a little bit of tightening as a result of the events of March, it made sense to add a little bit of weight to our relative adverse case.\n",
      "So we did that, which changed the weighted-average expectation. And I think that the weighted-average peak unemployment that we're using now is something like 5.8%.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 2, Justification: The executive directly answers the core of the question by providing a specific number for the weighted-average peak unemployment rate (5.8%). While there is some preliminary explanation of their modeling process and a slight imprecision in the phrasing (\"I think,\" \"something like\"), the question is clearly addressed.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Saul Martinez (Analyst): Got it. Just wanted to clarify that. And then I guess, secondly, on wealth management. The net new assets are pretty impressive then they trend, $16.5 billion, I think, something like 11% of beginning period of client assets over the last couple of quarters. So, it seems like Andy is really delivering there. Just anything in strength across the different products, but anything you want to highlight there as to what's driving that? And any comments just on the durability of that kind of momentum?\n",
      "Jane Fraser (CEO): Look, the strategy that Andy has laid out and talked about is working. We've got the franchise very focused around net new investment assets, bringing those in from the $5 trillion of assets that are off us with existing clients, as well as new wealth that that is being created and new clients we're bringing to the franchise. And so, I'm very pleased as well with the caliber of the team that he has brought to bear here. We've got real horsepower and firepower in our investment capabilities. And he is also investing to improve client experience, a new relationship with Palantir here as well. And it's a team that's on the front foot. And in this environment, around the world, clients are really looking to us for advice because there are not many global wealth managers. They're looking to us for a global perspective, the capabilities we've got on the ground all around the globe and helping put them into good position amidst the uncertainty. So, we are a destination of choice right now, and we're taking full advantage of it. I don't see that changing. This is the strength of Citi. The strategy is working.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 3, Justification: The CEO acknowledges the positive momentum and attributes it to the overall strategy, team, and client focus, also commenting on durability. However, the answer remains high-level and generic, largely avoiding specifics on what is driving the strength 'across the different products' as the analyst inquired, only partially addressing the question's nuances.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Matt O’Connor (Analyst): Okay. And then just any way to frame how much cost will go up from 1Q to 2Q based on what you're thinking there?\n",
      "Mark Mason (CFO): I'm not giving second quarter guidance kind of beyond what I've factored into the full year at this stage.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 4, Justification: The CFO directly refused to provide the specific second-quarter cost guidance requested by the analyst, stating they are not giving guidance beyond the full-year outlook. While the refusal is direct, it is a clear avoidance of the specific numerical information the question sought.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Gerard Cassidy (Analyst): Very good. And then as a quick follow-up, you guys gave us good details about the allocation of equity. I think it was Slide 23. I was curious, I noticed that you've lowered some. The total equity doesn't change, of course, but you did lower the allocation of the equity for different lines like Wealth and Banking. What was the thinking behind lowering it in the first quarter relative to 2024?\n",
      "Mark Mason (CFO): Yes. So, as you probably know, Gerard, we kind of look at this on an annual basis. It's a process that we run, and we run it at the end of the year with an eye towards how we want to make adjustments in the year that's following.\n",
      "As we looked at the performance of the business, overall, our five businesses have improved their PPNR and their profitability and therefore, improving their resiliency in stress scenarios and reducing their stress losses. And so, as we thought about that that underlying strength we saw as well as our forecast for what demand would be through 2025, those were important factors in that allocation or that attribution to the businesses for Tangible Common Equity.\n",
      "So, in a way, they're getting the benefit of that improved resiliency even before it shows up in our Stress Capital Buffer, right? And so, each of the businesses, we talked about Markets as a great example. We've been talking about optimizing use of capital, revenue to Risk-Weighted Assets, and the improvement all last year. We talked about that. And you see that showed up in their performance, but also showed up therefore, in the amount of Tangible Common Equity allocation that they have this year.\n",
      "So hopefully, that helps. Obviously, regulatory capital hasn't changed in the aggregate, that's comprised of the Risk-Weighted Assets, Global Systemically Important Banks and Stress Capital Buffers. But over time, we'd expect, as we've talked about our strategy, we'd expect exits to obviously continue to come off the balance sheet, and we'd expect our strategy and the resiliency of our PPNR and the steadiness of those earnings to ultimately show up in our Stressed Capital Buffer.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 2, Justification: The CFO directly addresses the 'thinking behind' the capital allocation changes. The response explains that improved business performance, profitability, and resiliency reduce stress losses, which in turn influences the capital allocation to specific segments. While not providing precise numerical details for each segment's reduction, the answer clearly outlines the strategic rationale that led to the observed adjustments.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "John McDonald (Analyst): Okay. And then I wanted to ask Jamie – there's a narrative out there that the industry could see a credit crunch – banks are going to stop lending, even Jay Powell mentioned that as a risk.\n",
      "Do you see that in terms of anything you look at in terms of lending and is that a reaction that makes sense – that banks might be retrenching a lot here? Do you worry about that for the economy in terms of credit crunch? Thanks.\n",
      "Jamie Dimon (CEO): Yeah. I wouldn't use the word credit crunch if I were you.\n",
      "Obviously, there's going to be a little bit of tightening, and most of that will be around certain real estate things.\n",
      "And you've heard it from real estate investors already, so I just look at that as a kind of thumb on the scale.\n",
      "It just makes the Fed's conditions be a little bit tighter, it increases the odds of a recession – that's what that is. It's not like a credit crunch.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 2, Justification: Jamie Dimon directly addresses the core concern about lending and the economy, even though he rejects the analyst's specific term 'credit crunch'. He substitutes it with 'tightening' and explains its implications, specifically mentioning 'certain real estate things' and linking it to increased recession odds, thereby mostly addressing the question with a rephrased perspective.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Ken Usdin (Analyst): Yeah, and as a follow-up on the point about rate expectations coming now in, and potentially getting cut sooner – how do you take a look at what that might mean just for the broader economy?\n",
      "Do you think it's more just because inflation's coming down? Do you think it's because the Fed's just got to react to an even tougher economy and still some of those storm clouds that might be out there?\n",
      "Just kind of your general thinking about the other read-throughs of what lower rates quicker will mean for the broader economy.\n",
      "Jamie Dimon (CEO): Well first of all, I don't quite believe it.\n",
      "So the Fed has the rate curve, the forward short-term rate curve, almost at 1% higher than what the market has.\n",
      "So one of the things you got to always prepare for is – it could be anything, we don't know what the rate curve is going to be in a year. And so we're quite cautious in that and quite thoughtful about that.\n",
      "Obviously, the short-term read is higher recessionary risk and then inflation coming down.\n",
      "So I think inflation will come down a little bit, but it could easily be stickier than people think and therefore, the rate curve will have to go up a little bit.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 4, Justification: The CEO avoids the core of the question by immediately stating he doesn't \"quite believe it,\" referring to the premise of rates being cut sooner. While briefly acknowledging a \"short-term read\" of recessionary risk and inflation coming down, he primarily uses the answer to express his skepticism about the market's rate expectations and discuss alternative scenarios, thus sidestepping a comprehensive discussion of the economic implications under the analyst's hypothetical.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Steven Chubak (Analyst): So, Jamie, I was actually hoping to get your perspective on how you see the recent developments with SVB impacting the regulatory landscape for the big banks.\n",
      "In your letter you spent a fair amount of time highlighting the consequences of overly stringent capital requirements, the risk of steering more activities to the less regulated nonbanks.\n",
      "But what are some of the changes that you're scenario planning for – whether it's higher capital, increase in Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation assessment fees? And along those same lines, how you're thinking about the buyback given continued strong capital build, but a lot of macro uncertainty at the moment.\n",
      "Jamie Dimon (CEO): Well, I think you were already kind of complete with answering your own question there.\n",
      "Look, we're hoping that everyone just takes a deep breath and looks at what happened and the breadth and depth of regulations already in place.\n",
      "Obviously, when something happens like this, you should adjust, think about it.\n",
      "So I think down the road there may be some limitations on held-to-maturity, maybe more TLAC for certain type-size banks, and more scrutiny on interest rate exposure, and stuff like that.\n",
      "But it doesn't have to be a revamp of the whole system, just recalibrating things the right way.\n",
      "And I think it should be done knowing what you want the outcome to be.\n",
      "The outcome you should want is very strong community and regional banks.\n",
      "And certain actions are taken which are drastic – it could actually make them weaker. So, that's all it is.\n",
      "We do expect higher capital from Basel IV, effectively and, obviously there's going to be an Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation assessment – that'll be what it is.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 3, Justification: The CEO partially addresses the regulatory impact by acknowledging potential changes like Basel IV capital, FDIC assessments, and increased scrutiny on held-to-maturity portfolios. However, a significant part of the analyst's multi-part question, specifically regarding the firm's stance on buybacks, is completely ignored. The initial comment also subtly deflects the question.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Ken Usdin (Analyst): Hey, thanks. Good morning. Hey, Jeremy, I was just wondering if you can just give us a little bit more detail on those lower funding expectation points that you made, just in terms of is it because of what you can offer the client that might allow you to kind of keep that beta lower?\n",
      "And maybe you can just kind of wrap it into what your overall beta expectations are in that revised update? Thank you.\n",
      "Jeremy Barnum (CFO): Yeah, sure. So let me just summarize the drivers of the change in the outlook.\n",
      "So the primary driver really is lower deposit rate paid expectations across both consumer and wholesale, which, as you mentioned, is driven by a couple factors.\n",
      "So, the change in the rate environment, with cuts coming sooner in the outlook, all else equal, does take some pressure off the reprice.\n",
      "And as you said, we're getting a lot of positive feedback from the field on our product offerings.\n",
      "The short-term CD, in particular, is really getting a lot of positive feedback from our folks in the branches. It's been very attractive to yield-seeking customers. So that's kind of working well.\n",
      "And then on the asset side, we are seeing a little bit higher Card revolve, which is helping.\n",
      "And I'll just remind you that at a conference in February, I suggested that we were already starting to feel like some of the uncertainties we mentioned when giving the guidance had started all moving in the same direction, and that was one of the things that contributed to the upward revision, like all of the uncertainty kind of went the same way.\n",
      "But as Jamie's pointed out – those uncertainties are all still there, we highlight them on the page, and as we look forward to this year and to next year and the medium-term we remain very focused on those.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 3, Justification: The CFO provides a clear and detailed explanation of the drivers behind the lower funding expectations, including the impact of product offerings, directly addressing a significant part of the question. However, the answer entirely omits providing specific overall beta expectations in a revised update, which was an explicit part of the analyst's request.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Ken Usdin (Analyst): Okay. Thank you very much.\n",
      "John McDonald (Analyst): Hi, thanks. Jeremy, wanted to follow up again on the drivers of the Net Interest Income revision and the lower rates paid assumption.\n",
      "You mentioned the Fed cuts coming sooner and positive feedback on the customer offers.\n",
      "What about the March events? Do the bank failures there that happened in March – in your view, do they slow the reprice intensity because folks are moving other than price reasons?\n",
      "Or they intensify it industry-wide because smaller banks have to reprice to keep their deposits? How do those events influence your view of the reprice?\n",
      "Jeremy Barnum (CFO): Yeah. John, it's a really good question, and we've obviously thought about that.\n",
      "But as we sit here today, I guess I have two answers to that.\n",
      "One is it's not meaningfully affecting our current outlook – we don't see it as a major driver.\n",
      "And I think in terms of the larger dynamics that you lay out, it's just a little too early to tell. But from where we are right now, the base case is no real impact.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 1, Justification: The CFO directly addresses both aspects of the analyst's question. They clearly state that the March events are not meaningfully affecting their current outlook and for the broader industry dynamics, they directly say it's 'too early to tell,' providing a clear status of their assessment rather than deflecting.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Gerard Cassidy (Analyst): Sure. And then just as a follow-up, if I heard you correctly, can you give us a little more color – I think you mentioned in building the loan loss reserve this quarter you identified some one-off credits?\n",
      "I don't know if that's how you said it – there's some larger credits. Were they commercial real estate oriented? Were they commercial? Any more color there?\n",
      "Jeremy Barnum (CFO): No, it wasn't commercial real estate. It was just a couple of single name items in the Corporate segment.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 2, Justification: The CFO directly answers the question regarding whether the credits were commercial real estate oriented. They then provide additional context by specifying the 'Corporate segment' and describing them as 'single name items,' which directly addresses the request for more color without being overly vague or evasive. While not hyper-specific, the answer is mostly direct and provides relevant information.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Jim Mitchell (Analyst): No, fair – all fair points. And maybe just a follow-up on John's question on the lending environment. You talked about the industry likely pulling back.\n",
      "Are you changing your underwriting standards in any way? Just trying to think through is there potential for some market share gains given your strength of capital and liquidity? Or how you're thinking about the loan environment?\n",
      "Jamie Dimon (CEO): I'd say very modestly, but we look at that all the time.\n",
      "Jeremy Barnum (CFO): Yeah. And we always say, right, we underwrite through the cycle.\n",
      "And I think notably, we didn't loosen our underwriting standards when all the numbers looked crazy good during the pandemic, and we're not going to overreact now and tighten unreasonably.\n",
      "Some of that correction happens naturally – credit metrics deteriorate for borrowers whether in consumer or wholesale, and that might make them leave our pre-existing risk appetite, but we're not running around aggressively tightening standards right now.\n",
      "Jim Mitchell (Analyst): Okay. Great. Thanks.\n",
      "Gerard Cassidy (Analyst): Thank you. Hi, Jeremy.\n",
      "Jeremy Barnum (CFO): Hey, Gerard.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 3, Justification: The management provides a clear explanation of their underwriting philosophy, stating they are not aggressively tightening standards. However, the answer does not directly address the second part of the question regarding the potential for market share gains, instead focusing on their consistent \"through the cycle\" approach.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Erika Najarian (Analyst): So, as you think about all of what you've just told us – so $81 billion of Net Interest Income this year, and who knows when medium-term is going to happen of mid-70s, the clear strength of the franchise producing 23% ROTCE in a quarter where your Common Equity Tier 1 is 13.8% and a reserve that already reflects 5.8% unemployment.\n",
      "As we think about recession and what JPMorgan can earn in a recession, do you think you can hit 17% ROTCE even in 2024 – assuming we do have a recession in 2024 as everybody is expecting – given all these revenue dynamics and how prepared you are on the reserve?\n",
      "Jeremy Barnum (CFO): Yeah. I mean that's an interesting question, Erika. I guess I'll say a couple things.\n",
      "Jamie Dimon (CEO): It's a great question, so I want to see how Jeremy answers it.\n",
      "Jeremy Barnum (CFO): Okay. Let's take a crack. Let's see what the boss thinks.\n",
      "I think number one, we believe, have said, and continue to believe that this is fundamentally a 17% through the cycle ROTCE franchise, so number one.\n",
      "Number two, as Jamie always says, we run this company for all different scenarios and to have it be as resilient as possible across all different scenarios.\n",
      "On the particular question of ROTCE expectations in 2024 contingent on the particular economic outlook, obviously it depends a lot on the nature of the recession.\n",
      "I think we feel really good about how the company is positioned for a recession, but we're a bank.\n",
      "A very serious recession is of course going to be a headwind for returns, but we think even in a fairly severe recession, we'll deliver very good returns – whether that's 17% or not is too much detail for now.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 5, Justification: The analyst asked a very specific question about hitting a 17% ROTCE in 2024 during a recession. The CFO explicitly stated, \"whether that's 17% or not is too much detail for now,\" directly refusing to provide the requested specific financial outlook. While some general statements about resilience and their through-the-cycle ROTCE target were provided, the core, specific question was clearly avoided.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Gerard Cassidy (Analyst): Thank you.\n",
      "Ebrahim H. Poonawala (Analyst): Hi, good morning. I guess, maybe one question, Jeremy. You reminded us of the relatively low office exposure for JPM. But, obviously, you're big players in the Commercial Real Estate market.\n",
      "Just give us a sense of when you look at the two pressure points on Commercial Real Estate, one, how much is oversupply – and that probably goes beyond office into apartments – how much of a issue is oversupply in the market as we think about the next few years going into a weakening economy?\n",
      "And how much of a risk is higher for longer rates in that if the central banks can't cut rates in the next year or two, we will see a ton of more pain because of the re-fi wall that's coming up?\n",
      "Jeremy Barnum (CFO): Yeah, so Ebrahim let me sort of respond narrowly in connection with our portfolio and our exposure, right?\n",
      "So, really, the large majority of our commercial real estate exposure is multi-family lending in supply constrained markets.\n",
      "And I think it's quite important to recognize the difference between that and sort of higher end, higher price point, non-rent controlled, not supply constrained markets.\n",
      "So, our space is really quite different in that respect, and I think that's a big part of the reason the performance has been so good for so long.\n",
      "So, of course, we watch it very carefully and we don't assume that past performance predicts future results here, but I think our multi-family lending portfolio is quite low risk in the scheme of things.\n",
      "Jamie Dimon (CEO): Can I just add also, housing is in short supply in America. It's not massively oversupplied like you saw in 2008.\n",
      "Jeremy Barnum (CFO): Yeah. And then in terms of the office space, as you know, our exposure is quite small.\n",
      "Yes, Jamie, has also mentioned all the re-fi dynamics that you mentioned too are something that the office space is processing one way or the other.\n",
      "Our office exposure is quite modest, very concentrated in Class A buildings in sort of dense urban locations where the return to the office narrative is one of the drivers – is generally in favor of high occupancy.\n",
      "So, again, watching it. There are obviously specific things here and there to pay attention to, but in the scheme of things for us, not a big issue.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 4, Justification: The CFO explicitly states he will respond \"narrowly in connection with our portfolio and our exposure,\" immediately signaling a redirection. The answer primarily focuses on how JPMorgan's specific commercial real estate portfolio is insulated from the broader market pressures of oversupply and higher rates, rather than assessing how much of an issue these are for the market as a whole, which was the core of the analyst's question.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Gerard Cassidy (Analyst): Leverage loan-type items or just regular Corporate credits?\n",
      "Jeremy Barnum (CFO): Regular Corporate credits. I'd rather not get into too much detail...\n",
      "Gerard Cassidy (Analyst): Okay, very good.\n",
      "Jeremy Barnum (CFO): …Gerard. Sorry. Thanks.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 2, Justification: The CFO directly answered the specific choice presented by the analyst's question, identifying the credits as 'Regular Corporate credits'. However, the immediate follow-up statement 'I'd rather not get into too much detail' acts as a pre-emptive deflection, signaling an unwillingness to elaborate further and thus limiting the completeness of the information provided.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Erika Najarian (Analyst): Thank you.\n",
      "Jim Mitchell (Analyst): Hey. Good morning. Maybe just a little bit on the deposit, your thought process there. You've seen some inflows. Why do you think that you lose them going forward?\n",
      "And just maybe talk a little bit about the dynamic in pricing – do you feel like given the inflows, do you see some pricing power for the larger banks?\n",
      "Jeremy Barnum (CFO): Yeah. A couple things there. So, first of all, we don't know. Right? The deposits just came in. We don't know. We're guessing.\n",
      "Number two, the deposits just came in. So, by definition, these are somewhat flighty deposits because they just came into us, so it's prudent and appropriate for us to assume that they won't be particularly stable.\n",
      "Number three, there's a natural amount of internal migration of deposits to money funds so you have to overlay that and that's embedded in our assumptions.\n",
      "And number four, it's a competitive market, and it's entirely possible that people temporarily come to us and then over time decide to go elsewhere.\n",
      "So, for all of those reasons, we're just being realistic about the stickiness of it.\n",
      "Jamie Dimon (CEO): If I add, I would say, categorically, there's no pricing power that the bigger banks have because if you look at the pricing – and we look at pricing sheets all the time – every bank is in a slightly different position and every bank is competing in three-month, six-month, nine-month savings rates.\n",
      "And then you have the online banks, you got treasury bills, you got money market funds. There's no pricing power for the bank, but obviously we all have different franchises and we're all in a slightly different position.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 2, Justification: The response directly addresses the question about pricing power with a clear 'no' and supporting reasons. While the CFO initially states 'we don't know' regarding deposit stickiness, he then provides several specific reasons and assumptions that contribute to their view that the recent inflows may not be stable, thereby mostly addressing the underlying concern about deposit retention.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Gerard Cassidy (Analyst): In your comments about your Common Equity Tier 1 ratio, obviously it came in strong at 13.8%.\n",
      "You've got the Global Systemically Important Banks buffer obviously going up next year, and we have the stress test coming this summer or in June – the results – which maybe will lead to banks, including yours, having a higher Stress Capital Buffer. Where should we think about that Common Equity Tier 1 ratio being by the end of the year, do you think?\n",
      "Jeremy Barnum (CFO): Yeah. So a few things on there, Gerard.\n",
      "So we have previously said that we were targeting 13.5% in the first quarter of 2024 as a function of assuming an unchanged SCB, the increased Global Systemically Important Banks step and operating with a 50-basis-point buffer.\n",
      "So, the point that Jamie made a second ago, in light of the environment, Basel IV, dry powder, you know, who knows how we'll tweak that going forward. But that's still our base case assumption.\n",
      "Specifically on the stress test, contrary to what I've heard some people argue, our ability to predict the SCB ahead of time from running our own process is actually quite limited.\n",
      "And you'll remember last year that even though we did predict an increase, we were off by almost a factor of two in terms of how big it wound up being, and that was a big surprise for the whole industry.\n",
      "So, we want to be quite humble about our ability to predict the SCB.\n",
      "But having said that, for right now we are assuming it will be unchanged. There are some tailwinds in there through the OCI, but we believe there will likely be some offsets and harsher credit shocks in the number, so for planning purposes right now we're assuming flat for SCB, and we'll know soon enough what that actual number is.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 4, Justification: The CFO avoids providing a direct numerical prediction for the Common Equity Tier 1 ratio by the end of the year. While they mention a Q1 2024 base case, they immediately qualify it with future 'tweaks' and extensively discuss the unpredictability of the Stress Capital Buffer, which directly impacts the ratio. This explains why a precise end-of-year figure cannot be given, thereby sidestepping the specific request.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Erika Najarian (Analyst): And so my follow-up question there. Maybe, Jeremy, could you remind us what unemployment rate is embedded in your Allowance for Credit Losses ratio as of the second quarter?\n",
      "Jeremy Barnum (CFO): Yeah. It’s still 5.8%.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 1, Justification: The CFO directly and clearly answers the question by providing the specific unemployment rate embedded in the Allowance for Credit Losses ratio. There is no vagueness or attempt to avoid the requested information.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "John McDonald (Analyst): Okay. And there's some room for buybacks?\n",
      "Jeremy Barnum (CFO): It's unlikely, obviously. That would be an unlikely outcome.\n",
      "John McDonald (Analyst): Okay. Thank you.\n",
      "Jeremy Barnum (CFO): Sorry, John. Go ahead. Did you have a follow-up?\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 1, Justification: The CFO's response directly answers the analyst's question about room for buybacks by stating it is \"unlikely.\" The answer is clear, specific, and fully addresses the query without any deflection or vagueness.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Vivek Juneja (Analyst): Jane, sharing about all turmoil and reading some new stories about mandates being shifted from U.S. broker-dealers to local players. Jane, are you concerned about that? Is that a shift that's starting outside the U.S. for big players like yourselves and others who are widespread globally, does this start to create stronger competitors or move some business away over time?\n",
      "Jane Fraser (CEO): No, it doesn't. We haven't seen any shifts of business away from us. And just remember the nature of our business. These are many of these markets around the world we've been in for over a century. We were the first bank in, sometimes we're the only international bank in, and we truly have a unique footprint that we are everywhere, and we're able to connect everything everywhere, and there aren’t other banks that have this. They don’t have the scale, they don't have the depth of local capabilities. They don't have the risk management skills. You don't have all of these different elements that the clients need now.\n",
      "And they need in this type of environment where things are shifting around. It's very easy to move your supply chains around on our platform, to shift the mix of different businesses. You're doing different geographies you're in. And as I said, a lot of the work we do is very local, and we're at the cutting-edge leading edge, in Services, both in Treasury and Trade Solutions, custody, in particular, our corporate bankers have got very strong, deep relationships. We've got balance sheet strength. So, you tend to see flights to quality in these environments.\n",
      "And when you're in the emerging markets, there is only one word for quality, and that's Citi.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 2, Justification: The CEO directly answers the analyst's core questions about concern and business shifts with a clear \"No.\" While the subsequent justification relies heavily on general assertions of Citi's unique global footprint and and strength rather than specific market counter-arguments, it still provides a clear stance and explanation for her denial.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Betsy L. Graseck (Analyst): Yeah. Got it. Okay, that's super helpful to understand how you think through that. And then the follow-up is just on the buybacks. So do I take your comments to mean that you're on pause now?\n",
      "And if that's the case, what would be the driver of restarting?\n",
      "Jamie Dimon (CEO): Yeah. No. We're not on pause now. We're doing a little bit now.\n",
      "We obviously have a lot of excess capital. We also like to buy our stock when it's cheap, not just when it's available.\n",
      "And we're also peering ahead, looking at those little bit of storm clouds so we're going to be kind of cautious.\n",
      "So we're going to make this decision every day. We also don't like to tell the market what we're doing, just so you know.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 4, Justification: The CEO directly answers the first part of the question, stating they are not on pause. However, in response to the follow-up about drivers of restarting, he provides general considerations and then explicitly states, \"We also don't like to tell the market what we're doing, just so you know,\" which is a clear avoidance of providing specific future guidance or triggers for buybacks.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Ebrahim H. Poonawala (Analyst): Got it. Very helpful. Thank you.\n",
      "Mike Mayo (Analyst): Hey Jeremy, you mentioned a degree of reintermediation to the lending markets. You said capital markets activity has gone to bank lending, and I'm just wondering, as part of your $7 billion increased Net Interest Income guide, are you assuming better loan spreads?\n",
      "And on the topic of loan pricing, why aren't your credit card yields going higher than where they are today? Thanks.\n",
      "Jeremy Barnum (CFO): Yeah, Mike. So I think, yeah, you're referring to my comments that I made in the Commercial Bank about the fact that the larger Corporate segment within the Commercial Bank that would generally have access to capital markets but also access to bank lending, at the margin is choosing to draw down revolvers right now rather than access the capital markets.\n",
      "That is not a particularly meaningful driver of the increase in Net Interest Income guidance. There's a lot of odds and ends in there, but the major drivers are the ones that I called out.\n",
      "And to be honest, I haven't actually specifically checked what's happening with Card yields. I would imagine that they've gone up a little bit in line with rates, but I don't know. We should follow up here.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 2, Justification: The CFO directly addressed the first part of the question by stating that reintermediation was not a meaningful driver of the Net Interest Income guidance. For the second part, he explicitly admitted he had not checked the credit card yields and did not know why they weren't higher, which is a direct admission of lack of information rather than an evasive maneuver. While not providing the full desired information for the second part, the answer was not vague or deflective.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Mike Mayo (Analyst): Hey Jamie, your CEO letter said the banking crisis isn't over. So, what do you mean by that? Or was that dated two weeks later? Are you talking contagion or what?\n",
      "Jamie Dimon (CEO): Yeah. So it's just – the number of banks offsides you can count on your hands, in terms of too much interest rate exposure, too much Automated Teller Machine, too much uninsured deposits.\n",
      "And so there may be additional bank failures, something like that, which we don't know.\n",
      "But you're going to see next week regional banks have pretty good numbers. A lot of people are going to have – can take – actions to remediate some of the issues they may have going forward.\n",
      "You've already seen things calm down quite a bit, particularly in deposit flows.\n",
      "Warren Buffett was on TV talking about that he would bet $1 million – I don't know if you saw that – that no depositor will lose money in America. That he's willing to bet his own money.\n",
      "And of course, you know he's a very bright man.\n",
      "So, this crisis is not 2008. It will pass.\n",
      "And the one thing I pointed out is, when I answered the question just before about interest rates – people need to be prepared. They shouldn't pray that they don't go up. They should prepare for them going up. And if it doesn't happen, serendipity.\n",
      "Mike Mayo (Analyst): All right. Thank you.\n",
      "Jamie Dimon (CEO): Yeah.\n",
      "Betsy L. Graseck (Analyst): Hi. Good morning.\n",
      "Jeremy Barnum (CFO): Hey, Betsy.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 2, Justification: The CEO directly addresses what he meant by the banking crisis not being over, specifying issues like excessive interest rate exposure and uninsured deposits. He also provides context on why additional failures might occur and contrasts the current situation with 2008, implicitly addressing the 'contagion' aspect. While the tone shifts to a more reassuring outlook than his initial letter, the answer largely clarifies his original statement.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Glenn Schorr (Analyst): Interesting. Just follow-up, the other thing that caught my eye in the letter is you mentioned that you're exploring new capital optimization strategies including partnerships and securitizations.\n",
      "What's different than what you've already been doing for the last 30 years?\n",
      "Jamie Dimon (CEO): We've got our smartest people, we’re going to figure out every angle to reduce capital requirements for JPMorgan. That's the difference.\n",
      "And we've been doing it, but there's securitizations, there are partnerships.\n",
      "You're seeing a lot of the private equity do the life insurance companies, and I expect that we're going to come up with a whole bunch of different things over time. And we'll shed certain assets, too.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 4, Justification: The CEO's answer emphasizes that they are actively working to reduce capital requirements and will \"come up with a whole bunch of different things over time.\" However, it fails to directly address the analyst's core question of what is *different* about these strategies compared to what the firm has been doing for the last 30 years. The response is general and focuses on future intent rather than providing specific distinctions.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Matt O'Connor (Analyst): Okay. And then just separately to squeeze in – you guys took some securities losses again this quarter. And in the past you've talked about really just going security-by-security looking for, kind of, pricing opportunities. Is that kind of what drove it again this quarter, or is there some kind of broader, overarching…\n",
      "Jamie Dimon (CEO): That'll be every quarter for the rest of our lives. Sell what we find rich, and we buy what we think is dear...\n",
      "Jeremy Barnum (CFO): Cheap.\n",
      "Jamie Dimon (CEO): Cheap.\n",
      "Matt O'Connor (Analyst): Okay. All right. Thank you.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 4, Justification: The CEO's response provided a general explanation of their ongoing trading strategy rather than specifically addressing the drivers for the security losses this quarter or confirming/denying a 'broader, overarching' reason. By stating 'That'll be every quarter for the rest of our lives,' he generalizes the activity, thereby sidestepping the specific nuance of the question regarding the current quarter's drivers.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Mike Mayo (Analyst): All right. And then one for you, Jamie. I guess taking the 10,000 foot level, I guess, when you look at asset liability management, or ALM – you could call this nightmare on ALM street, and you've seen some big problems at banks, and I guess how would you evaluate yourself, I guess, with this $7 billion higher Net Interest Income guide?\n",
      "It probably is good, but to what degree are you willing to sacrifice JPM shareholder money to help rescue problem banks that did not get their asset liability management correctly?\n",
      "Jamie Dimon (CEO): Well, it's two really different questions. So we've been quite cautious on interest rates for quite a while, and how we invest our portfolio, what our expectations are, our stress testing.\n",
      "The stress test – the Comprehensive Capital Analysis stress test, as you know, had rates going down. I always looked at rates going up and being prepared – whether or not anything is going to happen.\n",
      "So we've been quite conservative ourselves and we don't mind continuing to do that because I remind people that having excess capital, you haven't lost it.\n",
      "It's kind of earnings in store – you get to deploy it later and maybe at a more opportune time, when the time comes.\n",
      "And look, we like to help the system when it needs help, if we can reasonably. And we're not the only ones, you saw a lot of banks do that, and I was proud of them. I think all of us did the right thing.\n",
      "Whether ultimately it works out or not, well, you could second-guess that when it happens. But the fact is, I think people want to help the system.\n",
      "And this whole banking thing was bad for banks. And I knew that the second I saw the headline, and then you had Credit Suisse.\n",
      "We want healthy community banks. We want healthy regional banks. We want to help them get through this.\n",
      "We have, you'll remember, Mike, as you point out, we have the best financial system the world's ever seen.\n",
      "That does not mean it won't have problems, doesn't mean there shouldn't be changes made, but I think it's reasonable for people to help each other in times of need.\n",
      "And we all did that – all of us – did that during COVID. All of us did that – if you could, those who could – did it during the Great Financial Crisis, and I would expect people to do that going forward.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 4, Justification: The CEO directly addressed the first part of the question regarding JPM's own asset liability management and conservative strategy. However, he largely avoided the second, more pointed question about the 'degree' of willingness to 'sacrifice JPM shareholder money' to rescue other banks. Instead, he generalized about the importance of helping the system and referred to historical instances of inter-bank cooperation, without quantifying or directly acknowledging the potential financial cost to JPM shareholders.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Ebrahim H. Poonawala (Analyst): And just as a follow up, I think the other risk from higher for longer rates, I think, is this – the ability of the economy, the financial markets to sustain a 5% less Fed fund for a long period of time?\n",
      "Like, what are the other areas you're watching if duration mismatch and bank balance sheets being one, Commercial Real Estate market being one, are you worrying – worried about non-banks that have grown exponentially over the last decade in terms of risks at the non-banks if rates don't get cut?\n",
      "And if you can talk to the transmission mechanism of that coming back and hitting banks given the leverage that banks provide to the non-banks.\n",
      "Jamie Dimon (CEO): Yeah, so I'd like to answer that. So there is a risk of higher rates for longer.\n",
      "And don't just think of just the Fed Funds rate, because I think you should – for our planning – I'd be thinking more about it could be 6%.\n",
      "And then think about the five- and ten-year rate which could be 5%, and I think if those things happen – I'm not saying they're going to happen – I just think people should prepare for them, they saw what just happened when rates went up beyond people's expectations.\n",
      "You had the gilt problem in London, you had some of the banks here. People need to be prepared for the potential of higher rates for longer.\n",
      "If and when that happens, it will undress problems in the economy for those who are too exposed to floating rates, for those who are too exposed to re-fi risk.\n",
      "Those exposures will be in multiple parts of the economy. I say to all of our clients – now would be the time to fix it.\n",
      "Do not put yourself in a position where that risk is excessive for your company, your business, your investment pools, et cetera. That's answer number one.\n",
      "Number two is, it will not come back to JPMorgan. Okay? While we do provide credit to what you call shadow banks, it is very – we think – it's very, very secure.\n",
      "That does not mean it won't come back to other credit providers.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 4, Justification: The CEO directly addresses J.P. Morgan's secure position regarding 'shadow banks' but largely avoids explaining the 'transmission mechanism' of how potential risks from non-banks could broadly impact other banks, which was a specific part of the question. A significant portion of the answer is also general advice about preparing for higher rates rather than identifying other specific areas of concern as requested.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Betsy L. Graseck (Analyst): Okay. So I just wanted to unpack the higher for longer rate possibility as to how it impacts your Net Interest Income because your Net Interest Income guide is assuming the forward curve, if I understand correctly.\n",
      "So, in the event that you get that higher for longer, just how much does that impact Net Interest Income ex. Markets because I'm trying to triangulate here about – maybe you lose some deposits, but if we have higher for longer, shouldn't we expect the trajectory goes up from this quarter as opposed to down? Is that – that's the question.\n",
      "Jamie Dimon (CEO): Go ahead, Jeremy. And then I'll go.\n",
      "Jeremy Barnum (CFO): Sure. So, Betsy, your question is very good.\n",
      "And I would say that if you look at the evolution of our outlook last year, it was pretty clear that we were very asset-sensitive, certainly in terms of the sort of one year forward EaR type measure.\n",
      "You also obviously know that our current EaR actually shows a slight negative number, so a tiny bit liability sensitive, and I won't get into all the nuances about why that may or may not be a great predictor in the short-term.\n",
      "But the point is that the level of rates now is of course very different from what it was last year.\n",
      "And at this level of rates, the relationship between our short-term Net Interest Income evolution and the curve is not always going to be clear in any given moment.\n",
      "It's quite tricky, and it can behave in somewhat wonky ways as a function of, again, what I've alluded to a couple times on this call – the competitive environment for deposits, which is not, in fact, a sort of mathematically predictable thing as a function of the rate curve. So, that's why we're emphasizing all the different drivers of uncertainty in the Net Interest Income outlook. Yeah.\n",
      "Jamie Dimon (CEO): Yeah. So I'll just add, so next quarter we all kind of know already. Two quarters out, we know a little bit less. Three quarters out, we know a little bit less. And 2024, we know very little.\n",
      "That number, you could imagine – this is a little inside baseball now – the number that we're talking about for 2024 is not based upon an implied curve. It's based upon us looking at multiple potential scenarios, leveling them kind of out and saying this is kind of a range.\n",
      "And you're absolutely correct. You could have an environment of higher for longer that might be better than that, but remember, higher for longer comes with a lot of other things attached to it – like maybe a recession, stagflation, lower volumes.\n",
      "So I wouldn't look at that as higher for longer is a positive. It might be a slight positive on that line. It would probably would be a negative on other lines.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 4, Justification: The responses acknowledge the question but largely avoid a direct answer on how a 'higher for longer' scenario specifically impacts Net Interest Income's trajectory. Jeremy emphasizes the complexity and unpredictability of deposit behavior, making a clear prediction difficult. Jamie broadens the discussion to other negative economic impacts that could arise from 'higher for longer,' thereby sidestepping a definitive NII outlook and avoiding a direct answer to the specific NII trajectory question.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Jim Mitchell (Analyst): Okay. But I guess just one follow-up on that. Just if we don't get rate cuts till middle of next year or later, does that sort of give some confidence to the outlook for next year or are you still worried about significant reprice?\n",
      "Jeremy Barnum (CFO): I wouldn't necessarily assume that the evolution from the current run rate into that mid-70s number is that sensitive to the rate outlook in particular. When we put that number out there, we looked at a range of different types of rate environments and the reprice that we think would be associated with that.\n",
      "It was really meant to capture more of what we consider to be a through-the-cycle sustainable number, so I wouldn't think of it as being particularly rate-dependent.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 2, Justification: The CFO directly addresses the core of the question by stating their outlook is not particularly sensitive to the rate outlook and that their projections are meant to be a \"through-the-cycle sustainable number.\" While not a simple yes/no, it clearly explains why the delay in rate cuts wouldn't significantly impact their confidence or reprice concerns, thereby mostly answering the question's underlying premise.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Glenn Schorr (Analyst): Thank you. So you talked about in your letter about regulators avoiding the knee-jerk reaction, which you addressed earlier.\n",
      "I'm curious on your thoughts around how customers have reacted and should react.\n",
      "Now my point, my question is – consumers can move excess cash balances if they want more insurance. They can do that in a lot of different ways: move it, treasuries, money market, extra accounts, whatever.\n",
      "The issue, the question I have for you is on the corporate side. Have you seen big changes in how corporate treasurers or CFOs are adapting their cash balances and working capital – and should they need to? And I appreciate your Warren Buffett comments.\n",
      "Jeremy Barnum (CFO): Yeah, Glenn, in short, we really haven't seen big changes to speak of.\n",
      "And I do think it's just worth saying – I think you're sort of hinting at this a little bit when you talk about the behavior of corporates – that when we talk about responses to the recent events through the lens of uninsured deposits, that's obviously very different if you're talking about large balances of non-operating uninsured deposits from financial institutions or de facto financial institutions versus normal large corporate operating balances, which is, of course, like core banking business for all of us.\n",
      "Jamie Dimon (CEO): When we saw it in Commercial Banking, Payments, Investment Banking and Custody, you did see money move – or I would call excess cash was moved out. But they have options.\n",
      "What I would call more like operational cash – so think even of a small companies, middle market companies, et cetera – that tends to be fairly sticky because you have your loans there, you have your money there, you're getting more and more competitive in rates.\n",
      "And that's why I think you see lot of regional banks – they've got sticky middle market deposits.\n",
      "If I lent you $30 million and you have $10 million, you're probably going to leave it at my bank. And they also are more competitive on the rate for that.\n",
      "So, I think you shouldn't be looking at deposit like one class – there's a whole bunch of different types, and analytically you go through each one and try to figure out what the stickiness is, and what the stickiness is and et cetera and so on.\n",
      "But I think they have already – as the Fed has raised rates, you've already seen – that's the reason we expected outflows both from consumers and corporate customers.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 2, Justification: The CFO directly stated they haven't seen \"big changes,\" and the CEO elaborated by distinguishing between excess and operational cash, explaining that excess cash did move while operational cash remains sticky. This largely addresses both parts of the question, providing a nuanced perspective rather than a simple yes/no, but without truly avoiding the core inquiry.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "John McDonald (Analyst): Okay. That's helpful. And with a number of years for this to phase in and you generating capital at a high level even if the ROTCE comes down a bit, how should we think about your pace of building capital for these new changes versus doing your everyday course of investing and buybacks and things like that over the next couple years?\n",
      "Jeremy Barnum (CFO): Yeah. I mean, I guess I'm sort of tempted to give you our standard capital hierarchy here. I mean, we're not going to sacrifice investments, right? That won't come as a surprise to you.\n",
      "Generally speaking, we're always going to try to comply with new requirements early. So when we know the requirements and when we have visibility, obviously given how much organic capital we're generating right now, whatever the answer winds up being it'll be pretty easy to comply, narrowly speaking.\n",
      "But that's not the same as saying that there won't be consequences to returns or to pricing.\n",
      "And if for whatever reason things aren't exactly as we're anticipating, I don't see us sacrificing investments that we see as strategically critical in order to comply with higher capital requirements ahead of the formal timing or whatever.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 4, Justification: The CFO avoids providing a clear 'pace of building capital' or addressing the impact on 'buybacks,' which were key components of the analyst's question. The response focuses on general statements about not sacrificing investments and complying early, rather than offering specific insights into the balance of capital allocation over the next couple of years.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Ken Usdin (Analyst): That makes sense. And as a follow-up to that, on the Consumer side you mentioned that consumers continue to spend albeit a little more slowly, and you mentioned that consumers are also using their excess deposits a little bit more as well. Can you just elaborate a little bit more on just your feeling about the state of the consumer? And is that Card growth continue to be driven by people needing to revolve as opposed to wanting to have more in their deposits? Just kind of want the trade-off on that side too?\n",
      "Jeremy Barnum (CFO): Yeah. I mean, to us I think we still see this as a normalization, not deterioration story when we talk about consumer credit.\n",
      "Actually, revolve per account has still not gotten to pre-pandemic levels actually, so I would definitely say that it's a wanting rather than needing at least for our portfolio at this point.\n",
      "And, yeah, I think the consumer continues to surprise on the upside here.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 1, Justification: The CFO directly addressed both parts of the analyst's question. He clearly stated their view on the state of the consumer as normalization, not deterioration, and explicitly answered the 'revolve vs. needing/wanting' question by noting that revolve per account is below pre-pandemic levels and driven by 'wanting'.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Betsy L. Graseck (Analyst): Yeah. And then can you give us any sense of what Basel IV endgame means to you in your RWAs? How much should we be baking in for those?\n",
      "Jeremy Barnum (CFO): Yeah, Betsy, we really don't have any new information there, right?\n",
      "I mean, I think clearly if you go back like a year, we were maybe a little bit more optimistic that it might be across all the different levers and all the different pieces of it, closer to capital neutral.\n",
      "I think now it feels like it’s likely to be worse than that. Hopefully, it’s not too much worse than that.\n",
      "And I would just remind you that there are a lot of different levers, so when the NPR comes, that's only going to be a part of it, there's going to be other pieces – the holistic review.\n",
      "And it's going to take a lot of time to phase in and we're going to have time to adjust. So we'll know when we know.\n",
      "Betsy L. Graseck (Analyst): Got it.\n",
      "Jamie Dimon (CEO): And there were supposed – I just remembered, there were supposed to be pauses in there about how they looked at banks relative to the global economy, which are getting smaller.\n",
      "The G-SIFI was supposed to be adjusted for that. So, it may very – we're expecting it go up, but there are a lot of reasons why it shouldn't go up.\n",
      "And JPMorgan – there's so much capital. I mean, so you can't look at JPMorgan and say, well, it's a capital issue.\n",
      "And even the banks, by the way, when you look at it – even though some of the banks that are in trouble, they have plenty of capital. Their issue wasn't capital, it was other things. And so I'm just hoping regulators are very thoughtful.\n",
      "And the other thing is they should a priori decide what they want out of the banking system at this point because I've made it clear – I can look at the banking system and say that no bank should keep a loan, if possible.\n",
      "That's how much capital is now being required for loans.\n",
      "Betsy L. Graseck (Analyst): This is based on the current rule set.\n",
      "Jamie Dimon (CEO): Yeah, because the market is pricing holds. The market would take loans at much lower capital ratio than banks are being forced to hold for them.\n",
      "I'm talking about just loans only. So that's why you're seeing a lot of capital go to – I mean a lot of credit go to non-banks, and dramatically, by the way. Rapidly and dramatically.\n",
      "And so if you're a regulator, you should be looking at it and saying, do I want that? Is that a good thing for the system?\n",
      "If you believe it's a good thing for the system, raise the capital and more credit will go out of the system. That's fine. If that's what they want, that's fine.\n",
      "But they should do it with a forethought, not accidentally.\n",
      "Betsy L. Graseck (Analyst): I like the Net Interest Income from loans better than the gain on sale, so I'll prefer the former not the latter. But thanks, appreciate it.\n",
      "Jamie Dimon (CEO): Yes.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 5, Justification: The answer is very evasive as neither executive provides any specific quantitative estimate for the impact of Basel IV on their RWAs, which was the core of the analyst's question. The CFO explicitly states they have no new information and 'we'll know when we know,' while the CEO extensively redirects the conversation to a broader philosophical discussion about capital regulation and its impact on the banking system at large, completely avoiding the firm-specific 'how much' asked.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Glenn Schorr (Analyst): Yeah. Thanks, Jamie.\n",
      "Matt O'Connor (Analyst): Good morning. You guys talked about one of the drivers of the higher net interest income guide this year is due to likely higher credit card balances.\n",
      "And I was just wondering if you could flush out what changed there on the outlook today versus three months ago. And I guess, is it a good or bad thing that those balances will be higher than you thought?\n",
      "Jeremy Barnum (CFO): Yeah. So the story there is kind of the same story we've been talking about for a while. It's just a matter of degree.\n",
      "So we had revolving balances obviously drop a lot during the pandemic period and then we talked about having them recover in absolute dollar terms to the same level as we'd had pre-pandemic, which I think happened last quarter.\n",
      "And then the remaining narrative is just the further normalization of the revolve per-account, because we also have seen some account growth, and that continues to happen.\n",
      "And so also, to Mike's question earlier, we're seeing a higher yield there as well.\n",
      "So, and on your question of whether it's good or bad, obviously there's a point at which the consumers have too much leverage. We don't see that yet, so.\n",
      "Jamie Dimon (CEO): It's normalization.\n",
      "Jeremy Barnum (CFO): Yeah.\n",
      "Jamie Dimon (CEO): It's a good thing for us.\n",
      "Jeremy Barnum (CFO): Yeah.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 2, Justification: The management clearly explains that the higher credit card balances are due to the continued normalization of revolving balances per account and account growth, stating it's an ongoing trend now happening to a greater degree. They also directly answer the 'good or bad' aspect, clearly stating it is a good thing for them. While the specific *reason* for the change in outlook beyond 'matter of degree' could have been more granular, the core drivers and implications are directly addressed.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "John McDonald (Analyst): Yeah. No, just do buybacks play a role in the next couple years strategically? Do you episodically buy back?\n",
      "Jeremy Barnum (CFO): I mean, capital hierarchy again, right? In the end, when we have nothing else to do with the money, we'll do buybacks.\n",
      "And we talked about the $12 billion for this year. Obviously a lot of new moving parts there. Although all else equal, given what we've done so far, that's still probably a reasonable number for the full year.\n",
      "But, yeah, that's always going to be at the end of the list. But, yeah.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 3, Justification: The CFO provided a general principle about capital allocation and mentioned the current year's buyback plan, but did not specifically address the strategic role of buybacks for the \"next couple years\" or whether they would be done \"episodically,\" which were key parts of the analyst's forward-looking question.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Erika Najarian (Analyst): Thank you.\n",
      "John McDonald (Analyst): Hi. Good morning. Jeremy, wanted to ask about capital in the wake of the Barr speech. We don't have the details yet, but just kind of wanted to ask about options that you have and strategies for mitigation both on Risk-Weighted Assets and potentially on the Global Systemically Important Banks front as well as you contemplate what you heard recently.\n",
      "Jeremy Barnum (CFO): Yeah. Thanks, John. So obviously, we're thinking about that a lot. On the other hand, as much as there have been a lot of very detailed rumors out there that might lead you to start to try to do some planning, it does seem like this time it's real and we are actually going to get a proposal presumably sometime this month or something.\n",
      "So soon enough, we'll get to see something actually on paper and we can stop kind of the guesswork.\n",
      "Having said that, indulging in a little bit of guesswork, it does seem like the biggest single driver of the increase that people are talking about, including Chair Powell's 20% number or Vice Chair Barr’s 2% of Risk-Weighted Assets which winds up being roughly the same, is just the way operational risk is getting introduced into the Standardized pillar.\n",
      "And that is a little bit of a straight-up, across-the-board tax on everything.\n",
      "It's kind of hard to optimize your way out of that, with the exception obviously of the fact that you can simply increase price, assuming you have pricing power, but that's obviously not what we want and that's what we sort of mean by impacts on the real economy.\n",
      "So there are details, there is a lot of the FRTB stuff; we can get way into the weeds there within the Markets business. And we do have a good track record of adjusting and optimizing, but this time around, it may be a more fundamental set of questions around business mix as opposed to the ability to sort of optimize in a very technical way.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 4, Justification: The CFO explicitly states they are waiting for the detailed proposal to be released before they can stop 'guesswork' and formulate concrete strategies. While acknowledging the topic and discussing the likely major driver of the capital increase, the answer directly sidesteps providing any specific 'options' or 'strategies for mitigation' as requested by the analyst, due to the lack of finalized regulatory details.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Mike Mayo (Analyst): Alright, and separate question. I appreciate the Investor Day – gives a little bit more color on the degree that your investments may or may not pan out; we are still all watching that closely.\n",
      "Having said that, you just increased revenue guidance by $10 billion for Net Interest Income between this quarter and the first quarter without changing expense guidance by even $1. Aren't you tempted to spend a little bit more? Why not spend more if you're gaining share?\n",
      "And I'm not saying that you should; I'm just wondering like aren't you tempted to do so? You have $10 billion more revenues and you're not spending $1 more of expenses. Like, why not?\n",
      "Jeremy Barnum (CFO): Mike, let me get this right. You're actually complaining that our expenses aren't high enough? Is that right?\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 5, Justification: The CFO's response is a rhetorical question that reframes the analyst's inquiry as a complaint about low expenses, rather than addressing the strategic rationale for not increasing spending despite higher revenue guidance. It completely avoids the substance of the question about investment temptation and capital allocation.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Betsy L. Graseck (Analyst): I do want to unpack the question here on the possibility of higher for longer rates and how that impacts you in your non-Markets Net Interest Income...\n",
      "Jeremy Barnum (CFO): Betsy, did we just lose you? I feel like you just dropped.\n",
      "Betsy L. Graseck (Analyst): No, hear me? Hello?\n",
      "Jamie Dimon (CEO): Go ahead.\n",
      "Jeremy Barnum (CFO): Yeah. You're back now.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 5, Justification: The management's responses completely avoided the analyst's incomplete financial question regarding the impact of higher rates on non-Markets Net Interest Income. Instead of attempting to address the question or allow it to be fully formed, they changed the topic entirely to a technical connectivity issue, providing no relevant information regarding the financial inquiry.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Ken Usdin (Analyst): Got it. Okay. Thank you.\n",
      "Gerard Cassidy (Analyst): Good morning, Jeremy. Good morning, Jamie. Jeremy, can you give us your view on how you're measuring the treasury functions and the asset liability of your balance sheet as we go forward versus the way you guys were positioning and managing it a year ago in view of the fact that it looks like maybe we're approaching the terminal rate on Fed funds rates?\n",
      "Jeremy Barnum (CFO): Yeah. Gerard, I would say honestly not much changed there actually. We have been pretty consistently concerned about the risk of higher rates. Of course, we always try to position things to produce reasonable outcomes across a broad range of scenarios.\n",
      "But at the margin, we've been biased towards higher rates, and that may be a little less true at these levels than it was before, although a lot of that is just the consequence of deposit convexity playing out in the modeling.\n",
      "But in any case, all else equal, I think we are going to continue to focus on making sure we're fine in a higher rate scenario while staying balanced across a range of scenarios.\n",
      "So not really a lot of change in our positioning, and that's obviously including the fact that we took on First Republic which, even net of some of the liabilities, had a long structural interest rate position. We did not actually want to get longer as part of the deal, and so as a result we took actions to ensure that net-net we are still about the same as we were last quarter.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 2, Justification: The CFO directly stated that 'not much changed' in their approach compared to a year ago, addressing the core of the analyst's question. He explained their consistent bias towards higher rates and how they managed the First Republic acquisition to maintain this positioning, providing relevant context. While not detailing specific measurement techniques, the response clearly articulated their consistent strategic stance.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Jim Mitchell (Analyst): Thanks. Good morning. Hey, Jeremy, you talked about Net Interest Income guidance up. Clearly, Fed Funds futures are up so it makes some sense. But maybe I guess first, could you kind of discuss – I guess comment on deposit behavior broadly around betas and mix and what you're seeing there so far?\n",
      "It seems to be coming in a little better than expected.\n",
      "And then secondly, and probably more importantly, can you help us think about the implications of higher-for-longer rates on the outlook for Net Interest Income next year and beyond? I guess the intermediate term outlook that you guys had talked about?\n",
      "Jeremy Barnum (CFO): Yeah, sure. Thanks, Jim. So, yeah, so when we talk about the drivers of the upward revision, as I said, it's higher rates coupled with lower deposit reprice; hard to untangle the two drivers.\n",
      "And specifically, I think when you look at Consumer, the combination of the passage of time and the positive feedback we're getting from the field and the CD offerings in particular has meant that it's quite a kind of stable environment from that perspective.\n",
      "And similarly, in Wholesale we're just seeing slower internal migrations.\n",
      "You asked about mix. I think that obviously, we're seeing the CD mix increase and we would expect that to continue to take place probably even past the peak of the rate cycle into next year as we continue to capture money in motion.\n",
      "But as you say, the most important point is the fact that, as I said earlier, we don't consider this level of Net Interest Income generation to be sustainable.\n",
      "And we talked previously about a sort of medium-term run rate in the mid-70s. That was before First Republic, and you could argue that maybe that number should be a little higher. But whatever it is, it's a lot lower than the current number.\n",
      "We don't know when that's going to happen. We're not going to predict the exact moment; that's going to be a function of competitive dynamics in the marketplace. But we want to be clear that we do expect it at some point.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 4, Justification: The CFO directly addresses the first part of the question regarding deposit behavior and mix. However, for the second, more important part about the implications of \"higher-for-longer\" rates on the intermediate-term Net Interest Income outlook, the CFO largely evades providing specific guidance. They reiterate that current NII levels are unsustainable but state they \"don't know when that's going to happen\" and won't \"predict the exact moment,\" thus avoiding giving a concrete outlook linked to the higher-for-longer scenario.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "John McDonald (Analyst): Got it. Okay. Thank you.\n",
      "Ken Usdin (Analyst): Thanks. Good morning. I just wanted to ask a little bit about how you're feeling about the trade-off between like the commercial economy and what might come through in terms of future loan growth versus the kind of green shoots that people are talking about in the Investment Banking pipeline and just how it feels in terms of like re-opening of markets and the trade-off between getting some more of those fees in versus what's happening on the loan demand side. Thanks.\n",
      "Jeremy Barnum (CFO): Sure. Good question, Ken. So I think in terms of Investment Banking and Markets, yeah, slightly better than expected last month. What I would talk about green shoots especially in Capital Markets generally, still definitely some headwinds in Mergers & Acquisitions, lower announced activity, some regulatory headwinds there, so we'll see.\n",
      "I think it's a little too early to call a trend there based on recent results, but we'll see.\n",
      "In terms of the broader economy and loan growth expectations, generally, we do still expect reasonably robust Card loan growth. But away from that for a variety of different reasons and different products, whether it be mortgage or C&I after revolver normalization, and especially if we see a little bit of a cooling off of the economy, I would expect loan demand to be relatively modest there, so we're not really expecting meaningful growth away from Card.\n",
      "But of course, we're there for the right deals, right products, right terms. We lend through the cycle, so I see that as more of a demand-driven narrative which will be a function of the economy rather than any tightening on our side.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 1, Justification: The CFO provides a very direct and specific answer to the analyst's multi-part question. He addresses both the Investment Banking pipeline and the loan growth outlook in detail, outlining expectations, headwinds, and drivers for each component. The response is comprehensive and leaves little room for ambiguity, fully addressing the substance of the implied 'trade-off' by explaining the outlook for each side.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Betsy L. Graseck (Analyst): I just wanted to unpack a little bit more the drivers of the change you outlined that's coming in the 10-Q, Jeremy, regarding the asset sensitivity going from liability-sensitive to asset-sensitive, at least that's the way I read it. I just wanted to understand what the drivers of that is.\n",
      "Jeremy Barnum (CFO): Yeah, sure. No problem, Betsy. I mean, as you know, that's always been a challenging number. It's meant as a risk management measure of sorts, although it's also somewhat limited in that respect, and it has been of uneven usefulness in terms of a tool to be able to predict our Net Interest Income trajectory when rates change.\n",
      "But as we've looked at that and try to improve it and spoken to all of you through this latest rate hiking cycle, we've come to the conclusion that it would improve the usefulness of the disclosure if we included in the modeling the effect of deposit repricing lags.\n",
      "And so, we've done that and that just has the effect that I talked about – it increases the EaR number about $4 billion from minus $1.5 billion, which is roughly what it was last quarter and what it would've been this quarter without the change to something more like $2.5 billion.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 1, Justification: The CFO directly answers the question about the drivers of the change in asset sensitivity, clearly stating that the inclusion of deposit repricing lags in the modeling is the reason. He explains the rationale behind this change and its quantitative impact, directly addressing the analyst's query.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Steven Chubak (Analyst): Can you size the reward liability impact?\n",
      "Jeremy Barnum (CFO): Why don't you get Mikael to give that to you? It's not that significant but it's enough to just make the sequential number look a little bit wonky.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 5, Justification: The CFO completely avoids providing the requested quantitative \"size\" of the reward liability impact. Instead, they deflect the question by telling the analyst to obtain the information from another person and provide only vague, qualitative descriptions, failing to directly address the core of the question.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Mike Mayo (Analyst): And then one quick follow-up to that. Your efficiency ratio this quarter is the lowest we've seen in a long, long time and I guess you're saying don't extrapolate this efficiency ratio because Net Interest Income will come down at some point. But when you just simply look at – you benchmark yourself against the low-cost providers, where do you think you're there now and where can you still go because if you extrapolate this quarter, you're getting closer?\n",
      "Jeremy Barnum (CFO): Yeah. I mean, you said it yourself, right? You definitely can't extrapolate the current numbers.\n",
      "But I think more broadly on benchmarking ourselves to low-cost providers, it sort of speaks to an area that you've been interested in for a long time which is all of the investment that we're doing in technology to improve generally scalability and get more of our cost base to be variable versus fixed in terms of how we respond to volumes – that's a big part of the reason that we're doing the investments that we're doing, and modernization and cloud and Artificial Intelligence and all the type of stuff that we've talked about a lot.\n",
      "So I think we feel really good about our efficiency as a company, but there definitely is room for improvement.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 4, Justification: The CFO acknowledges the question about benchmarking against low-cost providers but avoids providing any specific current position or future targets relative to these providers. Instead, the response pivots to general statements about technology investments and overall efficiency improvements, without directly addressing the comparative aspect of the question.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Ebrahim H. Poonawala (Analyst): Okay. Thank you.\n",
      "Mike Mayo (Analyst): Hi. I had another question on Vice Chair Barr's speech from this week. To the extent that capital ratios do go up 20% for you and perhaps others, to what degree would you think about changing your business model in terms of remixing where you do business, repricing or simply removing activities that you used to do?\n",
      "It's kind of ironic, or maybe it's not ironic, that Apollo hits an all-time stock price high at the same week of the speech. So how much business leaves JPMorgan or the industry if capital ratios do go up as much as potentially proposed?\n",
      "Jeremy Barnum (CFO): Yeah. Mike, I mean...\n",
      "Jamie Dimon (CEO): Wait. Before Jeremy answers the question, this is great news for hedge funds, private equity, private credit, Apollo, Blackstone – and they’re dancing in the streets.\n",
      "Jeremy Barnum (CFO): Yeah, exactly. And I was going to say, Mike, yes to everything, so meaning repricing, yes, definitely.\n",
      "To the extent that we have pricing power and the higher capital requirements mean that we're not generating the right returns for shareholders, we will try to reprice and we'll see how that sticks and how that flows into the economy and how that affects demand for products.\n",
      "And if the repricing is not successful, then in some cases we will have to remix and that means getting out of certain products and services.\n",
      "And as Jamie points out, that probably means that those products and services leave the regulated perimeter and go elsewhere, and that's fine. As Jamie points out, those people are clients and I think that point was addressed also in Vice Chair Barr's speech.\n",
      "But traditionally, having risky activities leave the regulated perimeter has had some negative consequences, so these are all important things to consider.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 1, Justification: The management's response directly addresses the analyst's question by confirming they would consider repricing, remixing, and removing activities. They explicitly state that business would likely leave the regulated perimeter, directly answering the question about business leaving JPMorgan and the industry. The answer is clear and specific about their strategic considerations without evasion.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Gerard Cassidy (Analyst): Very good. And then as a follow-up, you mentioned in giving us the read-through on the Commercial Banking segment of the business that you had some reserve building tied to some office real estate and also some downgrades in the Middle Market area. Can you go a little deeper? What are you guys seeing in this area, both Commercial Real Estate but also the C&I loans? What's happening in that segment as well?\n",
      "Jeremy Barnum (CFO): Yeah. So I would caution you from drawing too broad a conclusion from this. I mean, I think that when we talk about office for example, our portfolio as you know is quite small and our exposure to sort of so-called urban dense office is even smaller.\n",
      "The vast majority of our overall portfolio is multi-family lending so as a result, like our sample size of observed valuations on office properties is quite small.\n",
      "But you know we like to be sort of ahead of the cycle, and based on everything that we saw this quarter it just felt reasonable to build a little bit there to get to what felt like a comfortable coverage ratio.\n",
      "In the Middle Market segment, we saw downgrades in excess of upgrades, but I don't see that as sort of necessarily indicative of anything terribly significant in the broader read-across.\n",
      "Gerard Cassidy (Analyst): Thank you.\n",
      "Jeremy Barnum (CFO): Steve, you there?\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 4, Justification: The CFO provides some observations but consistently downplays their significance and avoids delving deeper into specific market trends or underlying reasons, as requested. The response focuses more on the company's specific portfolio characteristics and why the issues are not broadly significant to their business rather than providing detailed insights into market conditions.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Mike Mayo (Analyst): And then last quick follow-up...\n",
      "Jamie Dimon (CEO): Mike, I think we're kind of running as fast as we can. So if you actually sat down directly with credit compliance, auto market, bankers, recruiters, traders – Mike, this is it. We're full effort right now and we want to make sure we get things right and get things thoughtful and careful. So it's not just the money, it's the people and how many things you can change all at once and add to all at once.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 5, Justification: Jamie Dimon's response pre-emptively shuts down the analyst's follow-up question before it can even be fully articulated. He explicitly states \"this is it\" and claims the team is at \"full effort\" and cannot handle more changes, thereby preventing any further inquiry. This is a very evasive tactic as it avoids the question by preventing it from being asked.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Steven Chubak (Analyst): Helpful color, and just a follow-up on Card income. Revenues were muted in the quarter. I was hoping you could unpack just the sources of pressure. Maybe more specifically, how much of a drag is associated with FAS 91 versus some other factors.\n",
      "Jeremy Barnum (CFO): Yeah. So actually, that Card income number, Steve, is a little bit of a one-off thing. So we had a reward liability adjustment this quarter, kind of a technical thing, so that's just a temporary headwind.\n",
      "And also, the sequential comparison is also getting hurt by a small positive one-off item in the prior period. And obviously, I know you guys looked at it, but Card income isn't sort of a thing we look at that much ourselves.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 4, Justification: The CFO provides some general reasons for the muted Card income, such as a reward liability adjustment and a prior period one-off item. However, the answer completely avoids addressing the specific question regarding the impact of FAS 91. The concluding remark about not closely tracking Card income also serves as a deflection rather than a direct response.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Mike Mayo (Analyst): Wait, wait. Just to be clear. It's just the flip side of the question I asked for two years, going back to it.\n",
      "Jeremy Barnum (CFO): Fair enough. I appreciate the balance. In all seriousness, we've always been pretty clear, right, that our spending is through-the-cycle spending based on through-the-cycle investment, through-the-cycle spending based on our through-the-cycle view of the earnings-generating power of the company and the goal to produce the right returns.\n",
      "So broadly speaking, Net Interest Income tends to flow straight through to the bottom line, both when it's going up and, by the way, when it's going down too, and we've been through those moments as you well remember.\n",
      "So whether or not there are opportunities to deploy some more dollars into marketing and stuff like that, we have actually looked at that recently. I don't see that being a meaningful item this year, which is part of why we have not revised the expense guidance so far.\n",
      "But this is about investing through the cycle and being honest and disciplined about which revenue items carry expense loading and which of them don't.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 2, Justification: The CFO initially provides a broad, philosophical response about \"through-the-cycle spending,\" which is somewhat generic. However, they then directly address the implied question about increased spending or revised guidance, stating they don't see meaningful new marketing spend this year and have not revised expense guidance. This provides a clear, specific answer to the core of the analyst's query, making it mostly direct despite the initial context.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Matt O'Connor (Analyst): Yeah. I mean, again, I 100% agree, but we've never seen kind of loans-to-deposit ratios for banks like yours this low, so you could just let deposits run off at a modest amount for quite some time and make the decision not to pay up. I mean, I've seen the trade-off that eventually you'll...\n",
      "Jamie Dimon (CEO): But that's a little more complicated because a lot of that loan-to-value ratio is lower because of regulatory stuff, Liquidity Coverage Ratio Market., capital ratio, etcetera.\n",
      "Matt O'Connor (Analyst): Got it. Okay. All right. Thank you.\n",
      "Jeremy Barnum (CFO): Thanks.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 4, Justification: The CEO avoids directly addressing the analyst's point about the bank's flexibility to manage deposits given a low loan-to-deposit ratio. Instead of discussing the strategic implications or plans for deposits, the response diverts the topic to the regulatory reasons behind the low ratio, which was not the core of the analyst's strategic inquiry.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Ebrahim H. Poonawala (Analyst): Good morning. I guess just first question, following up on the outlook for the economy. Like, we've all been worried about the recession for a year and there's a debate about the lagged effects of the Fed rate hike cycle. When you think about – Jeremy, I think you mentioned your unemployment outlook relatively similar today versus a quarter ago – how worried should we be in terms of the credit cycle 6 to 12 months from now? Or are you leaning towards concluding that maybe U.S. businesses, consumers have absorbed the rate cycle a lot better than we expected a year ago?\n",
      "Jeremy Barnum (CFO): Yeah. So, I mean, I'm sure Jamie has some views here. But in my view, I would just caution against jumping to too many super-positive conclusions based on a couple of recent prints. And I think generally, our point is less about trying to predict a particular outcome and more about trying to make sure that we don't get too much euphoria that over-concentrates people on one particular prediction when we know that there's a range of outcomes out there.\n",
      "So obviously, people are talking a lot about the potential for soft-landing right now, no landing, immaculate disinflation or whatever. And whether our own views on that have changed meaningfully, I don't know.\n",
      "But the broader point is that we continue to be quite focused on Jamie's prior comment that loss rates still have room to normalize even post-pandemic, so we're probably over-earning on credit a little bit.\n",
      "Obviously, we've talked about the expectation that the Net Interest Income is going to come down quite a bit. So even forgetting about whether you get some surprisingly negative outcomes on the economy from where we stand today, even in a central case you just need to recognize that there should be some significant normalization.\n",
      "Jamie Dimon (CEO): Yeah. And I would just add that the 5.8% is not our prediction. That is the average of the unemployment under multiple scenarios that we have to use which are hypothetical for Current Expected Credit Losses. So you have this prediction that's going to always look something different and we don't know the outcome.\n",
      "We try to be really clear here – the consumer is in good shape, they're spending down their excess cash – that's all tailwinds.\n",
      "Even if we go to a recession, they're going with rather good conditions, low borrowings and good house price values still.\n",
      "But the headwinds are substantial and somewhat unprecedented. There's war in Ukraine, oil and gas, quantitative tightening, unprecedented fiscal needs of governments, QT which we never experienced before. I just think people should take a deep breath on that.\n",
      "We don't know if those things could put us in a soft landing, a mild recession or a hard recession. And obviously, we all hope for the best.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 4, Justification: The executives largely avoid directly answering the question about the credit cycle 6 to 12 months out or whether they are leaning towards a conclusion that businesses/consumers have absorbed rate hikes well. Instead, they emphasize the bank's non-predictive stance, highlight a range of economic outcomes, and stress general uncertainties and the expectation of credit normalization, rather than providing a clear outlook or level of worry.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Betsy L. Graseck (Analyst): Right. But you were saying earlier deposit betas you do anticipate are going to be accelerating from here, and that's part of the outlook for Net Interest Income longer-term to normalize in the mid-70s. Is that right?\n",
      "Jeremy Barnum (CFO): Yes, but let me emphasize something on that. Go ahead, Jamie.\n",
      "Jamie Dimon (CEO): Yeah. I mean, basically, yes. If you have – if the next round is going to be the beta will be 30 to 40 to 50 Basis Points, I mean, whatever the product is, yeah, that's the lag. And the $2.5 billion will go down over time as that actually happens – if rates actually go up. If rates don't actually go up, that $2.5 billion may be exactly $2.5 billion again.\n",
      "Jeremy Barnum (CFO): Yeah.\n",
      "Betsy L. Graseck (Analyst): Got it.\n",
      "Jeremy Barnum (CFO): Yeah, exactly. And what I was going to say, Betsy, is just that the projection of the $87 billion coming down to a significantly lower number contains both the element of internal migration as well as the potential, which is by no means guaranteed, of product-level reprice. And furthermore then, obviously the dynamics are a little bit different in the different business segments as you move from large corporate Wholesale to Consumer.\n",
      "Betsy L. Graseck (Analyst): Okay. All right. Thank you. Appreciate it.\n",
      "Jeremy Barnum (CFO): Yeah.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 1, Justification: The management directly answers the analyst's question, starting with \"basically, yes.\" They then elaborate on the conditions under which deposit betas would accelerate and how that impacts the Net Interest Income outlook, providing specific figures and additional context without avoiding the core premise.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Mike Mayo (Analyst): Alright. Thank you.\n",
      "Steven Chubak (Analyst): Hey. Thanks for taking the question and apologies for the technical issues earlier. Wanted to ask on the deposit outlook – just with signs that recent liquidity drawdown has come predominantly out of RRP versus industry deposits, just wanted to get your thoughts on what expectations you have for deposit growth in the second half, both for you and even the broader industry, especially as Treasury issuance really begins to ramp in earnest.\n",
      "Jeremy Barnum (CFO): Yeah. Good question, Steve, so let me say a couple things about this. So obviously, our deposit numbers have bounced around a little bit as a function of some of the turmoil that we saw in regional banks as well as obviously the First Republic transaction.\n",
      "But now, if you look at our kind of end-of-period deposits this quarter and you project forward, our core view is that we would expect a sort of modest downward trend to re-assert itself from this higher starting point, broadly as a function of QT playing through the system but noting that we do have some hope for offsets by taking share.\n",
      "Just to give a couple examples, like in Consumer, we've got some of our branch expansion markets seasoning and so there are share opportunities there.\n",
      "And in Wholesale, we’ve obviously invested a lot in products and services and so we think we have compelling offerings that are helping us win mandates, and so there are potentially some share offsets there. But broadly, our core view remains modest deposit declines across the franchise.\n",
      "Within that, you note the same thing we've noted that as we got through the debt ceiling and the TGA build has come into effect, and you've seen a lot of bill issuance, big question in the market about whether that was going to come out of reserves or come out of RRP. And so far, with most of the TGA build – I guess they're targeting $600 billion and they're at $550 billion – or something so they're almost done, more of it than some people feared has come out of RRP.\n",
      "So as you say, I think that's a relatively good sign and highlights how the system works better when you've got ample supply of short-dated collateral on the front end of the yield curve. So that whole RRP/TGA bank reserve dynamic is going to continue to be significant, but it is good to see RRP coming down a little bit.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 2, Justification: The CFO provided a clear and specific outlook for the bank's own deposit trends for the second half, including drivers and offsets. While they thoroughly discussed the broader industry's liquidity dynamics concerning Treasury issuance and RRP, they stopped short of providing a specific forward-looking expectation for deposit growth across the entire industry, instead focusing on current observations of liquidity flows.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Ebrahim H. Poonawala (Analyst): Got it. And just a follow-up on the upcoming Basel reforms, two questions. You've talked about the impact to the U.S. economy, like others have said the same. At this point, is that falling on deaf ears? And secondly, maybe, Jeremy, if you can touch upon just structural changes that you expect to make in the Capital Markets business because of FRTB. Thank you.\n",
      "Jeremy Barnum (CFO): Yeah. So on your first point, I mean, I think you can just read Vice Chair Barr's speech, right?\n",
      "Ebrahim H. Poonawala (Analyst): Yeah.\n",
      "Jeremy Barnum (CFO): He addressed that point fairly directly. He clearly doesn't agree as is his right, so we'll see what happens.\n",
      "We continue to feel that, all else equal, higher capital requirements definitely are going to increase the cost of credit, which is bad for the economy, so we'll see what happens on that.\n",
      "On FRTB, it's really very nuanced. It's probably too much detail for this call, to be honest. But just to give you like one immaterial and insignificant but useful example, one product under FRTB is yield curve spread options.\n",
      "And if the FRTB proposal goes through as currently written, that product just becomes not viable. So, obviously, if we need to stop doing that product, no one really cares. But it's just one example of the way sometimes, when you're really disciplined about allocating capital thoroughly all the way down to individual products and responding accordingly, you can wind up having to change your business mix.\n",
      "There are obviously more significant products that matter much more for the real economy like mortgage where the layering-on of the operational risk and the way it's being proposed, especially if some of the other beneficial elements of the proposal don't come through, you're once again making that product even harder to offer to homeowners. So we'll see, we'll see what happens.\n",
      "Jamie Dimon (CEO): I would just add to that. Even if your product doesn't make money, you might do it for clients who are great clients. You're going to manage by product, by client, and by effectively business mix, and those need adjustments.\n",
      "Roughly, loans don't make sense to put on your balance sheet as a whole, almost any loan, and people have to recognize that. And so we just manage through all the various complications here and figure out what the hell to do.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 4, Justification: The response largely avoids detailing specific structural changes expected in the Capital Markets business due to FRTB, stating it's \"too much detail for this call.\" Instead of outlining structural shifts, the executives provide general examples of product viability issues and a high-level \"manage through\" approach, which deflects from the core of the question.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Charles W. Peabody (Analyst): All right. So sort of wrapped into that as a follow-up, if you take your $87 billion forecast for Net Interest Income this year, and that implies at least one quarter of maybe $22 billion of Net Interest Income, and you take your eventual forecast of mid-$70 billion of Net Interest Income at some point in the future, that would imply at least one quarter of $18 billion of Net Interest Income so that's about an 18% drop. And if you hold the balance sheet steady, you're talking about a 30-basis point drop in your margin, your Net Interest Margin, to get from $22 billion to $18 billion. I mean, what is driving – is it really the deposit or are you thinking in terms of interest reversals as credit deteriorates or is it rebuilding of liquidity? I'm just trying to get a better sense of the impact is.\n",
      "Jeremy Barnum (CFO): Yeah. Hey, Charlie. I would think about that as being really entirely a deposit story. It's just not that complicated, right? I think we did this – I think it was either in the fourth quarter or in the first quarter – where we put a little chart on a page, just very simple terms, that shows what the dollar consequences are of whatever – like 10-basis point change in deposit rate paid in terms of Net Interest Income run rate.\n",
      "So whether it's as a consequence of migration from lower-yielding to higher-yielding, going from 0% to a 4% CD is obviously a big impact on margin. Or whether it's because savings reprices, relatively small changes in rate there are kind of a lot of money when you've got a couple trillion dollars of deposits. So it's really not any more complicated than that and that's why we're being so forceful about reminding people about what we expect that trajectory to be.\n",
      "Charles W. Peabody (Analyst): Thank you.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 1, Justification: The CFO directly and clearly attributes the anticipated Net Interest Income decline to \"entirely a deposit story,\" providing specific mechanisms like migration to higher-yielding products and repricing of savings deposits. He explicitly dismisses other potential factors raised by the analyst, fully addressing the core question about the drivers of the NII impact.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Betsy L. Graseck (Analyst): So then…\n",
      "Jeremy Barnum (CFO): All the usual caveats apply, right? I mean, it's never – the answer is going to always – for any given change in rates, the change in our Net Interest Income is always going to be for one reason or another different from what that disclosure shows. But we do our best to make it easy.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 5, Justification: The CFO's response is highly evasive as it provides only a generic disclaimer about the complexity and variability of Net Interest Income (NII) in relation to rate changes. Phrases like \"All the usual caveats apply\" and \"for one reason or another different from what that disclosure shows\" preemptively explain away discrepancies without offering any specific insight. This general statement effectively provides no relevant or actionable information to the analyst.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "John McDonald (Analyst): And just as a follow up, it seems like you’ve done some securities repositioning the last couple quarters. How are you positioning the balance sheet in terms of cash and the securities portfolio, given your outlook for rates?\n",
      "Jeremy Barnum (CFO): Yeah. I think I would say that while we're not predicting higher rates, I don't know if Jamie will have something to say here, we believe in being prepared for it and that's been our position for some time and, of course, that's produced good results.\n",
      "And we continue to try to position ourselves so that neither have significantly higher rates nor significant lower rates present a particularly large challenge to the company.\n",
      "So probably at the margin, we're still a little bit biased for slightly higher rates.\n",
      "But, do keep in mind that when modeling the duration of the balance sheet, higher rates do extend the duration or rather shorten the duration on the deposit side, so that can be a factor as well.\n",
      "John McDonald (Analyst): Okay, thanks.\n",
      "Steven Chubak (Analyst): Hey, good morning.\n",
      "Jeremy Barnum (CFO): Hey, Steve.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 4, Justification: The CFO's response avoids directly detailing how the balance sheet is being positioned in terms of cash and the securities portfolio. Instead, it offers general statements about being prepared for various rate environments and a slight bias towards higher rates, without providing specific actions or allocations for these assets, thus skirting the core of the analyst's question.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Betsy L. Graseck (Analyst): Okay. And so, is it fair for me to think about that change as a mark-to-market to where we are today? And when I think about your forward guide here, longer-term you're saying, look, deposit betas are accelerating. So as I go through the 10-Qs over the next four, five quarters, I should expect that that $2.5 billion should come down because deposit betas you're anticipating are going to be accelerating from here? I'm just trying to put those two things together.\n",
      "Jeremy Barnum (CFO): Yeah, it's a good question. It's quite a technical issue. So I think in the past, the way this number was constructed was to assume through-the-cycle betas on all the deposits, and so your notion that like the number would include deposit beta acceleration would not have been the case because it would've been using essentially terminal deposit betas based on the forward curve and then based on a 100% shock to the forward curve.\n",
      "The nuance that we've introduced now is to recognize that given the shock, the reprice that the beta predicts will not be instantaneous, and so you get sort of just the mathematical consequences of that.\n",
      "But I think translating that into a statement about our expectation for beta for the next 12 months relative to our Net Interest Income guide might be a bridge too far. I'm not sure you can actually draw that conclusion.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 4, Justification: The CFO provides a technical explanation of past and current methodologies, offering some context on how the numbers are derived. However, he explicitly states that translating this information into the analyst's specific expectation about the '$2.5 billion' figure decreasing due to accelerating betas 'might be a bridge too far,' thereby avoiding a direct confirmation or denial of the core financial projection and redirecting from the forward-looking inquiry.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Steven Chubak (Analyst): Hi. Jeremy, I was hoping to just inquire about the capital markets outlook. You cited improved activity levels in September. But given persistently higher rates, geopolitical tensions, and just poor performance of recent IPOs, how are you thinking about the outlook over the near to medium term? And how are you thinking about just the timing of an inflection activity?\n",
      "Jeremy Barnum (CFO): Yeah. Good question. I mean, as you know obviously, the current levels in investment banking remain quite depressed; certainly relative to the elevated levels we saw during the pandemic, but even relative to sort of 2019, which is what you might consider the last normal year.\n",
      "We do eventually think we'll recover to those levels and hopefully recover to above those levels, recognizing by the time it happens you will have had many years of economic growth in the meantime.\n",
      "And to be fair, while the current environment is a little bit complicated and mixed and there are some headwinds as you pointed out, things have improved a little bit. And I think I would say our banking team is a little bit more optimistic than they were last quarter.\n",
      "So it feels to me like a little bit of a slow grind with some positive momentum but obviously significant uncertainty in the outlook and some structural headwinds given lower levels of announced Mergers & Acquisitions and some regulatory headwinds on that side.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 4, Justification: The CFO provides a general overview of the current market sentiment and long-term recovery expectations, but conspicuously avoids addressing the analyst's specific question regarding the \"timing of an inflection activity.\" While acknowledging some positive momentum, the response remains vague about the \"near to medium term\" outlook, using general statements like \"slow grind\" and highlighting \"significant uncertainty\" rather than offering a direct projection.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Steven Chubak (Analyst): Great. Thanks for taking my questions.\n",
      "Glenn Schorr (Analyst): Thank you. Just want to follow-up on this pricing power conversation because you've been consistent over time that you have a limited ability to sustain pricing power due to the competitive landscape. But I guess my question is if not now, when? Meaning, a lot has changed on the institutional side, the European bank side, the regional bank side and I would think that there’d be certain businesses that you have a greater ability and willingness to push price on.\n",
      "And then maybe you could tie that to your comments in the press release on what are the material – what are the real-world consequences for markets and end users that you're referring to when talking about material regulatory changes? Thanks a lot.\n",
      "Jeremy Barnum (CFO): Sure. So, look, on pricing power, you're right – it really depends on the product and it depends on the competitive landscape across different banks, and so it's very granular, it's very product-specific and in some cases we'll have more pricing power than in other cases.\n",
      "I think the overall point that we're trying to make in connection with Basel III Endgame is just that like we think the capital increases are excessive and it puts pressure on returns all else equal, that obviously puts pressure on us to increase price where we can.\n",
      "That is generally a bad thing for the real economy and how all that plays out in detail across different products and services remains to be seen, importantly since we don't actually have the proposal yet – so we need those details. And sorry, Glenn I forgot the second half of your question. What was it?\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 5, Justification: The CFO's response is highly evasive. The question about when and in which businesses they might exert pricing power is met with generic statements about granularity and a deferral to future regulatory details, offering no concrete examples or timelines. Additionally, the CFO explicitly states he forgot the second part of the analyst's question, leading to a complete lack of response for that inquiry.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Ebrahim H. Poonawala (Analyst): Hey. Good morning. Just first question, Jeremy, on credit. I think you mentioned some of the reserves release was tied to the change in the central scenario. So just talk to us and remind us what the central scenario is today, what changed? And then in terms of fundamentally on credit, like where are you seeing softness either on the Consumer or the Commercial side?\n",
      "Jeremy Barnum (CFO): Yeah. So on the central scenario, you should read the research that gets put out by our competitors and our excellent research team.\n",
      "No, but in all seriousness, I think our U.S. economists had their central case outlook to include a very mild recession with I think two quarters of negative half a percent of Gross Domestic Product growth in the fourth quarter and first quarter of this year, and that then got revised out early this quarter to now have sort of modest growth I think around 1% for a few quarters into 2024.\n",
      "So, just flowing that through our process while acknowledging that we're still skewed to the downside, we're still reserved to a significantly higher unemployment rate on a weighted-average basis than is in the central case outlook.\n",
      "So that number we've sometimes given you is 5.5% this quarter. So, it's really not much more complicated than that. We're just kind of following the process.\n",
      "And I think your other question was where am I seeing softness in credit? And I think the answer to that is actually nowhere, roughly.\n",
      "We're certainly nowhere that's not expected, meaning, we continue to see the normalization story play out in Consumer more or less exactly as expected, and then of course, we are seeing a trickle of charge-offs coming through the office space.\n",
      "You see that in the charge-off number of the Commercial Bank, but the numbers are very small and more or less just the realization of the allowance that we've already built there.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 1, Justification: The CFO's response directly addressed both parts of the analyst's question. He provided specific details regarding the change in the central economic scenario and clearly stated where the bank is (and is not) seeing credit softness, offering specific examples like the expected normalization in consumer credit and the small, anticipated charge-offs in office space.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Matt O'Connor (Analyst): Good morning. So I'm in your camp that eventually consumers will want more deposit rate sensitivity here. But I guess what would make you change your rates meaningfully? So the top two banks have about 50% consumer market share, loan-to-deposit ratios are low. Your outlook for loan growth, and I think others, is fairly sluggish, at least outside of Card. I get that it's common sense, and that's what we've seen historically. But there really is this kind of big divergence among big banks and everybody else where the big banks just don't need to pay that much for deposits for a slew of reasons. So what would make you change that?\n",
      "Jeremy Barnum (CFO): Yeah. In the end, Matt, it's just feedback from the field. It's competition and feedback from the field. We – Jamie, go ahead.\n",
      "Jamie Dimon (CEO): I think every bank is in a different position about what they need, and so you have a whole range of outcomes. But remember, we do this also by city, so you have different competition in Arizona – in Phoenix – than you have in Chicago, Illinois. And when you do have high interest rate products, so it's a combination of all those things.\n",
      "I wouldn't call it big bank versus small bank, and you're going to see when everyone reports who kind of paid up a little more for things and who didn't and things like that.\n",
      "So, look, guys, I would take it as a given. I think it's a mistake. There is very little pricing power in most of our business and betas are going to go up. Take it as a given. There is no circumstance that we've ever seen in the history of banking where rates didn't get to a certain point that you had to have competing products. And rates go up through migration or direct rates or movement to CDs or money market funds. We're going to have to compete for that – you already see it in parts of our business, and not in other parts.\n",
      "Matt O'Connor (Analyst): Yeah. I 100%...\n",
      "Jeremy Barnum (CFO): Yeah. Matt, it's really just about primary bank relationships in the end. That's the core of the strategy.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 4, Justification: The analyst asked what specific factors would make the bank meaningfully change its deposit rates. The answer provides general reasons like \"competition and feedback from the field\" and asserts that rates will inevitably go up due to market dynamics and historical patterns. However, it avoids outlining any specific internal or external triggers, thresholds, or metrics that would prompt their bank to make such a meaningful change, instead relying on broad statements about market forces.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Glenn Schorr (Analyst): Actually, I think you hit on it so I'll just do a follow-up on a related. So the notion of private credit doing large traditional investment-grade lending activity is maybe part of the competitive landscape that limits the ability to push price. In Jamie's letter, you talked about the downside – or my question is what's the downside if more of the mortgage credit asset-backed intermediation business is pushed out of the banking system?\n",
      "Jeremy Barnum (CFO): I mean, I guess it depends on what you mean by downside. But I just think societally speaking, I think we've seen in recent history that when home lending is happening outside the regulated perimeter and things get bad, when you have economic downturns, it produces bad outcomes for individuals and homeowners and society as a whole, and Jamie has written about this extensively.\n",
      "Beyond that, financially, we've talked about how mortgage lending – I mean, the profitability swings obviously is reasonably cyclical and the recent past has actually been very profitable, then it was less so. Like, the correspondent channel right now is actually picking up a little bit.\n",
      "But it's a thin-margin business, it's challenging. And when you increase the capital requirements, it makes it even harder so that just becomes one of the areas where you're in that tension between remixing versus pricing power that we talked about a second ago.\n",
      "And it might, in fact, mean that we do less – less credit available for homeowners and more regulatory risk as the activity moves outside the perimeter.\n",
      "Glenn Schorr (Analyst): Appreciate that, Jeremy.\n",
      "Betsy L. Graseck (Analyst): Hi. Good morning.\n",
      "Jeremy Barnum (CFO): Hi, Betsy.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 4, Justification: The CFO's answer largely avoids addressing the direct financial downside for the bank if mortgage intermediation business is pushed out of the banking system. Instead, he focuses on the societal risks of lending moving outside the regulated perimeter and highlights the challenging, thin-margin nature of the mortgage business for banks, almost implying its departure is not a significant financial loss. This represents a redirection from the specific question about the bank's downside.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Jim Mitchell (Analyst): Okay. Great. Thanks.\n",
      "Erika Najarian (Analyst): Hi. Good morning. Jeremy, I'm just laughing to myself because I said to you at Investor Day – do you have any more Net Interest Income rabbits to pull out of the hat, and I guess you do.\n",
      "So I guess, I want to ask a broader question really here. And maybe, Jamie, I'd like to get your thoughts. So you earned 23% ROTCE on 13.8% Common Equity Tier 1, and we hear you loud and clear that you're more normalized Net Interest Income generation is not $87 billion.\n",
      "That being said, and fully taking into account the potential haircut from Basel III Endgame, is it possible that your natural ROTCE is maybe above that 17% through-the-cycle rate when rates aren't zero?\n",
      "Because when you first introduced that ROTCE target, we were in a different world from a rate scenario and everybody's talking about even if the Fed cuts, the natural sort of bottom in Fed funds is not going to be zero. So any input on that would be great.\n",
      "Jeremy Barnum (CFO): Yeah. Thanks, Erika. I mean, it's a good question. There's a lot in there, obviously. I guess I would start by saying that when we talked about the 17% through-the-cycle ROTCE, even though we may have introduced that in a moment when we were at the lower zero bound, it was always premised on a sort of normalized rate environment, and at some level that remains true today.\n",
      "Furthermore, you didn't ask this explicitly, but in the context of the proposed Basel III Endgame, one relevant question might be if you have a lot more capital in the denominator, what happens to that target?\n",
      "So I think as I said in my prepared remarks, we feel very confident about the company's ability to produce excellent returns through the cycle. There's a lot of moving parts right now in that; some of them could be good, some of them could be bad.\n",
      "Narrowly, on the capital one, the one thing to point out is that the straight-up math of simply diluting down the ROTCE by expanding the denominator misses the possibility of reprice, repricing of products and services, which of course goes back to our point that these capital increases do have impacts on the real economy.\n",
      "So we're not suggesting that we can price our way out of it, but we obviously need to get the right returns on products and services, and where we have pricing power we will adjust to the higher capital.\n",
      "So a lot of moving parts in there, but I think the important point is that through a range of scenarios we feel good about our ability to deliver good results. And we'll see how the mix of all the various factors plays out especially after we see the Basel III proposal and then go through the comment period.\n",
      "Jamie Dimon (CEO): And Erika, I would just add one thing. We do have a mix of businesses that earn from like 0% ROTCE to 100%. We have some which are very capital-intensive so we look at kind of all of them, and I think 17% is a good number and a good target.\n",
      "The other thing we're over-earning on is credit. We've been over-earning on credit for a substantial amount of time now, we're quite conscious about it.\n",
      "We know that it's going to pick up just as it normalizes, considerably more than now. Look, we would consider credit card normalizing to be closer to 3.5%.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 4, Justification: The executives largely avoid directly answering whether their natural ROTCE could be above 17% in the current rate environment. Instead, they reiterate the existing 17% target as 'good,' introduce the uncertainty of Basel III Endgame, and discuss other factors like credit normalization, thus deflecting from a clear commitment or explanation regarding a potentially higher ROTCE. The responses are filled with general statements and deferrals rather than a specific answer to the 'possibility' of exceeding the target.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Ryan Kenny (Analyst): Thank you.\n",
      "Gerard Cassidy (Analyst): Good morning, Jeremy. How are you?\n",
      "Jeremy Barnum (CFO): Hey, Gerard.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 1, Justification: The analyst's comment was a social greeting ('How are you?') and not a substantive business question. The CFO's response was a direct and appropriate social acknowledgment, fully addressing the informal nature of the analyst's opening.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Ebrahim H. Poonawala (Analyst): That's helpful. And just going back to the details you laid out on Basel Endgame, maybe on the philosophical side I think Jamie was speaking last month, said that we don't expect any changes but at the same time, you make everything that makes sense in terms of the pushback. Is it all falling on deaf ears from a shareholder perspective? Are we resigned to the fact that we are going to see more towards the worst-case outcome play out or is there some level of sort of meeting in the middle of the road as this thing gets finalized?\n",
      "Jeremy Barnum (CFO): Yeah. So I'll let Jamie speak for himself on that point, but our job is to advocate. We're not going to guess what the sentiment is in Washington.\n",
      "It's a thousand-page rule proposal, as you know. We've got the big team of very smart people studying it very closely.\n",
      "Interestingly, we noted recently that in some of the analysis that they did about the impact on lending, they sort of forgot about like – the Fed, in their preamble, they forgot about a $1 billion (sic) [trillion] of operational risk Risk-Weighted Assets. So it just highlights that there is the possibility, or seemed to have forgotten, they simply omitted the impact of the operational risk Risk-Weighted Assets on fees.\n",
      "So anyway, the point is it's long, it’s complicated, it’s technical. We do think there are probably some technical mistakes in there. We're not going to forcefully advocate on all of those.\n",
      "And while we disagree with a lot of this stuff, these are technical issues that should be, in some sense, resolved technically, and hopefully they'll listen.\n",
      "Ebrahim H. Poonawala (Analyst): Got it. Thank you.\n",
      "Jeremy Barnum (CFO): Sorry, I'm just getting a correction in the room. I meant to say trillion.\n",
      "Ebrahim H. Poonawala (Analyst): Yeah, no. I got that. I got the trillion dollars. Yup, thanks.\n",
      "Jamie Dimon (CEO): Is that what we were talking about, actually?\n",
      "Jeremy Barnum (CFO): BPI put something out on it.\n",

      "Ryan Kenny (Analyst): Hey. Good morning.\n",
      "Jamie Dimon (CEO): Hey.\n",
      "Jeremy Barnum (CFO): Hi.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 4, Justification: The CFO largely avoids directly addressing the analyst's core question about the philosophical implications of the Basel Endgame pushback, specifically whether their efforts are 'falling on deaf ears' or if they are 'resigned to a worst-case outcome.' Instead, the response redirects by emphasizing the complexity of the rule, their role in advocating, and highlighting specific technical errors found in the regulatory analysis, rather than the strategic or political outlook.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "John McDonald (Analyst): Hi, good morning. Jeremy, I was wondering if you could give us a little more color in what you're seeing so far on deposit reprice and migration. What's been better than expected so far on that front? And how do you see higher-for-longer rates potentially impacting deposit reprice pressure?\n",
      "Jeremy Barnum (CFO): Sure. Thanks, John. I think the themes are pretty much the same as we've seen in prior quarters.\n",
      "So, as we talked a little bit about on the press call, we've been trying to be a little bit cautious about recognizing that we don't think the current levels are sustainable and we do think that we'll have to reprice in some pockets to some degree, maybe tiering or whatever at some point in the future. And, of course, that hasn't happened yet this year, so that's one factor.\n",
      "In the meantime, the CD strategy is working well. We're getting – continue to get very good feedback from the field and we're capturing money in motion, and so we're seeing the sort of internal migration and the associated slow increase in deposit rate paid as a result of CD migration.\n",
      "But that’s sort of working as we would have hoped and so everything is kind of playing out according to plan, I would say.\n",
      "In terms of higher-for-longer, I think it just means that there will continue to be upward pressure on deposit pricing both from internal migration and possibly moderate effects. And in the end, as we always say, we’re going to price products as a function of the competitive market environment.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 3, Justification: The response partially addresses the questions but lacks specific details and 'color' as requested. While it mentions the CD strategy is 'working well' and aggressive repricing 'hasn't happened yet' (implying things are going as hoped), it doesn't offer explicit examples of what's been 'better than expected.' The impact of higher-for-longer rates is described generically as 'upward pressure' based on the 'competitive market environment,' rather than providing specific insights.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Steven Chubak (Analyst): Thanks for the color. Just for my follow up, on some of the regulatory commentary you provided. Certainly, a lot of helpful color in the slides, so thank you for that. If the proposal were to go through as written, what proportion of the inflation do you believe can be mitigated over time? And was also hoping you could provide some context as to the quantum of how you think Current Expected Credit Losses inclusion could potentially impact the SCB and Comprehensive Capital Analysis.\n",
      "Jeremy Barnum (CFO): Yeah. Those are all good questions, Steve. I think it's probably too early to try to provide that level of quantification on either front.\n",
      "If I start first with the Basel III Endgame proposal, from our perspective, we're currently focused on advocating as aggressively as possible for the necessary changes.\n",
      "Some of which are what you might call philosophical in nature or some of the things I highlighted in my prepared remarks, but some of them are sort of very technical in nature, including things that we think might actually be mistakes in the proposal.\n",
      "And so talking a lot about optimizing away stuff that might change just feels like a bit premature at this point.\n",
      "I would point out that given how significant operational risk Risk-Weighted Assets is as part of the proposal, that is, you can think of that sort of as a generic tax across the entire spectrum and is therefore in some sense non-optimizable.\n",
      "So, we feel that it's important to manage expectations about the level of optimization that's possible, once the rule is finalized and hopefully some of the technical items are addressed.\n",
      "Also, it depends on your definition of optimization. Sometimes I use the term costless optimization, whereas these technical fixes that don’t affect revenue and don’t require you to exit businesses; I think that type of optimization will be harder to find than it has been in the past.\n",
      "But as we pointed out, we may simply need to exit things. And that will be because it is better than the alternative, which would be to do activity that’s shareholder value destructive but it won’t be costless.\n",
      "A good example of that is the renewable energy tax credit investment business, which as a result of the quadrupling of the risk weight, may no longer make sense.\n",
      "Now, that's one that we hope will be changed but it's tricky because those are very long duration assets. So between now and the rule is finalized, it raises some questions about whether we want to put that stuff on the balance sheet.\n",
      "So, sorry a bit of a long answer but then, yeah, on quantifying Current Expected Credit Losses and Comprehensive Capital Analysis, I think we better wait for that one.\n",
      "Cause given the relative lack of transparency that we have into the Fed's exact modeling, in terms of which quarter is the peak and so on and so forth, it's a little bit hard to predict what the exact impact of putting Current Expected Credit Losses and Comprehensive Capital Analysis is going to be.\n",
      "We just know probabilistically that it will, like everything else these days, tend to push capital higher.\n",
      "Steven Chubak (Analyst): Very helpful color, Jeremy. Thanks for taking my question.\n",
      "Jeremy Barnum (CFO): Yeah.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 2, Justification: The CFO directly states that it is 'too early' or 'better to wait' to provide the requested quantification for both parts of the question. However, he offers detailed explanations and relevant qualitative context for why the numbers cannot be provided at this time, addressing the underlying concerns of the question without supplying the specific figures.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Charles W. Peabody (Analyst): Morning. Jeremy, on page 4 of your presentation, you show some liquidity metrics. And there's been a meaningful deterioration, or I shouldn't say deterioration, depletion of some of that excess liquidity, obviously for First Republic primarily. So my question is how quickly do you want to rebuild that liquidity because as I look out towards 2024, there's probably a half dozen variables that are going to make liquidity a premium event – to have excess liquidity? So that's my first question. What's your plans for replenishing that liquidity?\n",
      "Jeremy Barnum (CFO): Yeah. Charlie, so I know we talked about this a little bit at Investor Day, right? So as I said in my prepared remarks, yeah, we think about half of the change in the bank Liquidity Coverage Ratio Market. number is a consequence of First Republic and the rest of it is just the expected decrease in system-wide deposits flowing through into our High Quality Liquid Assets balances and the bank Liquidity Coverage Ratio Market. ratio.\n",
      "So that's all entirely as expected and therefore, I think that the replenishing notion is not correct. In fact, obviously, we still have ample, ample liquidity.\n",
      "Now, if you want to project trends forward, that's a different story but that's sort of the business of banking. We'll adjust accordingly in terms of our asset and liability mix across different products and to ensure compliance to the ratios and fortress balance sheet principles as you would expect from us.\n",
      "Jamie Dimon (CEO): And I would just add to that – just look at the top of the page in the press release, $1.4 trillion of cash and marketable securities. Even if we get down to no excess, we're going to have like, I forgot the exact number, $1.2 trillion. I think we have excess liquidity, and the liquidity ratio is slightly something different. I think there's plenty of liquidity in the system and, of course, we do multiple things to change this overnight if we wanted to.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 2, Justification: The management directly addresses the question by refuting its premise, stating they do not need to rebuild or replenish liquidity due to ample current levels. While they explain their rationale clearly by detailing the composition of liquidity and the impact of First Republic, their forward-looking statements about managing liquidity in 2024 are somewhat generic rather than specific proactive plans.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Ryan Kenny (Analyst): And then on the loan growth side, industry loan growth has slowed significantly this year. What demand are you seeing for loan growth across the different categories? And I know it might be too early to talk about next year, but directionally, how should we think about loan growth given where we are in the cycle and the higher capital requirements coming?\n",
      "Jeremy Barnum (CFO): Yeah, sure. So on loan growth, the story is pretty consistent with what we've been saying all year. So we've, of course, seen very robust loan growth in Card, and that's coming from both spending growth and the normalization in revolving balances. As we look forward, we're still optimistic about that, but it'll probably be a little bit more muted than it has been during this normalization period.\n",
      "In Auto, we've also seen pretty robust loan growth recently, both as a function of sort of slightly more competitive pricing on our side as the industry was a little bit slow to raise rates. And so we lost some share previously, and that's come back now.\n",
      "And generally, the supply chain situation is better, so that's been supported. As we look forward there, it should be a little bit more muted.\n",
      "And I think generally in Wholesale the loan growth story is going to be driven just by the economic environment. So depending on what you believe about soft landing, mild recession, no landing, you have slightly lower or slightly higher loan growth. But in any case, I would expect it to be relatively muted.\n",
      "And, of course, Home Lending remains fairly constrained both by rates and market conditions.\n",
      "But also, and I think this is true across the board, we will be managing things actively, as mentioned in light of Basel III, which may not change originations, but it will change what we retain.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 2, Justification: The CFO directly addresses both aspects of the analyst's question: current loan demand across categories and the directional outlook for future loan growth, considering higher capital requirements. He provides specific details for each loan type regarding current demand and offers a consistent 'muted' outlook for future growth. The impact of Basel III on retention is also explicitly mentioned, directly addressing the capital requirements part of the question.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Ryan Kenny (Analyst): Want to dig in on the Net Interest Income side. So you raised the 2023 Net Interest Income ex. Markets guidance by $2 billion for this year. So I know your comments in the press release suggest JPMorgan's over earning. So I just want to triangulate there. What does normalized Net Interest Income look like? And do we get to normalized next year or later on?\n",
      "Jeremy Barnum (CFO): Yeah, a couple things. So, let me do the timing question first. So we're being very clear that we are not predicting when.\n",
      "When is going to be a function of the marketplace and the rate environment and competitive dynamics and so on and so forth. So we're just really just trying to remind everyone to not bank on the current run rates, which we just don't fundamentally think are sustainable.\n",
      "You'll be aware that before Investor Day earlier this year, we tried to quantify what we thought that kind of normalized range might look like, and we put a sort of mid-70s type number out there.\n",
      "And at Investor Day, we talked about how the acquisition of First Republic was going to push that number up a little bit, although there was some overlap and so on and so forth.\n",
      "So anyway, with the benefit of time and having everything settled in a little bit, if you sort of push us for that, kind of, what is that number now look like, we think it’s probably closer to about $80 billion, with all of the obvious caveats that this is a guess, and we don’t know when. But we’re just trying to point out that it’s quite a bit lower than the current run rate.\n",
      "Ryan Kenny (Analyst): Got it.\n",
      "Jamie Dimon (CEO): Inside the company, some people think it'll happen sooner, i.e. me. Some people think it'll happen later, i.e., Jenn and Marianne and Jeremy.\n",
      "Jeremy Barnum (CFO): I wasn't aware that I was in that camp, actually.\n",
      "Jamie Dimon (CEO): Oh, ok.\n",
      "Jeremy Barnum (CFO): But I don't know, I'm not trying to have an opinion over you.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 1, Justification: The CFO directly answers both parts of the analyst's question. For \"what does normalized Net Interest Income look like,\" a specific figure of $80 billion is provided. For \"when do we get to normalized,\" the CFO explicitly states they are not predicting the timing and explains the market factors that influence it, which is a direct answer to the question of predictability.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Gerard Cassidy (Analyst): Jeremy, you guys have put up a really strong ROTCE number of 22% for the quarter. And when you dive into your different segments, what really jumps out at us is the 40% ex-First Republic ROE in Consumer & Community Banking. I know you and Jamie have talked about your over-earning on credit. We get that. But in view of all of these fintechs and all of these other nonbank competitors that we're all supposed to pick away at everybody's market share, you guys have put up great numbers here. What's the drivers behind an ROE? Even when you take that credit over-earning out, what's driving this business' profitability at such high levels?\n",
      "Jeremy Barnum (CFO): Yeah, Gerard. So I'd say a couple things there. So first, it's not just credit. It's also deposit margin, right?\n",
      "So when we talk about over-earning on Net Interest Income, a disproportionate amount of that is coming out of the Consumer franchise for all of the reasons that we've talked about. But, I would also point out sometimes we don't like the word over-earning because right now, customers are happy and they're doing CDs.\n",
      "And the broader answer to your question about why we're able to be effectively really comes back to a decade, two decade long history of investing for the future and recognizing that there's a holistic value proposition here that includes branches, and the app, and all of the online services, and the entire suite of products and services that is around this enterprise which drives engagement and customer loyalty.\n",
      "And we're seeing some of the benefits of that now, although we're not complacent. The competition is still there. The fintechs are still there, and we know we need to continue investing to preserve the value.\n",
      "And it's also true that the particular circumstances of the current rate and credit environment mean that the earnings are a little bit above normal, but that core franchise is extremely robust.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 3, Justification: The CFO acknowledged the credit and deposit margin factors, which the analyst had already noted. However, instead of providing specific additional drivers for the exceptional current ROE beyond those known impacts, the CFO offered a very general explanation about long-term investment and a holistic value proposition. The response did not pinpoint specific, new operational or financial factors contributing to the high profitability beyond the credit/rate environment.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Gerard Cassidy (Analyst): Very good. And then as a follow up, which ties into your answer on the deposit margin and consumer and your earlier comments you and Jamie about the internal debate inside JPMorgan about the migration of rates going higher on the funding side. Your non-interest-bearing deposits I think are around 28% of total deposits which is slightly above the 26% you guys had back in 2018 or 2019 or pre-pandemic. Is this expectation that you're going to see more of the non-interest-bearing deposits go into interest-bearing? Or, is it just the repricing of interest-bearing deposits that have some of your folks inside JPMorgan a little more cautious on that net interest income number?\n",
      "Jeremy Barnum (CFO): Yeah. It's a good question, Gerard. I think it's a little bit bigger picture than that. And I'm not sure – I get your questions, a good question, but I'm not sure that the reported interest-bearing, non-interest-bearing split is the best lens to look at this through for a couple of reasons.\n",
      "So first, like between Wholesale and Retail, we've got some amount of non-interest-bearing and Wholesale that's part of the ECR product, so you see some dynamics there that play out.\n",
      "And in Consumer, in a world where savings is paying a relatively low-rate paid to cross-checking and savings, the migration dynamics are probably not that different right now.\n",
      "But then of course, even within Consumer across both consumers and small businesses, you've got slightly different dynamics in terms of how people manage their operating balances.\n",
      "So I would tend to zoom out a little bit and see this as a holistic answer, that's driven by internal migration from checking, savings to CDs, from ECR to interest-bearing and Wholesale and then our potential response to the rate environment, the competitive environment, the overall level of system-wide deposits in terms of product level reprice that may or may not happen in moments in the future.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 4, Justification: The CFO avoids directly answering whether the caution on net interest income is primarily due to non-interest-bearing deposit migration or the repricing of interest-bearing deposits. He deflects by stating the question's premise is \"not the best lens\" and broadens the discussion to a \"holistic\" view of various deposit dynamics and market factors, without pinpointing the specific drivers asked.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Jim Mitchell (Analyst): Hey. Good morning. Jeremy, do you think there's any receptivity among regulators regarding the double counting not only of operational risk but I think you alluded to this earlier in the Markets business, but there's clearly double counting in market risk in the trading book. Is there any receptivity?\n",
      "Jamie Dimon (CEO): Can I just answer that real quickly? We don't really know. It's a one-sided conversation generally. They say put it in your comments, so everyone is going to put in extensive comments, kind of like you heard from Jeremy and we don't really know.\n",
      "We don't really know what's going on inside the Fed, how many people get involved. In my view, it's become a very politicized process as opposed to the technical analysis I think is required to do it exactly right. So we'll see.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 2, Justification: The CEO directly answers the question about regulatory receptivity by stating \"We don't really know\" multiple times. He then provides a candid explanation for this lack of insight, detailing the one-sided nature of the conversation and his view on the politicization of the process. While not providing a definitive 'yes' or 'no' on receptivity, he directly addresses the question by explaining why such an answer is currently unavailable to them, rather than deflecting or changing the topic.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "John McDonald (Analyst): Thanks. Jeremy, could you give a little more color on what's baked into the loan loss reserve in terms of kind of weighted average assumptions and how any change in macro outlook played into the dynamics of the reserve builds and releases this quarter?\n",
      "Jeremy Barnum (CFO): Yeah. Actually, John, this quarter, that's all like pretty quiet. So, the weighted average unemployment rate number is still 5.5%. We didn't have any really big revisions in the macro outlook driving the numbers, and our skew remains as it has been – a little bit skewed to the downside. Just recognizing that we still see risks being elevated, which obviously you can see that skew in the difference between the weighted average unemployment of 5.5%, and what's in our central outlook, which I think is something like 4.6% (sic) [4.4%] peak of the current levels.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 1, Justification: The CFO's response is very direct and clear. It directly addresses both parts of the analyst's question by stating the weighted average unemployment rate assumption (5.5%) and explicitly clarifying that there were no significant changes in the macro outlook driving reserve dynamics this quarter.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Matt O'Connor (Analyst): Yeah. Fair enough. And if I could just squeeze in on First Republic, obviously the contribution there is coming in multiples higher-than-expected. How do you think about the puts and takes in terms of, I think there's probably some run-off of loans still to come, but also opportunities to deepen the relationships there?\n",
      "Jeremy Barnum (CFO): Yeah. So you're right about the contribution and about the run-off of loans, and it is notable the First Republic related net income that we've printed this quarter – so the first thing to say is that we don't think that that First Republic related net income number from this quarter is a sustainable indicator of the future run rate.\n",
      "Some of the same dynamics that we've just talked about, in particular, over-earning on deposits or sort of above normal on deposit margins, also apply to the First Republic franchise to some degree. So we would expect that to normalize.\n",
      "And probably more significantly as the things you alluded to, we do have some accelerated pull to par on some of the commitments that we took on at a fair value discount as part of the acquisition, so that's a short-term tailwind in the revenue that will come out of that over the next few quarters.\n",
      "And yeah, in terms of how it's going overall and deepening the relationships, that remains a focus and I think more of that will happen as we continue the integration and we continue stabilizing.\n",
      "And yeah, I think as I said on the press call, things are going well arguably a little bit better than we'd sort of modeled as part of the acquisition, and we're happy to see that.\n",
      "Matt O'Connor (Analyst): Okay. Thank you very much.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 1, Justification: The CFO provides a clear and direct answer, addressing both the 'run-off of loans' and 'opportunities to deepen relationships.' They explain the factors contributing to the current high performance of First Republic and discuss why it's not sustainable, while also confirming that deepening relationships remains a focus as integration continues. All aspects of the question are addressed with relevant information.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Matt O’Connor (Analyst): Okay. And then just separately, you bought back couple of billion dollars of stock this quarter. What's your thought process on buybacks given the strong capital generation, but also some uncertainty on regulatory proposals?\n",
      "Jeremy Barnum (CFO): Yeah. Good question. And I think you framed it exactly correctly in the sense that we obviously have a lot of buyback capacity in general based on our organic capital generation. So, the normal capital hierarchy will apply. But for now, we plan to remain on a modest pace of buybacks consistent with that kind of $2 billion net buyback a quarter number that we've talked about and that you've seen us do, in light of the – probably the need to continue building to have a bit of a buffer, as you said, the uncertainty about the finalization of the rules. And also just as a reminder, the SCB is probably a little bit low right now and has been quite volatile. So, that's another factor that we need to keep in mind.\n",
      "Matt O’Connor (Analyst): Okay. Thank you.\n",
      "Jeremy Barnum (CFO): Thanks, Matt.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 1, Justification: The CFO directly addresses the question about the buyback thought process, stating the current modest pace and providing specific reasons, including regulatory uncertainty and the Stress Capital Buffer. The answer is clear, specific, and fully addresses the analyst's concerns about both capital generation and regulatory proposals.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Mike Mayo (Analyst): Hi. I understand the Net Interest Income strategy benefited from First Republic, asset sensitivity, CD strategy, money in motion, and I'm curious to how much is the Net Interest Income increase and the deposit benefits a function of the 67 million digital banking customers? Do you have more digital banking customers than branch customers now? If you can just refresh that.\n",
      "And then a more general question. I guess I have the first one for Jeremy and the second one for Jamie. You have record tech spend. What's the benefit of having record tech spend, if you can kind of mark-to-market your thoughts there as it relates to Artificial Intelligence, as it relates to maybe wasted spending, your outlook for next year? And does it really help to be the biggest tech spender in the banking industry?\n",
      "Jeremy Barnum (CFO): Yes. Let me do digital banking, Mike. I spent some time on this actually a couple weeks ago. And it's interesting to note this sort of extent to which the growth in digitally engaged consumers is higher than the overall growth in consumer accounts, meaning that we're continuing to increase the percentage of our consumers that are digitally engaged. And it sort of goes back to my prior point...\n",
      "Jamie Dimon (CEO): But the percent who are digital only is much lower than that.\n",
      "Jeremy Barnum (CFO): For sure. For sure. Which actually links to the broader point that what – in terms of your question about how much is this helping the current Net Interest Income story, it goes to the larger point of it holistic through the cycle, multichannel, fully engaged customer strategy which requires a lot of investment in branches, obviously, but also in digital services of all sorts.\n",
      "So in many ways, you can see the current environment as a little bit of a payoff of that investment. But that's not like, therefore, we stop investing, obviously.\n",
      "So I guess that's part of the answer. And I guess your other question is the benefits of being the biggest tech spender. I just think like it's sort of mandatory, right? I mean we're big and it's a very technology-centric business, and the world is competitive, and everything is changing.\n",
      "Younger generations have different expectations, and we have to be nimble, and we have to be on our front foot. And otherwise, we risk getting severely disrupted. So I don't know if Jamie wants to add anything.\n",
      "Jamie Dimon (CEO): Just the competition, when we look at it, it's Wells, who's coming back, which I'm happy for you guys. It's obviously Marcus, it's Apple, it's Chime, it's Dave. There are a lot of people coming up after these businesses in different ways, and there some have been quite successful. It's Stripe in payments.\n",
      "And so we want to be very good and very competitive. Some of that tech spending is things which are almost a sine qua non, which is cybersecurity, data center resiliency, regulatory requirements, and things like that, which we simply are going to do and be very, very good at to protect the company.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 4, Justification: The management avoids providing specific quantitative figures requested regarding the impact of digital banking on NII and the comparison of digital vs. branch customers. Additionally, while explaining the necessity of tech spending, they do not address the specific inquiries about Artificial Intelligence, potential wasted spending, or the outlook for the next year's tech spend.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Mike Mayo (Analyst): And then lastly, I think you had made a mention at a conference about investment spend or tech spend over the next year. Where do you stand on that?\n",
      "Jeremy Barnum (CFO): Yeah. Now because you did ask a little bit about the expense outlook for next year. So I think at the conference we said, I think the consensus was $88 billion, but we're still going through the budget process, et cetera, et cetera. So that's still true.\n",
      "I think we're still kind of in the ballpark, but I would say at the margin there's going to be a little bit of upward pressure.\n",
      "Jamie Dimon (CEO): Is that for First Republic too, or no?\n",
      "Jeremy Barnum (CFO): Yeah, this is all now including First Republic. And I think there will be a little bit of upward pressure on that as we sort of do our usual thing and look at all of the opportunities that we see and the investments that we want to make. So no surprise in that sense that we're going to invest prudently. Nothing dramatic, but probably a little bit of upward pressure at the margin.\n",
      "Mike Mayo (Analyst): All right. Thank you.\n",
      "Jamie Dimon (CEO): Thank you.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 3, Justification: The response acknowledges the previous figure and gives a directional hint (\"upward pressure\") but avoids providing a specific updated number for investment or tech spend, citing the ongoing budget process. This keeps the answer vague and generic rather than direct.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Erika Najarian (Analyst): Thank you. And my second question is on maybe zooming out on the Basel III Endgame impacts. It's clearly complex, overly complex, and I completely agree with you that it is unnecessary at this point and very backward looking. I guess, what is not complex is the fact that you generated 75 basis points of Common Equity Tier 1 this quarter while your RWAs are down. And I guess my question here is, is that I understand that we're in the public advocacy process.\n",
      "I hear you loud and clear in terms of how this could have harm in terms of pricing for Main Street and dislocating the pipes in American capital markets. But for JPMorgan, does this change your natural return profile of 17%? Jamie, I know you lingered a little bit on 14% when you were at Barclays in September. But at the end of the day, it feels like for the portfolio managers that own JPMorgan through the cycle, does Basel III Endgame really harm your natural earnings power and returns?\n",
      "Jeremy Barnum (CFO): Yeah. Okay. That's a good question, Erika. I think there's a couple pieces in there, so let me take the most important piece first, which is the 17% through the cycle target. Are we keeping that or not in light of the Basel III Endgame proposal?\n",
      "So, short answer is we're not going to change that number today, but when you look at what we've disclosed about a 25% increase in capital, you have to start by acknowledging that that is a major headwind to returns.\n",
      "In simple terms, you talk about earnings power and returns, but they're two different things, right. We have to be a little bit pedantic and do numerator and denominator here. Okay, so say the numerator doesn't change. If you just dilute down the numerator by the increased capital, that's a significantly lower return number.\n",
      "I would say that that's probably the lower bound in terms of the impact of the Basel III Endgame for a couple reasons. One is, we are hoping for changes.\n",
      "Two is, once the rule is final, we will seek to reprice in the places where we can. And that'll be different in Consumer and Wholesale, some of it will be product level, some of it will be relationship level, but that hopefully can mitigate some of it but of course the flip side of that is that's cost getting passed into the real economy and that's part of the point that we've made about lowering availability of products and services and lending.\n",
      "There may be some opportunities for costless optimization. I'm personally a little bit more pessimistic about those, but we've surprised ourselves on those points in the past, so we'll see.\n",
      "And then finally, yeah, we may stop doing certain things and we may exit things. But, I wouldn't necessarily assume that that's going to do a lot to preserve returns at the 17%. That's going to be about exiting things that are shareholder-destructive, but not necessarily producing much higher returns, if you know what I mean.\n",
      "So that's that, and then the other part of your question implicitly was talking about organic capital generation and I think it's just very important to separate impacts on the economy and impacts on long-term returns from our ability to meet the requirements.\n",
      "Of course, as Jamie always says, JPMorgan is going to be fine and we're building a lot of capital and we were managing capital conservatively and we'll be able to build the necessary capital in order to achieve on-time or early compliance, which is always what we strive to do, but that doesn't really have any particular bearing on the question of what the long-term return target is or the impacts on the real economy.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 2, Justification: The CFO directly stated they would not change the 17% target \"today\" but immediately qualified this by acknowledging that the increased capital requirements represent a \"major headwind to returns.\" While the response did not provide a definitive quantification of the harm, it clearly explained the negative impact on returns due to capital dilution and outlined challenges in mitigating this impact, thus mostly addressing the question about harm to natural earnings power and returns.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Erika Najarian (Analyst): Thanks. And just as a follow-up, the $90 billion in expenses for 2024, does that contemplate a significant increase or the comeback of investment banking that everybody seems to be expecting for 2024?\n",
      "Jeremy Barnum (CFO): A little bit of that is in there, yeah. So, you would see that. We often talk about the volume in revenue related category, and I think in my prepared remarks, you will have noted that I talked about a $1 billion increase in that category year-on-year as a result of an improved Non-interest Revenue outlook. So, the hope and expectation of a continued rebound in the investment banking wallet and our share of that is part of that.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 1, Justification: The CFO directly confirms that the 2024 expense guidance \"contemplates\" an investment banking rebound. They further elaborate by linking it to a specific $1 billion increase in a revenue-related expense category, providing a direct and clear response to the analyst's inquiry.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Mike Mayo (Analyst): As it relates to Artificial Intelligence specifically, which is the talk of the town, I guess the consensus among people outside the banking industry is that banks will not win that battle, including JPMorgan. You won't control the front end. What are you doing with Artificial Intelligence to make a difference now, or is this just simply a moon shot?\n",
      "Jamie Dimon (CEO): Oh, I don't agree with that statement. Banks have an extraordinary amount of proprietary data in addition to when you do like a large language model, that's public data, looking at everything on the internet or everything that's ever been published or something like that.\n",
      "But Artificial Intelligence is an extraordinarily good tool to use. We just put a woman who's running it at our table. So it's data analytics, Artificial Intelligence, et cetera. And there are multiple types of Artificial Intelligence.\n",
      "So we use Artificial Intelligence for risk, fraud, marketing, prospecting. And the management team's getting better and better at saying how can we use the data to do a better job to reduce errors, to serve clients better, to have a salesperson have co-pilots so they know to widen the client's coin or something like that.\n",
      "And so, we simply have to do it. Does it create opportunity for disruptors to come in? Yeah, of course. That's always been true with technology. And, but, we'll be quite good at it.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 3, Justification: The CEO addresses the premise about banks not winning in AI and lists general areas where AI is being used (risk, fraud, marketing). However, the answer remains somewhat generic, and it does not provide specific examples or tangible details on how AI is *currently making a concrete difference* within the organization beyond broad categories and general statements about improving efficiency, which was a key part of the analyst's 'making a difference now' inquiry.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Gerard Cassidy (Analyst): Great. Thank you.\n",
      "Erika Najarian (Analyst): Hi. Good morning. Jeremy, my first question is for you, again sort of maybe re-asking the question in a different way. Your new guide for net interest income for this year would imply an exit run rate of $22.9 billion in the fourth quarter. As we think about the dynamics in higher-for-longer, on one hand, your fixed rate assets will continue to reprice. On the other, you even asked a lot about the deposit dynamics that could continue to creep higher. How do we think about those puts and takes as we think about that relative to that exit rate of $22.9 billion in the fourth quarter?\n",
      "Jeremy Barnum (CFO): Yeah. So, Erika, I think the simple answer to your question is I believe that fourth quarter exit number equates to a $90 billion run rate ex. Markets and we're kind of saying...\n",
      "Jamie Dimon (CEO): $22.5 billion.\n",
      "Jeremy Barnum (CFO): Yeah. Isn't that what I meant to say?\n",
      "Jamie Dimon (CEO): She said $22.9 billion.\n",
      "Jeremy Barnum (CFO): Oh, I didn't hear that, okay. Anyway...\n",
      "Jamie Dimon (CEO): We didn’t model it that way.\n",
      "Jeremy Barnum (CFO): So call it $90 billion run rate on an exit rate basis, and we're saying that we think something a bit more normal is closer to $80 billion, so that's one building block.\n",
      "Underneath that, I think one thing that's interesting actually, is that as the percentage of the deposits which are CDs increases, the sort of balance between internal migration and betas and rate and volume, it's a little bit less binary and a little bit smoother, so when we look at this type of stuff and we model migration, balances, product level reprice, as you get out of that lower zero bound with 0% CD mix world, things get a little bit smoother, I would say, overall.\n",
      "So it'll be interesting to watch that, but it's obviously one of the most important things for us as a company right now and we do everything we can to manage it, but it's also worth remembering that the big picture point is just the client franchise and as we've often said, we're very focused on primary bank relationships and we didn't lose any of those in the last cycle, and we're not planning to lose any in this cycle, and that's what sort of a long-term focus means for us.\n",
      "Jamie Dimon (CEO): And I would just add quantitative tightening in there. That will be a large number, and we don't exactly know the effect, where wholesale, consumer as – remember also the Fed has the RRP program which is also sucking money into the Fed directly and reducing deposits. That's still a trillion too.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 3, Justification: The answer partially addresses the question by clarifying the implied NII run rate and briefly discussing the impact of CD mix on deposit dynamics. However, it then broadens significantly to discuss general client franchise strategy and macroeconomic factors like quantitative tightening, rather than providing a detailed breakdown of the internal 'puts and takes' impacting their specific NII exit rate forecast.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Gerard Cassidy (Analyst): Jeremy, coming back to your outlook and forecast for net interest income for the upcoming year with the six Fed fund rate cuts that you guys are assuming, can you give us a little insight why you're assuming six cuts? Is it your customers are telling you that their businesses are weaker or is it your just economic outlook, the forward curve? Can you give us something behind why you're assuming so many rate cuts?\n",
      "Jeremy Barnum (CFO): Yeah. Gerard, I wish the answer were more interesting, but it's just our practice. We just always use the forward curve for our outlook, and that's what's in there.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 1, Justification: The CFO's answer is very direct. The analyst asked if the assumption of six rate cuts was due to customer feedback, economic outlook, or the forward curve, and the CFO explicitly stated they use the forward curve, directly addressing one of the analyst's specific inquiries without vagueness or deflection.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Jim Mitchell (Analyst): Right. That's helpful. Thanks.\n",
      "Matt O'Connor (Analyst): Hi, good morning. You talked about increased investment spend in some areas in response to an earlier question. But just how do you think about cost control overall, looking at the medium term? The outlook for revenue is obviously pressured at least on net interest income. Fees might help, but the backdrop is for potentially declining revenue or at least flattish revenue for a couple or few years. So, I know you always say you want to invest for the cycle, and it's really paid off over time, but how are you thinking about cost control the next few years?\n",
      "Jeremy Barnum (CFO): Yeah. I mean, I wish I had sort of an answer that fit better into your framework. But in some fundamental sense, we just kind of don't agree with the framework in the sense that and we've been through this over the last couple of years, right?\n",
      "In a world where rates drop very suddenly and recover like quite dramatically, and credit becomes abnormally good and then rebounds, and you've seen these very significant fluctuations in capital markets. We saw that in 2021 going into 2022 where the revenue environment can change a lot in the short term for reasons that can be largely out of your control.\n",
      "And while of course there are parts of our expense base, which are in the short term directly sensitive to the revenue environment and some of those adjust naturally and some of them we adjust more forcefully as a function of volumes, but other things are much more structural.\n",
      "And the goal is to make sure that those other things are sized appropriately to what we believe sustainable through the cycle returns are. So we're always very focused on cost. You can be rest assured of that. That discipline internally is as aggressive as ever as we go through the budget cycle. But there are long-term plays and you really shouldn’t expect us to see trying to generate cosmetically lower costs in response to a lower revenue environment where we didn’t balloon the costs when the revenue became as we’ve argued unsustainably high.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 4, Justification: The CFO largely avoids the analyst's specific question about \"how\" they are thinking about cost control for the \"next few years\" given potential revenue pressure. Instead of outlining concrete strategies, the CFO rejects the premise, explains their \"through the cycle\" investment philosophy for structural costs, and provides general assurances of cost discipline. This response sidesteps the call for specific medium-term cost control thoughts under the stated revenue conditions.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Mike Mayo (Analyst): Yeah. Can you just talk about the impact of Artificial Intelligence on your technology approach? And I know I’ve asked you this before and you said you're spending it, you're being careful, you want to see a return on your dollars. But how much difference can this make? How big is your tech budget last year? How much should it be this year? How much could Artificial Intelligence make a difference? Just a little more meat on the tech bones.\n",
      "Jeremy Barnum (CFO): Yeah, sure. So, let me address the Artificial Intelligence point, and I think maybe I won't go into a lot of quantitative detail on this stuff and I'll save that for Investor Day, if you don't mind. But, I will address the Artificial Intelligence point. So, as you may be aware, we actually have Teresa Heitsenrether now running the Artificial Intelligence strategy for the company as a member of the Operating Committee, which I think is an indication of the priority that we place on this, and in partnership with Lori and all of the technology organization.\n",
      "So, I think that – I think of this as being a little bit barbelled, where on the one hand, we're very excited about this. There's clearly some very significant opportunities, not for nothing, starting with technology developers themselves in terms of the opportunity for significantly increased productivity there. At the same time, we're JPMorgan Chase. We're not going to be chasing shiny objects here in Artificial Intelligence. We want to do this in an extremely disciplined way, it's very commercial and very linked to tangible outcomes. And so, the current focus is on making sure we have a contained, well-chosen list of high-impact use cases and that we're throwing resources at those in the right way, that's extremely pragmatic and disciplined, and we're holding ourselves accountable for actual results.\n",
      "Mike Mayo (Analyst): All right. Thank you.\n",
      "Jeremy Barnum (CFO): Thanks, Mike.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 4, Justification: The CFO explicitly stated they would not provide the requested quantitative details regarding the tech budget and AI impact, deferring them to Investor Day. While they offered a high-level qualitative overview of their AI strategy and priorities, they directly avoided the core financial inquiries from the analyst, which constituted a significant part of the question.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Erika Najarian (Analyst): Got it. Thank you.\n",
      "Glenn Schorr (Analyst): Hi. Thank you. So I very much appreciate the comments in the release on the big picture things, what's going on in the world and their potential impact on markets, on food markets, global trade, everything that you mentioned, and sadly agree about the most dangerous time in decades. The question I have is, does it surprise you that markets are hanging in, that you, yourself, have green shoots or still green shoots type of mindset about banking while that's going on? And then maybe more importantly, if you believe what obviously what you wrote, what are you doing about it? How do you manage yourself conservatively? How do you prepare for tougher times?\n",
      "Jamie Dimon (CEO): Go ahead, Jeremy.\n",
      "Jeremy Barnum (CFO): You want to start? Okay. So, I mean, on green shoots, you'll just note that our comments are cautious. I mean, there is momentum. I do think we are a little bit more optimistic than we were, but obviously, markets have been bumpy, both equity markets and rate markets have been very whippy recently.\n",
      "So we don't want to get too carried away with optimism here. We are coming in off a very low base and so there's a hope and an expectation that we are on the path to normalization and improvement.\n",
      "And of course, the overall economic picture at least currently looks solid, this sort of immaculate disinflation trade is actually happening. So those are all reasons to be a little bit optimistic in the near-term, but it's tempered with quite a bit of caution.\n",
      "Jamie Dimon (CEO): So I would add a question. There has been an extraordinary amount of fiscal monetary stimulus still in the system, and you can't look at, and of course, it can drive markets in sentiment and sales and profits and all that, but you can't stay like this forever.\n",
      "Between QT, if you never had and how much the fiscal stimulus could continue at this rate before you have kind of the crowding out kind of factor. So I think people have to be very cautious, and of course, the geopolitics I think is just an extraordinary issue we have to deal with. How do you prepare the company for that?\n",
      "We do 100 stress tests a week, and we do multiple views of it, including geopolitical problems, interest rate problems, but usually, geopolitics presents itself as a deep recession or a mild recession, or a recession part of the world, or markets going down a lot, and because markets do well is not a reason, ever, to say that they are going to continue to do well.\n",
      "If you don't believe me, remember 1987, 1990, 1994, the year 2000, the year 2009, and people don't predict those inflection points. But my caution is that we are facing so many uncertainties out there. You just got to be very cautious with what you're facing.\n",
      "And like I said, the other thing about the green shoots, regardless of that, we try to run the company so that we serve the clients day in and day out, better products and better services, securely, safely, and all those things, so that's the ultimate goal.\n",
      "We know there are going to be bad times. That's not a surprise that there are going to be bad times. We don't always know how they're coming, and where they're coming from, but we'll keep on serving clients and doing good for clients, you can build a good business kind of separate from what it does to your returns. That's a slightly different issue at this point, but we'll deal with that too when we figure out what to do.\n",
      "Glenn Schorr (Analyst): Thank you for all that, all good.\n",
      "Jeremy Barnum (CFO): Thanks, Glenn.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 2, Justification: The management largely addressed both parts of the analyst's question. While the CFO provided a nuanced, rather than direct, answer regarding \"surprise\" about market resilience, the CEO thoroughly explained their approach to preparing for tougher times, detailing their extensive use of stress tests for various scenarios, including geopolitical risks. The response was comprehensive and specific on risk management strategies.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Jim Mitchell (Analyst): Right. Okay. Thanks a lot.\n",
      "Ebrahim H. Poonawala (Analyst): Hey. Good morning. I guess maybe one question looking at your statement, and I think Jamie is quoted as saying as he sees the consumer as resilient and the market expecting a soft landing. I would love to hear – I'm not sure Jamie's on the call – but maybe, Jeremy, I would love to hear your thoughts around do you believe that the outlook for a soft landing has increased? Is the market pricing in correctly? Or when you look at your customer base, are you still worried about the lagged effects of the rate hikes?\n",
      "Jeremy Barnum (CFO): Right. Okay, Ebrahim. So, I think a lot of those things aren't actually mutually exclusive. So, statement one, I think it's uncontroversial that the economic outlook has evolved to include a significantly higher probability of a soft landing. That's, I think, the consensus at this point. So, whether you believe it or not is a separate issue, but I think that is the consensus.\n",
      "In terms of consumer resilience, I made some comments about this on the press call. The way we see it, the consumer is fine. All of the relevant metrics are now effectively normalized. And the question really, in light of the fact that cash buffers are now also normal, but that that means that consumers have been spending more than they're taking in, is how that spending behavior adjusts as we go into the new year in a world where their cash buffers are less comfortable than they were.\n",
      "So, one can speculate about different trajectories that that could take. But I do think it's important to take a step back and remind ourselves that consistent with that soft landing view, just in the central case modeling – obviously, we always worry about the tail scenarios – is a very strong labor market. And a very strong labor market means, all else equal, strong consumer credit. So, that's how we see the world.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 4, Justification: The CFO directly addresses the increased probability of a soft landing but avoids stating his personal belief, deferring to market consensus. Crucially, the answer completely bypasses the question regarding whether the market is pricing in the outlook correctly. While he discusses consumer resilience and potential spending adjustments, he frames it with a positive outlook on the labor market rather than directly addressing worries about lagged effects of rate hikes.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Matt O’Connor (Analyst): Good morning. Thanks for all the comments on the net interest income. Any updates on that medium term outlook that you've put out there?\n",
      "Jeremy Barnum (CFO): Yeah. Matt, not particularly updating. I think you're referring to that $80 billion number that we'd put out there, and I wouldn't exactly describe that as an outlook. I think it's more just a number that we put out there to try to quantify a little bit the extent of the over earning. So, not particularly necessary to revise the number. But I just would point out, again, as we highlight on the page, and as I highlighted in the prepared remarks, that when you look at that $94 billion exit rate and full year guidance of $88 billion, that implies obviously exiting below $88 billion and some significant sequential decline. So, in that sense, you can see us kind of marching on the path to that $80 billion. Whether we ever get to the $80 billion or not and when is maybe a topic for later in the year or next year.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 4, Justification: The CFO directly states they are \"not particularly updating\" the medium-term outlook. They then redefine the $80 billion figure as not an \"outlook\" but a \"quantification of over-earning,\" and explicitly defer when or if the company will reach that number to a later date. This response directly avoids providing the requested update on the medium-term outlook.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Ebrahim H. Poonawala (Analyst): Got it. Thank you.\n",
      "Erika Najarian (Analyst): Hi. Good morning. My first question is a follow-up on Matt's with regarding the buyback. You printed 15% Common Equity Tier 1 in the quarter. On a net basis, net of Risk-Weighted Assets growth, your net income produces 51 basis points every quarter. Again, that's net of Risk-Weighted Assets growth. I'm wondering what guideposts you're looking for, Jeremy, in terms of that buyback increasing from that $2 billion a quarter. Do we need to wait for Basel III finalization, which seems like it could be quite delayed? Or will having clarity in the June D-FAST results – you mentioned the SCB – sort of be enough that you could reconsider this pace over the medium term?\n",
      "Jeremy Barnum (CFO): Yeah. Erika, that's a good question. And I understand what you're asking – why you're asking it. I think the answer is going to be a little bit unsatisfying, which is that this is classic decision-making under uncertainty and it's kind of a probabilistic cloud of a variety of different factors. But, all the ingredients that you've listed are the right ingredients; right, very strong organic capital generation, uncertainty about the finalization of the rule, uncertainty about the SCB requirements, and obviously, our normal capital hierarchy, which is that buybacks are always at the bottom of the hierarchy after we're done using the capital for our other priorities.\n",
      "So, I think what I said previously stands, which is that we're sticking with the modest pace for now. But obviously, we have a lot of flexibility to adjust that whenever we want under the current regime, and we may well do that.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 4, Justification: The CFO acknowledges the question and confirms the factors mentioned are relevant \"ingredients.\" However, he avoids specifying which guidepost (Basel III finalization or D-FAST/SCB clarity) would trigger an increase in buybacks, instead referring to it as a \"probabilistic cloud of a variety of different factors\" and \"decision-making under uncertainty.\" This provides a general context without offering the specific triggers or clarity requested by the analyst.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Jim Mitchell (Analyst): Okay. And then if it weren't to change, and you talked about the potential negative impact on liquidity in the Markets business specifically, is that a JPM pulling out of certain businesses type event? Or is it more a comment that there'd be fewer providers of liquidity as less scaled players exit, and maybe that's almost equal a market share gain opportunity for JPMorgan in a smaller business?\n",
      "Jamie Dimon (CEO): I think so if you look at Markets alone, it's a huge, I think 60%, increase in capital. And if you look at it, you can do that by product. For some products it's worse than for others, but generally it's bad across all products.\n",
      "But the really important thing is market making is a critical function and if you look at the world, only some of these large market makers who could make markets for governments, hospitals, cities, schools, states, IMF, World Bank, BlackRock, Blackstone, and all those various things who buy and sell for their clients in size.\n",
      "And market makers have a different function than hedge funds, and I don't know what the real intent was with this. This is another one I think that needs to be really thought through with what are you trying to accomplish.\n",
      "We do market making quite safe. We've never lost the kind of money that people talk about in market making in the global market shock or something like that, but the other thing about market making, I do agree, it could actually force some people out.\n",
      "It will force lower positions which is why I think it's a little risky, but it may also force more consolidation. And so clients, since they need it so much, there may be consolidation in an unintended way in market making and obviously more volatile markets because with all the constraints, with the Liquidity Coverage Ratio Market., SLR, capital, et cetera, you will constantly be up against limitations in what you can do.\n",
      "Jeremy Barnum (CFO): Yeah. And I think that last point of Jamie's is particularly important because, sure, if you want, you can construct what I would consider a very optimistic argument that the higher cost of doing business will lead smaller scale players to exit and that's a share gain opportunity for us, but if I refer back to the comments about the disincentives to beneficial diversification and scale, getting bigger, especially in markets is quite expensive from, for example, a Global Systemically Important Banks perspective, and so you wind up kind of hemmed in on all sides which is one of the reasons why we're sort of highlighting, but it does seem like the only way out, sometimes, when you look at the cumulative effect of everything that's happened in markets over the last 15 years, is a fundamentally very different system, and while obviously...\n",
      "Jamie Dimon (CEO): Great opportunity for European market makers. I mean, a great opportunity, like they can do repo and Foreign Exchange and swaps and credit and stuff with 30% less capital. That is a big difference in that kind of business.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 4, Justification: The executives discuss the broader implications of regulations on market making and the industry structure, including potential consolidation, but largely avoid directly answering whether JPMorgan itself would pull out of specific businesses. While they acknowledge the 'share gain opportunity,' they heavily qualify it by emphasizing the increased costs and regulatory disincentives for large banks, thus redirecting from a direct assessment of JPM's strategic response.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Manan Gosalia (Analyst): Hey. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. There has been a lot of talk about capital markets rebound. You noted you're starting the year with a healthy pipeline. Could you give us some more color on what you're seeing there and how the rate in – how the change in the rate environment is changing the conversations that you're having across Mergers & Acquisitions, Equity Capital Markets and Debt Capital Markets?\n",
      "Jeremy Barnum (CFO): Yeah, sure. So, as you know, all else equal, this more dovish rate environment is of course supportive for capital markets. So, if you go into the details a little bit, if you start with Equity Capital Markets, that helps. Higher and – well, the recent rally in the equity markets helps. I think there've been some modest challenges with the 2023 IPO vintage in terms of post-launch performance or whatever. So, that's a little bit of a headwind at the margin in terms of converting the pipeline, but I'm not too concerned about that in general. So, I would expect to see rebound there.\n",
      "In Debt Capital Markets, again, all else equal, lower rates are clearly supportive. One of the nuances there is the distinction between the absolute level of rates and the rate of change, that sometimes you see corporates seeing and expecting lower rates, and therefore, waiting to refinance in the hope of even lower rates. So, that can go both ways. And then, Mergers & Acquisitions is a slightly different dynamic. I think there's a couple nuances there. One, as you obviously know, announced volume was lower this year. So, that will be a headwind in reported revenues in 2024, all else equal. And of course, we are in an environment of Mergers & Acquisitions regulatory headwinds, as has been heavily discussed. But having said that, I think we're seeing a bit of pick-up in deal flow, and I would expect the environment to be a bit more supportive.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 1, Justification: The CFO directly addresses the impact of the changing rate environment on each of the three capital market segments (ECM, DCM, M&A) as requested by the analyst. The response provides specific color on trends, headwinds, and tailwinds for each area, demonstrating a clear and comprehensive answer.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Ebrahim H. Poonawala (Analyst): And maybe just taking that a step further, there has been concern around whether we see some of the Commercial Real Estate pain filter into multi-family apartments. You all have a pretty large multi-family exposure, high quality. But just give us a sense of, one, are you seeing any bleed-through of what we've seen in office in other areas of commercial real estate or any particular parts of C&I lending? Thank you.\n",
      "Jeremy Barnum (CFO): Yeah. So, good question on the multi-family, and the short answer is that, for us, it's pretty uncontroversially no – no bleed-through. And the reason is that while we are aware of some of the pressure on multi-family, that's in kind of different markets from the ones that we are actually big in. So, it's higher-end stuff in much less supply constrained markets that is under more pressure. And as you know, our multi-family portfolio is much more affordable, supply constrained markets. And so, the performance there remains really very robust.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 3, Justification: The CFO provided a clear and specific answer regarding the multi-family portfolio, directly addressing that part of the question. However, the response completely omitted any mention of C&I lending or other areas of commercial real estate, which were also explicitly asked about by the analyst. Therefore, while one part of the question was answered directly and thoroughly, the overall response was only partial.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "John McDonald (Analyst): Okay. Thanks.\n",
      "Jim Mitchell (Analyst): Hey. Good morning. Maybe just to follow up in a different way on the Net Interest Income question, just in deposits, can you, Jeremy, discuss your assumptions on the reprice and migration thoughts? And then, layering in if we do get six cuts, does that start to change the dynamic around growth in deposits? How are you thinking about all that?\n",
      "Jeremy Barnum (CFO): Yeah. Both good questions. So let's do reprice first. So, I think all else equal, this more dovish Fed environment and these six cuts has the effect of taking a little bit of pressure off the reprice, especially product-level reprice. At the same time, we do continue to expect internal migration, particularly out of checking and savings into CDs, and in Wholesale, a little bit of ongoing migration out of non-interest-bearing into interest-bearing.\n",
      "And that trajectory, I would expect to continue even in a lower rate environment. So, as a result, if you look at weighted average rate paid, for example, for the consumer deposit franchise, we would actually expect that number to be a little bit higher, just even in a world with six cuts. And that's actually intuitive when you think about it, as people continue migrating into CDs, but maybe a little non-intuitive if you're kind of trying to do beta type math with like change in rates and change in rate paid. It gets a little bit non-intuitive.\n",
      "And then, in terms of balances, yeah, you'll note that I said that our outlook is for balances to be very modestly down, which when you consider the QT, despite the various speculations about having it slow down later in the year, continues and that loan growth in the system as a whole is expected to be quite muted. It's a pretty modest decline outlook consistent with the lower rates. So, I kind of agree with you that this environment is at the margin, a little bit more supportive for system-wide deposit balances. And then, obviously, we continue to be optimistic about our ability to take share in deposits based on our customer value proposition across all of our different businesses.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 1, Justification: The CFO directly addresses both aspects of the analyst's question. He clearly discusses the assumptions on reprice and internal deposit migration in the context of six rate cuts, providing specific insights into the expected impact on weighted average rate paid and overall deposit balances, leaving little to no ambiguity.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Glenn Schorr (Analyst): Hi. Thank you. So, I want to get your perspective on private credit overall. The industry saw a lot of growth, but it's only so big relative to the banking market. I think there's been a lot of share shift in direct lending and middle market lending. But now, you're starting to see more in asset-backed finance and you're seeing them raise a lot of money in infrastructure and energy.\n",
      "So, my question to you is, how big of a trend is this? How much do you think about it as cyclical versus secular? And most importantly, how does JPMorgan adapt and participate?\n",
      "Jeremy Barnum (CFO): Yeah. Thanks, Glenn. So, I think the last part of your question, as you say, is the most important part, which is this as an important factor in the competitive dynamic and what is one of the key things that we offer as a company. So, it is a meaningful shift in the environment and something that we've been watching for some time.\n",
      "We've made some enhancements and some new initiatives to ensure that we can compete effectively both in our traditional syndicated lending businesses, but also go head-to-head with the private credit providers in these types of unitranche structures, if and when that's what the client actually wants. It tends to be a trade-off between the best possible pricing versus speed and certainty of execution, and we can provide both off our sort of exceptionally strong long-time Debt Capital Markets franchise. So, that's been a priority, and we're actually already starting to see some results from that across both the Commercial Bank and the CIB with certain client segments.\n",
      "And in the bigger picture, of course, in the context of the Basel III Endgame, people talk a lot about the risk of certain lending activity getting pushed out of the regulated perimeter. It's important to be clear, right, these are important clients of ours too. We compete with them. They're also clients. And in the end, our point here is just people, and regulators in particular, should just be aware of the likely consequences of what's happening here and make sure that the results are intentional and that we're looking around the corner a little bit.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 3, Justification: The CFO's answer directly addresses the scale of the private credit trend and how JPMorgan is adapting to it. However, the answer completely bypasses the analyst's specific inquiry about whether the trend is cyclical versus secular, leaving a key part of the question unanswered.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "John McDonald (Analyst): Okay. And then, just to follow up on the Net Interest Income, could you give us some sensitivity to that outlook when you flex the amount of Fed cuts? Like what's the impact of a few Fed cuts and how much does it matter like for the first two versus if you're thinking four, five, six? I know it's complicated, but maybe a little bit of color on like how sensitive you are to a couple of cuts might be helpful.\n",
      "Jeremy Barnum (CFO): Sure. Yeah, happy to do that, John. So, I think probably the best way to do this is to look at our EaR numbers. So, as you know, we don't update that until the Q. But on an estimated basis, it's going to be a little bit lower. So, I think something like $1.9 billion as opposed to $2.1 billion. So, just round numbers, about $2 billion in EaR. I think, empirically, the number is maybe a little higher than that just because even though we do model lags in the EaR, we've been seeing the lag effect be a little bit bigger. But just crudely, I think as I noted, we do remain asset-sensitive. That's one way to quantify it. I would say the empirical number would maybe be a little higher than that, and hopefully, that gives you enough to work with.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 3, Justification: The CFO provides a relevant Earnings at Risk (EaR) estimate to indicate interest rate sensitivity, which partially addresses the question about Net Interest Income outlook. However, the answer does not provide the specific breakdown or 'flexing' of sensitivity based on varying numbers of Fed cuts (e.g., impact of two cuts vs. four or six cuts) as the analyst specifically requested, making it somewhat generic.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Gerard Cassidy (Analyst): Okay, very good. And then, as a follow-up, obviously, you pointed out also in the outlook you're going to have some deposit attrition. You had some, of course, in 2023. Can you guys give us some insights on the impact QT is having on the deposit base for your organization? And second, are you surprised that QT hasn't been more disruptive to the liquidity in the markets?\n",
      "Jeremy Barnum (CFO): Yeah. Good question, Gerard. I mean, I think you've heard Jamie talk about this a lot. QT is obviously a big focus and one of the complicating elements that we have in the current environment. I think that the math is the math in the sense that QT, all else equal, is withdrawing from system-wide deposits. In the last six months of this year, that's been offset, hopefully, by a reduction in the size of RRP. And so, that's been supportive of system-wide deposits.\n",
      "As we go into 2024, RRP is at lower levels, and so that may be a little bit less of a tailwind. But it's also the case, as you know, that there's – the market's expectation is that QT is going to start slowing down at some point this year. So – and we still have reasonable levels of reserves and some cushion from RRP. So, that's part of the reason that our outlook is for deposits to be modestly down, with the shrinkage in system-wide deposits maybe partially offset by our belief that we can take some share. But, also I think the second half of this year is going to be interesting to watch in terms of what the Fed does.\n",
      "Gerard Cassidy (Analyst): Great. Thank you.\n",
      "Jeremy Barnum (CFO): Thanks, Gerard.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 3, Justification: The CFO provides a detailed explanation of system-wide deposit dynamics and offers a general outlook for the firm's deposits in relation to QT. However, they avoid directly stating whether they are 'surprised' by QT's market impact, instead explaining the mitigating factors. The insights into their specific deposit base are also high-level rather than offering deeper, specific 'insights' into the impact.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Glenn Schorr (Analyst): Anything specific on asset-backed? It's an important part of your business too. Do you see it following the same path as direct lending has?\n",
      "Jeremy Barnum (CFO): It's interesting. I haven't heard much about that, Glenn. So, we can look into it for you. But to be honest, the fact that I haven't heard much makes me think that it's maybe not such a big driver right now.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 5, Justification: The CFO explicitly states a lack of information, directly avoiding both parts of the question regarding specifics on the asset-backed business and its potential path. The response provides no relevant information about the business segment asked about, effectively deferring the answer.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Erika Najarian (Analyst): Thank you.\n",
      "Mike Mayo (Analyst): Hi. So, you're guiding to $90 billion of expenses, that's up $7 billion year-over-year. Seems like quite a big increase. And if you could just give some color on that. I know we've been through this before two years ago with the big increase in expenses and without a lot of visibility. So, if you could just upfront give us visibility, how much of that is due to incentive pay, how much is that due to tech, how much is that due to Artificial Intelligence and what are the expected returns to get from that $7 billion pick-up? Thanks.\n",
      "Jeremy Barnum (CFO): Yeah. Mike, thanks for the question. And yeah – and of course, you will, as I noted, be hearing more from us at Investor Day and between now and Investor Day. But I will take a little bit of extra time here to answer your question, because you're right, it's important to give you the transparency. And I'm going to follow the structure that we used on the page and go through each line of business.\n",
      "So, starting with Citi Commercial Bank, it's the biggest dollar driver overall. It's an 8% increase year-on-year, which is about the same as we had last year. One key driver is the branch strategy and the associated staff for that. In 2023, we built 166 new branches, and we're planning about a similar number this year. Marketing is also a driver. We're seeing great opportunities, great demand and engagement in our Card products. And so, that shows up in marketing. And as you well know, our wealth strategy in Citi Commercial Bank remains a big focus and priority.\n",
      "I think it's worth noting here, right, that as we've talked about and as you know, Mike, some of our investments are designed to produce short-term payoffs and some of them are much longer-term and some of them are just table stakes. But we actually see quite a bit of evidence of current payoffs in our current results in the Citi Commercial Bank investment. So, for example, in 2023, we had 2 million net new checking accounts. We had an 8% growth in active card accounts. And over the last three years, we've increased deposit market share by 180 basis points. So, as we've often said about the company as a whole, we're very happy to be producing very good current returns and growth while investing for the future.\n",
      "In AWM, continued client advisor hiring is a key driver, as well as making sure that both the advisors and all of their new clients have the support that they need. And a little bit to the prior question, in AWM, we also have a little bit of volume and revenue-related driver tied to an improved revenue outlook.\n",
      "The Commercial Bank is an interesting story in the sense that about half of it is the exit rate impact of ads that we did in the middle of the year based on market disruption and all the kind of new clients and new loans that we saw and the need to support that across the entire ecosystem. As well as the fact that that created an opportunity in the middle of the year to accelerate our longstanding and preexisting innovation economy strategy. So, we took some opportunities to onboard some key teams in different parts of the franchise. And then, as you look into 2024, it's really pretty consistent themes to the ones that we had before, including hiring bankers both domestically and internationally.\n",
      "The CIB story is a little bit different. The percentage growth there is lower, which recognizes, I think, both our very, very strong share positions as a starting point and also the fact that we've been investing quite aggressively for some time in the Payments business, which has produced meaningful payoffs already there in terms of significant share gains. So, as a result, the biggest driver in the CIB is really generic inflation, including labor as well as, again to the prior question, volume and revenue-related increases tied to the improved Non-interest Revenue outlook. And I do want to say for the avoidance of doubt that despite all of this, our core strategy of looking very granularly at all the areas of strength and weakness and making sure that we're upgrading where appropriate to have absolutely the best talent in the CIB remains fully in effect.\n",
      "Finally, you'll note that I haven't actually talked about technology in any of the businesses, and that's actually because even though all of the businesses in various ways are investing in technology and spending money on it, the drivers are actually very consistent across the entire firm, even though it's very bottoms-up driven. And those drivers are consistent with what they've been, new products, features and customer platforms, as well as modernization. So, that's happening throughout the company both at the app level and otherwise. And I will say actually in closing, talking about technology – which I think is interesting – that to the point about a driver being growth writ large, one of the things that we see is higher volume-related technology expense throughout the company. So, thanks for the question, Mike. It was a good opportunity to give you guys a bit more color here.\n",
      "Mike Mayo (Analyst): Okay. I have a short follow-up. I'm still here.\n",
      "Jeremy Barnum (CFO): Sure.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 4, Justification: The CFO provided a detailed breakdown of expense drivers by business segment, offering qualitative insights into where the money is being spent. However, he did not directly answer the analyst's specific quantitative questions regarding how much of the $7 billion increase is attributable to incentive pay, technology, or Artificial Intelligence. The question about AI was completely unaddressed, and expected returns were only vaguely covered for specific segments rather than the overall increase, indicating a strategic redirection of the answer.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Charles W. Peabody (Analyst): Just to make sure I understood what you're saying, so you have Net Interest Income ex. Markets going from $94 billion to $88 billion. Within that, would the contribution from First Republic be down as well or up?\n",
      "Jamie Dimon (CEO): It's going to hit… the day we did it, so...\n",
      "Jeremy Barnum (CFO): Yeah. I mean, I can probably answer that question if I think about it for a second, but it sort of violates my prior statement that I really don't want to get into the business of guiding on First Republic. If I do the big picture, right, so big picture, 2023, we had eight months of First Republic Net Interest Income. 2024, we're going to have 12. So, all else equal, there's calendarization in there. What's also true is that in 2023, as a result of the impact of the Net Interest Income of the pull to par of certain relatively short-dated assets that we fair-valued at a meaningful discount as part of the transaction, that sort of – that pull to par happens quite quickly, and therefore, probably juiced the 2023 number a little bit. So, therefore, straight annualization is probably not the right way to think about it. Then, you just get into the questions about the FTP and the funding and whatever, and then this is like too complicated. So, I'd rather not go there.\n",
      "Charles W. Peabody (Analyst): All right. Thank you.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 5, Justification: The CFO explicitly states he does \"not want to get into the business of guiding on First Republic\" and concludes by saying \"I'd rather not go there\" because it's \"too complicated.\" Despite providing some general context about First Republic's NII, he directly refuses to answer whether its contribution would be up or down, making it a clear and very evasive response.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Jim Mitchell (Analyst): Hey. Good morning. Jeremy, can you speak to the trends you're seeing with respect to deposit migration in the quarter, if there's been any change? Have you seen that migration start to slow or not?\n",
      "Jeremy Barnum (CFO): Yeah. Good question, Jim. I think the simplest and best answer to that is: not really. So, as we've been saying for a while, migration from checking and savings to CDs is sort of the dominant trend with this driving the increase in weighted average rate paid in the consumer deposit franchise, that continues. We continue to capture that money-in-motion at a very high rate. We're very happy about what that means about the consumer franchise and level of engagement that we're seeing.\n",
      "I'm aware that there's a little bit of a narrative out there about are we seeing the end of what people sometimes refer to as cash sorting. We've looked at that data. We see some evidence that maybe it's slowing a little bit. We're quite cautious on that. We really sort of don't think it makes sense to assume that in a world where checking and savings is paying effectively zero and the policy rate is above 5% that you're not going to see ongoing migration.\n",
      "And frankly, we expect to see that even in a world where – even if the current yield curve environment were to change and meaningful cuts were to get reintroduced and we would actually start to see those, we would still expect to see ongoing migration and yield-seeking behavior. So, it's quite conceivable and this is actually on the yield curve that we had in fourth quarter that had six cuts in it. We were still nonetheless expecting an increase in weighted average rate paid as that migration continues. So, I would say no meaningful change in the trends and the expectation for ongoing migration is very much still there.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 1, Justification: The CFO directly addresses the analyst's question about changes in deposit migration and whether it has started to slow, stating \"not really\" and \"no meaningful change.\" He clearly explains the ongoing trend of migration to CDs and provides a rationale for expecting it to continue, directly answering the query about current trends and potential changes.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "John McDonald (Analyst): Okay. Got it. And then just to follow up to make it super clear on the idea of the Markets Net Interest Income, that outlook being revised down by $1 billion but revenue neutral. I guess, the obvious thing is, there, there's typically an offset in fee income and you don't guide to that. But the idea would be the way you're structuring trades, the way the balance sheet is evolving, there’s some offset that you'd expect in Markets fees from the lower Markets Net Interest Income, correct?\n",
      "Jeremy Barnum (CFO): That is exactly right. And specifically, what's going on here is there's shift between on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet in the financing businesses and prime and so on within Markets. And you can actually see a little bit of a pop in the Markets balance sheet in the supplement and these things are all related.\n",
      "So, fundamentally, you can think of it as like we either hold the equities on the balance sheet, non-interest-bearing, high-funding expense, negative for Net Interest Income, or we receive that in total return form through derivatives, exactly the same economics, no impact on Net Interest Income. So, that shift is a function of the sort of borrowing relationships in the marketplace in ways that are bottom line effectively neutral. It's second order effects, but they change the geography quite a bit, and that's what happened this quarter. And that's why we've been emphasizing for some time that the Net Interest Income ex. Markets is the better number to focus on in terms of an indicator of how the core banking franchise is performing.\n",
      "John McDonald (Analyst): Got it. Thank you.\n",
      "Jeremy Barnum (CFO): Thank you.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 1, Justification: The CFO directly confirms the analyst's understanding that the reduction in Markets Net Interest Income is offset by changes in fee income. The explanation provided is clear and specific, detailing the shift between on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet activities that results in the revenue neutrality.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Manan Gosalia (Analyst): Great. And on the flip side, in C&I, you spoke about lower revolver utilization, more muted demand. What would it take for that to rebound? Do you think it accelerates from here if rates come down or is there room for this to slow even further if the capital markets open up even more?\n",
      "Jeremy Barnum (CFO): Yeah. It's a good question. I mean, I think as you say, it's a little bit of a – I mean, I wouldn't necessarily say that, like, lack of debt market access in the last year, that was more of an earlier effect in terms of having that drive revolver utilization. I think the main driver there is just a little bit of residual anxiety in the C-suite, which increases as the companies get smaller in size.\n",
      "So, it's really going to be a function of how 2024 plays out. The softer the landing is, the more supported the utilization should be, I would think. If things turn out a little bit worse, I think management teams are going to be incrementally more cautious about CapEx and so on, and so you might see utilization even lower.\n",
      "Manan Gosalia (Analyst): Great, thank you.\n",
      "Jeremy Barnum (CFO): Yeah.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 2, Justification: The CFO directly identifies 'residual anxiety in the C-suite' as the main driver for muted demand, which addresses what is currently needed for a rebound. The response then links future utilization to broader economic conditions and a 'softer landing,' providing a clear, albeit general, explanation for how it would accelerate or slow. While not giving precise, quantitative triggers, the answer sufficiently addresses the question with a logical framework.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Glenn Schorr (Analyst): Okay, cool. Thank you for that.\n",
      "Charles W. Peabody (Analyst): Thank you. I have a question about the role that First Republic plays in your Net Interest Income forecast. I'm assuming, because you'll have a full year in 2024 of First Republic that their contribution of Net Interest Income will be up, let's say, from $3.7 billion this year to $5 billion to $6 billion next year. But given that you're forecasting six rate cuts, is that a detractor to your assumptions of Net Interest Income from First Republic? Or – I mean, you have that Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation note, and then you also have a significant amount of adjustable rate mortgages that I assume are repricing upwards. So, if you're talking about rate cuts, that would hurt your Net Interest Income forecast from First Republic, I'm guessing. But if rates stay higher for longer, wouldn't First Republic be a much bigger contributor? So, talk about the sensitivities of First Republic there.\n",
      "Jeremy Barnum (CFO): Yeah. Thanks, Charlie. So, one thing that we said when we kind of gave First Republic guidance at Investor Day earlier this year is that while we understood the need to track that, and we've been splitting out First Republic in our reported results in order to improve period-on-period comparability, we kind of want to stay out of the business of guiding on First Republic.\n",
      "And so, we really focused on having our guidance be Firmwide, including First Republic, now that everything is embedded in the franchise.\n",
      "Having said that, let me just react to a couple of the things that you said. So, again, I don't want to get into like micro-validation one way or the other of some of your back-of-the-envelope math. But we did have some accelerated pull to par on some of the accretion of some of the loans that we purchased this year. So, I think the annualization that you're doing is maybe a bit high for the 2024 number. And then, from a sensitivities perspective, I actually think I can simplify the math for you a little bit and just kind of direct you to the EaR per my response to the prior question. Because that EaR fully includes all of the First Republic assets and liabilities with all of the various dynamics. And so, I think that's kind of like an easier way to think about it for the company.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 4, Justification: The CFO explicitly states they want to avoid providing specific guidance for First Republic, choosing to focus on firm-wide numbers instead. While they do correct the analyst's NII estimate for First Republic, they clearly avoid the core of the question regarding First Republic's specific sensitivities to rate cuts by redirecting to a firm-wide earnings at risk (EaR) metric.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "John McDonald (Analyst): Thanks. Jeremy, you had mentioned at a conference earlier this year that the Street might need to build in more reserve growth – for the Card growth, you've had more reserve build. We didn't see that this quarter. Is that just kind of seasonal? And would you still expect the kind of growth math to play out in terms of Card growth and reserve build needs?\n",
      "Jeremy Barnum (CFO): Yeah, John. So, in short, yes to both questions. So, yes, the relative lack of build this quarter is a function of the normal seasonal patterns of Card. Yes, we still expect 12% Card loan growth for the full year. And yes, that still means that all else equal, we think the consensus for the allowance build for the back three quarters is still a little too low, if you map it to that expected Card loan growth.\n",
      "Obviously, there's the wild card of what happens with our probabilities and our parameters and the output of our internal process of assessing the skew in the seasonal distribution and so on, and we're not speaking to that one way or the other. So, if guys have your own opinions about that, that's fine, but we're narrowly just saying that based on the Card loan growth that we expect and normal coverage ratios for that, we do expect build in the back half of the year.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 1, Justification: The CFO provides a very direct response, explicitly answering \"yes\" to both parts of the analyst's question. They confirm the seasonal nature of the current quarter's reserve build and reiterate the expectation for future reserve growth aligned with card loan growth, even stating that current consensus is too low. While they acknowledge internal \"wild card\" factors, they clearly state they are not speaking to those, maintaining the clarity of their main answer based on expected loan growth.\n",

The CFO's response completely avoids addressing the question of his well-being, providing no relevant information to the query.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Betsy L. Graseck (Analyst): So, a couple of questions here. Just, one, Jamie, could you talk through the decision to raise the dividend kind of mid-cycle, it felt like, pre-Comprehensive Capital Analysis? And also, help us understand how you're thinking about where that payout ratio, that dividend payout ratio, range should be. Because over the past several years, it's been somewhere between 24% and 32%. And so, is this suggesting we could be towards the higher-end of that range or even expanding above that?\n",
      "And then I also just wanted to understand the buyback and the keeping of the Common Equity Tier 1 at 15% here. The minimum is 11.9%. I know it's – we have to wait for Basel III Endgame re-proposal to come through and all that, but should we be expecting that, hey, we're going to hold 15% Common Equity Tier 1 until we know all these rules? Thanks.\n",
      "Jamie Dimon (CEO): Yeah. So, Betsy, before I answer the question, I want to say something on behalf of all of us at JPMorgan and, me personally, thrilled to have you on this call. For those that don't know, Betsy has been through a terrible medical episode and it's a reminder to all of us how lucky we are to be here. But, Betsy, in particular, the amount of respect we have, not just in your work, but in your character over the last 20 plus years has been exceptional. So, on behalf of all of us, I just want to welcome you back and thrilled to have you here.\n",
      "And so, you're asking a pertinent question. So, we're earning a lot of money. Our capital cup runneth over, and that's why we've increased the dividend. And if you're asking me what we'd like to do is to pay out something like a third, a third of normalized earnings. Of course, it's hard to calculate always what normalized earnings are, but we don't mind being a little bit ahead of that sometimes, a little bit behind that sometimes.\n",
      "If I could give people kind of consistent dividend guidance, et cetera, I think the far more important question is the 15%. So, look at the 15%, I'm going to oversimplify it, that basically will prepare us for the total Basel Endgame today, roughly. The specifics don't matter that much.\n",
      "Remember, we can do a lot of things to change that in the short-run or the long-run, but it looks like Basel III Endgame may not be the worst case. It'll be something less than that. So, obviously, when and if that happens, it would free up a lot of capital, and I'm going to say in the order of $20 billion or something like that.\n",
      "And, yes, we've always had the capital hierarchy the same way, which is we're going to use capital to build our business first, I mean, pay the dividend – steady dividend, build the business, and if we think it's appropriate to buy back stock. We're continuing to buy back stock at $2 billion a quarter (sic). I personally do not want to buy back a lot more than that at these current prices. I think you've all heard me talk about the world, things like that. So, waiting in preparation for Basel. Hopefully we'll know something later, and then we can be much more specific with you all.\n",
      "But in the meantime, there's also – it's very important to put in mind, there are short-term uses for capital that are good for shareholders, that could reduce our Common Equity Tier 1 too. So, you may see us do things in the short-run that will increase earnings, increase capital, that are using up that capital. Jeremy mentioned on the – on one of the things that we know, the balance sheet and how we use the balance sheet for credit and trading, we could do things now.\n",
      "So, it's a great position to be in. We're going to be very, very patient. I urge all the analysts to keep in mind, excess capital is not wasted capital, it's earnings in store. We will deploy it in a very good way for shareholders in due course.\n",
      "Betsy L. Graseck (Analyst): Excellent. Thank you so much.\n",
      "Jeremy Barnum (CFO): And yeah, Betsy, I just wanted to add my welcome back thoughts as well, and just a very minor edit to Jamie's answer. I think he just misspoken when he said $2 billion a year in buybacks. The trajectory is $2 billion...\n",
      "Jamie Dimon (CEO): Oh. Sorry. $2 billion a quarter. Yeah.\n",
      "Jeremy Barnum (CFO): ...a quarter. Otherwise, I have nothing to add to Jamie's very complete answer. But welcome back, Betsy.\n",

      "Evasiveness Score: 2, Justification: The CEO directly addressed all parts of the question, including the reason for the dividend increase, the target payout ratio (around a third of normalized earnings), and the rationale for holding a 15% Common Equity Tier 1 ratio in preparation for Basel III Endgame. While there was an extended personal preamble and minor vagueness around 'normalized earnings' and general future capital deployment, the core inquiries were clearly answered.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Glenn Schorr (Analyst): Thank you. Your commentary with Ken's questions were great and clear on Investment Banking for the near term in this year. I have a bigger picture question in terms of, you're always so good in spelling out where you're over-earning. Do you feel like you're under-earning on the Investment Banking side? And I just use some of your own numbers from the past of like, the market has added like $40 trillion of equity market cap and $40 trillion of fixed income market cap last 10 years, yet the wallet is like 20% plus below the 10-year average. So, is there just a bigger upside and it's just a matter of when, not if.\n",
      "Jeremy Barnum (CFO): Yeah, Glenn. In short, yes. I mean, I think we're not shy about saying that we're under-earning in Investment Banking right now. Clearly, we're below cycle averages, as you point out. We've been talking about when do we get back to the pre-pandemic wallet? But as you know, I mean on this point, what it was, like March 2020, right, was the beginning of the pandemic. So, it's like four years ago at this point. So, there has been Gross Domestic Product growth, especially in nominal terms during that period, and you would expect the wallet to growth with that.\n",
      "So, I do think there's meaningful upside in the Investment Banking fee wallet. As I've noted, there are some headwinds, I think particularly in Mergers & Acquisitions. But over time, you would hope that the amount of Mergers & Acquisitions is a function of the underlying industrial logic rather than the regulatory environment. So, you could see some mean reversion there. And, yeah, so that's why we're sort of leaning in. We're engaging with clients. We're making sure that we're appropriately resourced for a more robust level of the wallet and fighting for every dollar of share.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 1, Justification: The CFO directly answers \"yes\" to both parts of the analyst's question regarding under-earning in Investment Banking and the potential for a bigger upside. The response is clear, specific, and elaborates on the drivers and headwinds affecting the timing of a recovery in the wallet, fully addressing the \"when, not if\" aspect.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Ken Usdin (Analyst): Got it. And I guess, I'll just stick on the theme of capital markets, and not surprising at all to see a little bit tougher comp in FICC. I think you guys have kind of indicated that maybe a flattish fee pool is a reasonable place, and I know that's impossible to guide on. But just, maybe talk to some of the dynamics in terms of activity across the Fixed Income and Equities business. And do you feel like this is the type of environment where, given that lingering uncertainty about rates, clients are either more engaged or less engaged in terms of how they're positioning portfolios? Thanks.\n",
      "Jeremy Barnum (CFO): Yeah. Really good question. I would say, in general, that the sort of volatility and uncertainty in the rate environment overall on balance is actually supportive for the Markets revenue pool. And I think that, together with generally more balance sheet deployment as well as sort of some level of natural background growth, is one of the reasons that the overall level of Markets revenue has stabilized at meaningfully above what was normal in the pre-pandemic period.\n",
      "And well, that does occasionally make us a little bit anxious like, “Oh, is this sustainable? Might there be downside here?” For now, that does seem to be the new normal. And I do think that having rates off the lower zero bound and a sort of more normal dynamic and global rates, that not only affects the rates business, but it affects the Foreign Exchange business. It generally just makes asset allocation decisions more important and more interesting.\n",
      "And so, all of that creates risk management needs and active managers need to grapple with it, and so on and so forth. So, I think that – those are some of the themes on the Market side at the margin. And yeah, we'll see how the rest of the year goes. But it sort of seems to be behaving relatively normally, I would say.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 2, Justification: The CFO directly addresses how rate uncertainty impacts client engagement, stating it is supportive for the Markets revenue pool and elaborating on why it drives risk management and asset allocation needs. While not providing a granular breakdown of FICC versus Equities dynamics, the response thoroughly explains the underlying factors influencing activity across the broader capital markets business, making it mostly direct.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Jim Mitchell (Analyst): Okay. And just a follow-up on that and just sort of bigger picture on Net Interest Income. Is that sort of the biggest driver of your outlook? Is it migration? Is it the forward curve? Is it balances? It sounds like it's migration, but just I'd be curious to hear your thoughts on the biggest drivers of upside or downside.\n",
      "Jeremy Barnum (CFO): Yeah. So, I mean I think the drivers of, let's say, what's embedded in the current guidance is actually not meaningfully different from what it was in the fourth quarter, meaning it's the current yield curve, which is a little bit stale now. But the snap from quarter-end had roughly three cuts in it. So, it's the current yield curve, it's what I just said, the expectation of ongoing internal migration. There is some meaningful offset from Card revolve growth, which while it's a little bit less than it was in prior years, is still a tailwind there.\n",
      "We expect deposit balances to be sort of flat to modestly down, so that's a little bit of a headwind at the margin. And then, there's obviously the wild card of potential product level reprice, which we always say we're going to make those decisions situationally as a function of competitive conditions in the marketplace, and you know this obviously, but in a world where we've got something like $900 billion of deposits paying effectively zero, relatively small changes in the product level reprice can change the Net Interest Income run rate by a lot. So, the error bands here are pretty wide, and we're always going to stick with our mantra, which has been not losing primary bank relationships and thinking about the long-term health of the franchise when we think about deposit pricing.\n",
      "Jim Mitchell (Analyst): Right. Okay. Great. Thanks for the color.\n",
      "Jeremy Barnum (CFO): Thanks.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 2, Justification: The CFO directly addresses the question by listing several specific drivers of Net Interest Income, including the yield curve, migration, and deposit balances as prompted, and adds other relevant factors like card revolve growth and product reprice. While he doesn't explicitly name a single 'biggest' driver, he thoroughly explains the potential impact and direction of each, providing a detailed and mostly direct answer to the analyst's inquiry about the factors influencing NII.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Ebrahim H. Poonawala (Analyst): That's helpful. And just tied to that, as we look at commercial real estate both for J.P. and for the economy overall, is higher rates alone enough to create more vulnerability than issues beyond office Commercial Real Estate? Like, how would you characterize the health of the Commercial Real Estate market? Thank you.\n",
      "Jamie Dimon (CEO): Yeah, so I'll put it into two buckets. Okay? First of all, we're fine. We've got good reserves against office. We think our multifamily is fine. Jeremy can give you more detail on that if you want.\n",
      "But if you think of real estate, there's two pieces. If rates go up, think of the yield curve. The whole yield curve, not Fed funds, but the 10-year bond rate, it goes up 2%, all assets, all assets, every asset on the planet, including real estate, is worth 20% less. Well, obviously, that creates a little bit of stress and strain, and people have to roll those over and finance it more. That's not just true for real estate, it's true for everybody. And that happens, leveraged loans, real estate will have some effect.\n",
      "The second thing is the, why does that happen? If that happens because we have a strong economy, well, that's not so bad for real estate because people will be hiring and throwing things out and other financial assets. If that happens because we have stagflation, well that’s the worst case.\n",
      "All of a sudden, you are going to have more vacancies, you are going to have more companies cutting back, you are going to have less leases. It will affect – including multifamily, that will filter through the whole economy in a way that we – people haven't really experienced since 2010.\n",
      "So, I just put in the back of your mind the why is important, the interest rates are important, the recession is important. If things stay where they are today, we have kind of the soft landing that seems to be embedded in the marketplace, everyone will – the real estate will muddle through. Obviously, it will be idiosyncratic if you're in different cities and different types and B versus A buildings and all of that, but people muddle through. They won't muddle through under higher rates with the recession. That would be tough for a lot of folks and not just real estate if, in fact, that happens.\n",
      "Ebrahim H. Poonawala (Analyst): Helpful. Thank you so much.\n",
      "Jeremy Barnum (CFO): Thanks, Ebrahim.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 4, Justification: The CEO avoids directly characterizing the overall health of the commercial real estate market. While he briefly states J.P. Morgan's portfolio is 'fine,' he then generalizes the impact of higher rates to 'all assets' and shifts the discussion to hypothetical future economic scenarios (strong economy vs. stagflation) rather than providing a clear assessment of the market's current health and specific vulnerabilities beyond office.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Ebrahim H. Poonawala (Analyst): Hey. Good morning. I guess, just in terms of, Jeremy, when you think about the outlook for the economy, I would appreciate your thoughts on the health of the customer base, both commercial and consumer. And when we think about higher-for-longer, maybe the economy is too strong so we don't get any rate cuts, are you seeing that when you talk to your customers and the feedback you're getting from your bankers where the momentum is picking up?\n",
      "And I appreciate all the macro risks that Jamie has pointed out, but I'm just getting – trying to get to a sense of what your view is in terms of the most likely outcome based on what you're seeing today from the customers.\n",
      "Jamie Dimon (CEO): I would say consumer customers are fine. The unemployment is very low. Home prices are up. Stock prices are up. The amount of income they need to service their debt is still kind of low, but the extra money of the lower-income folks is running out – not running out, but normalizing, and you see credit normalizing a little bit. And of course, higher-income folks still have more money, they're still spending it. So, whatever happens, the customer is in pretty good shape and they're – if they – you go into a recession, they'll be in pretty good shape.\n",
      "Businesses are in good shape. If you look at it today, their confidence is up, their order books are up, their profits are up. But what I caution people, these are all the same results of a lot of fiscal spending, a lot of QE, et cetera. And so, we don't really know what's going to happen. And I also want to look at the year. Look at two years or three years, all the geopolitical effects and oil and gas and how much fiscal spending will actually take place, our elections, et cetera.\n",
      "So, we're in good shape – we're okay right now. It does not mean we're okay down the road. And if you look at any inflection point, being okay in the current time is always true. That was true in 1972. It was true in any time we've had it. So, I just – I'm just on the more cautious side. How people feel and confidence levels and all that, that doesn't necessarily stop you from having an inflection point. And so, everything is okay today, but you've got to be prepared for a range of outcomes, which we are.\n",
      "And the other thing I want to point out, because all of these questions about interest rates and yield curves and Net Interest Income and credit losses, it's – one thing to project it today based on what – not what we think in economic scenarios, but the generally accepted economic scenario, which is the generally accepted rate cuts of the Fed, but these numbers have always been wrong.\n",
      "You have to ask the question, what if other things happen like higher rates with this modest recession, et cetera? Then all these numbers change. I just don't think any of us should be surprised if and when that happens. And I just think the chance of happening is higher than other people. I don't know the outcome. We don't want to guess the outcome. I've never seen anyone actually positively predict big inflection point in the economy, literally in my life or in history.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 4, Justification: Jamie Dimon provides a direct assessment of the current health of both consumer and commercial customers. However, he largely avoids the analyst's core forward-looking questions about whether momentum is picking up and what the \"most likely outcome\" for the economy is. Instead of offering a predictive view, he emphasizes the high degree of uncertainty, the historical inability to predict economic inflection points, and the need to be prepared for a wide range of outcomes, effectively redirecting from a specific forecast.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Matt O’Connor (Analyst): Got it. And then just separately, within the Consumer Card businesses, you highlighted volumes were up 9% year-over-year. Obviously, still a very strong piece. Any trends within that that are worth noting in terms of changes in spend category? Either overall or among certain segments? Thank you.\n",
      "Jeremy Barnum (CFO): Maybe a little bit. Jamie already alluded somewhat to this. So, I do think spend is fine but not boomy, broadly speaking, I would say. You can look at it a lot of different ways: inflation, cohorts, et cetera. But when you kind of triangulate that, you get back to this kind of flattish picture. There is a little bit of evidence of substituting out of discretionary into nondiscretionary.\n",
      "And I think the single most notable thing is just this effect, where in the – while it is true that real incomes have gone up in the lowest income cohorts, within that there's obviously a probability distribution. And there's some – or rather just a distribution of outcomes. And there are some set of people whose real incomes are not up, they're down, and who are therefore struggling a little bit unfortunately. And what you observe in the spending patterns of those people is, some meaningful slowing rather than what you might have feared which is sort of aggressive levering up.\n",
      "So, I think that's maybe an economic indicator of sorts, although this portion of the population is small enough that I'm not sure the reader cost is that big. But it is encouraging from a credit perspective because it just means that people are behaving kind of rationally and in a sort of normal post-pandemic type of way as they manage their own balance sheets, and that's sort of the margin good news from a credit perspective.\n",
      "Matt O’Connor (Analyst): Okay. That's helpful. Thank you very much.\n",
      "Jeremy Barnum (CFO): Thanks.\n",
      "Gerard Cassidy (Analyst): Hi, Jeremy.\n",
      "Jeremy Barnum (CFO): Hey, Gerard. How are you doing?\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 2, Justification: The answer mostly addresses the question. The CFO directly mentions a trend of 'substituting out of discretionary into nondiscretionary' spending and elaborates on the spending patterns within 'lowest income cohorts,' which are specific trends among certain segments as requested by the analyst. While not an exhaustive list of all categories, the response provides relevant and specific insights.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Erika Najarian (Analyst): Got it. And just as a follow-up question, you mentioned that the current curve that you set your Net Interest Income outlook upon is stale. I guess, does it matter that – it seems like the market down pricing, and obviously no June cut, no September cut and a toss-up in December, which should matter for this year. As we think about that $90 billion, if we price rate cuts out totally, does that matter much given it seems like June is the only one that would...\n",
      "Jeremy Barnum (CFO): Yeah. Sorry, Erika. So, just quick things on this. One, let's focus on Net Interest Income ex., not on total Net Interest Income. So, I'd anchor you to the $89 billion. Number two, if you want to do math for like the changes of the average funds rate for the rest of the year and multiply that times the EaR like, be my guest, it's like as good as an approach as any.\n",
      "But I would just once again remind you of the $900 billion of deposits paying practically zero, that very small changes there can make a big difference. And we've got other factors. We've got the impact of QT on deposit balances, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. So, we want to make sure that we don't get too precise here. We're giving you our best guess based on a series of assumptions and it's going to be where it's going to be.\n",
      "Jamie Dimon (CEO): Which we know are going to be wrong.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 4, Justification: The answer largely avoids directly addressing how the revised market expectations for interest rate cuts would specifically impact the company's Net Interest Income outlook. Management deflects the question by suggesting the analyst do her own calculations and emphasizes other complex, unquantified factors, explicitly stating a desire not to be \"too precise.\"\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Mike Mayo (Analyst): Just as a follow up to that then, why is it doing great in terms of Wholesale Payments, given such the – the dislocations in the world from wars to supply chain changes, everything else? Why is Wholesale Payments doing great?\n",
      "Jeremy Barnum (CFO): Well, I think one of the things about Payments businesses is that, in some sense they are – I mean, recession proof is probably the wrong word; and in any case, we're not dealing with the recession. We're talking fundamentally about moving money through pipes around the world, and that's a thing that people need to do more or less, no matter what. So, that's one piece.\n",
      "But I think the other piece is that, our willingness to invest which has always been a focus of yours, is one of the key things separating us in this business right now. And so, we are seeing the benefits of that.\n",
      "Mike Mayo (Analyst): Alright. Thank you.\n",
      "Jeremy Barnum (CFO): Thanks, Mike.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 1, Justification: The CFO's answer is very direct. He provides two clear reasons why Wholesale Payments is performing well: the inherent resilience and necessity of payment businesses regardless of global dislocations, and the firm's strategic investment in the business. Both points directly address the analyst's question about why the segment is doing great despite current world events.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Gerard Cassidy (Analyst): Good. Thanks. Notwithstanding your guys' outlook for uncertainty, and of course Jamie talked about it in his shareholder letter and addressed it also on this call when he was here earlier. Can you guys share or can you share with us the color on what's going on in the corporate lending market in terms of spreads seem to be getting tighter? It's not reflecting, I don't think, a real fear out there in the global geopolitical world. And any color just on what you guys are seeing in the leveraged loan market as well?\n",
      "Jeremy Barnum (CFO): Right. So, I think what's true about spreads in general, just broadly credit spreads including secondary markets and to some extent the leverage lending space, is that they are exceptionally tight. So, I'm sure that's reversed a little bit in the last few days. But broadly throughout the quarter, we've really seen credit spreads tighten quite a bit. You even see that a little bit in our OCI this quarter, where losses in OCI that we would've had from higher rates have been meaningfully offset by tighter credit spreads in the portfolio. So broadly, sort of in keeping with the big run-up that we saw in equity markets and the general sort of bullish tone, you saw quite a bit of credit spread tightening in secondary markets.\n",
      "That, I think, has manifested itself a little bit in the leverage lending space in the normal way that it does, and that there's a lot of competition among providers for the revenue pool, and you start to see a little bit of loosening of terms which always makes us a little bit concerned. And as we have in the past, we are going to be very well prepared to lose share in that space if we don't like the terms. We never compromise on structure there. So, you are seeing a little bit of that.\n",
      "I think that, away from the leverage lending space in the broader C&I space, there was a moment a few months ago where I think, in no small part, as a result of banks generally anticipating this more challenging capital environment and sort of disciplining a little bit their lending, you're seeing a little bit of widening actually in those corporate lending spreads. I don't know if that trend has like survived over the last few weeks, and it was little bit hard to observe in any case.\n",
      "But I would say broadly, the dynamics are the tension between people trying to be careful with their balance sheets and the fact that overall asset prices and conditions are quite supportive and secondary market credit spreads have rallied a lot.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 1, Justification: The CFO's answer is very direct and comprehensive. They confirm the observation of tightening spreads, explain the dynamics in the leveraged loan market (competition, loosening terms, and their firm's strategy), and even provide nuanced color on the broader C&I lending space. The response directly addresses all parts of the analyst's question with specific observations.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Erika Najarian (Analyst): Thanks.\n",
      "Ken Usdin (Analyst): Thanks. Good morning. Jeremy, I was wondering if you could expand a little bit on one of your prepared comments. When you talked about, we'll have hopes and expectations for the Investment Banking pipeline that continued to move along, we obviously saw the good movement in Equity Capital Markets and Debt Capital Markets and the lag in Advisory. Can you just talk about that?\n",
      "You mentioned like potential cautiousness around the election. Just what are you hearing from both the corporate side and the sponsor side with – as it relates to Mergers & Acquisitions on like go-no-go type of feel and conversation levels? And then, what are you thinking we need to have to kickstart just another good level of IPO activity in the Equity Capital Markets markets? Thanks.\n",
      "Jeremy Barnum (CFO): Sure. Yeah. Let me take the IPO first. So, we have been a little bit cautious there. Some cohorts and vintages of IPOs had performed somewhat disappointingly. I think that narrative has changed to a meaningful degree this quarter. So I think we're seeing better IPO performance. Obviously, Equity Markets have been under a little bit of pressure last few days. But in general, we have a lot of support there and that always helps.\n",
      "Dialogue is quite good. A lot of interesting different types of conversations happening with global firms, multinationals, carve-out type things. So, dialogue is good. Valuation environment is better, like sort of decent reasons for optimism there. But of course, with Equity Capital Markets, there's always a pipeline dynamic and conditions were particularly good this quarter. And so, we cautioned a little bit there about pull-forward. Which is even more acute I think on the Debt Capital Markets side, given that quite a higher percentage of the total amount of debt that needed to be refinanced this year, has gotten done in the first quarter. So, that's a factor.\n",
      "And then, the question of Mergers & Acquisitions I think is probably the single most important question, not only because of its impact on Mergers & Acquisitions, but also because of it's knock-on impact on Debt Capital Markets through acquisition, financing and so on. And there is the well-known kind of regulatory headwinds there and that's definitely having a bit of a chilling effect. I don't know, I've heard some narratives that maybe there is like some pent-up deal demand. Who knows how important politics are in all this? So, I don't know.\n",
      "We're fundamentally, as I said, I think on the press call, happy to see momentum this quarter. Happy to see momentum in announced Mergers & Acquisitions. A little bit cautious about the pull-forward dynamic. A little bit cautious about the regulatory headwinds. And in the end, we're just going to fight really hard for our share of the wallet here.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 3, Justification: The CFO directly addresses the IPO activity question, detailing positive signs like improved performance and valuation environment. However, when asked about M&A client sentiment and the specific impact of the election, the response becomes vague, stating \"Who knows how important politics are in all this? So, I don't know,\" and doesn't provide specific insights into client \"go-no-go\" conversations.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Matt O'Connor (Analyst): Good morning. I was just wondering if you can elaborate on essentially the math behind the ROTCE being too high at 20% and more normalized at 17%. Obviously, you've pointed to overearning on Net Interest Income. And I guess, the question is, is that all of it to go from 20% to 17%? And if so, is that all consumer deposit costs or are there a few other components that you could help frame for us?\n",
      "Jeremy Barnum (CFO): Sure. Good question, Matt. I mean, I guess, the way I think about it is a couple of things, like our returns tend to be a bit seasonal, right? So, if you kind of build yourself out a full-year forecast and make reasonable, just based on your own or analyst consensus or whatever and you think about fourth quarter, like better look at this on a full-year basis when you think about the returns than the quarterly numbers and you obviously have to strip out kind of the one-time items.\n",
      "And so, if you do that, like whatever you get for this year, is still clearly a number that's higher than the 17%. So, yeah, one source of headwinds is normalization of the Net Interest Income, primarily as a result of expected higher deposit costs. That's – we've talked about that. Part of it is also the yield curve effects. Some cuts will come into the curve at some point.\n",
      "And in the normal course, if you kind of do a very, very, very simple mental model of the company, you would have, like revenues growing at some organic Gross Domestic Product, like rate maybe higher, and expenses growing at a similar slightly lower rate producing a sort of relatively stable overhead ratio. But even if the amount of Net Interest Income normalization winds up being less than we might have thought at some prior point, you still have some background – you still have some normalization of the overhead ratio that needs to happen.\n",
      "So, as much as our discipline on expense management is as tight as it always has been there, inflation is still non-zero. There are still investments that we're executing. There's still higher expense to come in a slightly flatter revenue environment as a result of, in part, the normalization of Net Interest Income.\n",
      "And then, the final point is that whatever winds up being the answer on Basel III Endgame and all the other pieces, you have to assume some amount of expansion of the denominator, at least based on what we know so far. So, of course, any of those pieces could be wrong, but that's kind of how we get to our 17%.\n",
      "And if you look at the various scenarios that we showed on the last page of my Investor Day presentation, it illustrates those dynamics and also how much the range could actually vary as a function of the economic environment and other factors.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 1, Justification: The CFO directly and comprehensively addresses the analyst's question about the components driving the ROTCE normalization from 20% to 17%. The response clearly outlines three key factors: normalization of Net Interest Income (due to deposit costs and yield curve), normalization of the overhead ratio (due to expenses and investments), and potential expansion of the capital denominator (Basel III Endgame), going beyond the initial focus on NII and consumer deposit costs as requested.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Erika Najarian (Analyst): Hi. Good morning. Given that your response to Betsy's question is that 15% Common Equity Tier 1 today prepares you for Basel III Endgame as written, you earn 22% on – without the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation assessment. Ahead of Investor Day, I guess, six weeks from now or a week from now, as we think about that 17% through-the-cycle target, if you're at the right capital level per you guys, where are you over-earning today?\n",
      "Jeremy Barnum (CFO): Right. So, interesting framing of the question, Erika. So, I think we've been pretty consistent about where we're over-earning, right? So, obviously, one major area is that we're over-earning in deposit margin, especially in consumer and that's sort of why we're expecting sequential declines in Net Interest Income, why we've talked about compressing deposit margins and increases in weighted average rate paid. So, I think that's probably the single biggest source of, let's call it, excess earnings currently.\n",
      "You also have heard Jamie say that we're over-earning in credit. I mean, Wholesale charge-offs have been particularly low, but we have builds for that. So, in the current run rate, a bit less clear the extent of what we're earning. And in Card, of course, while charge-offs are now close to normalized essentially, we did go through an extended period of charge-offs being very low by historical standards, although that was coupled with Net Interest Income also being low by historical standards. So, from a bottom line perspective, it's not entirely clear what the net of that was. But broadly, it's really deposit margin that's the biggest single factor in the over-earning narrative.\n",
      "Embedded in your question, I think, is a little bit of the “what are you thinking about the 17% Common Equity Tier 1 in light of the current level of capital” and so on and you did talk about Investor Day. I was hoping that we would have interesting things to say about that at Investor Day in light of potential updates of the Basel III Endgame, given that the single most important factor for that 17% is how much denominator expansion do we see through the Basel III Endgame.\n",
      "At the rate we're going, we won't actually know that much more about that by Investor Day, so we might not have that much more to say except to reiterate what I've said in the past which is that, whatever it is, it's going to be very good, our returns in absolute terms, very good in relative terms. We will optimize, we will seek to reprice, we will adjust in various ways to the best of our ability. But given the structure of the rule as proposed at least, a lot of this cannot be optimized away. And so, in the base case you have to think of it as a headwind.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 3, Justification: The CFO directly answers the first part of the question regarding areas of over-earning, specifically pointing to deposit margins. However, for the second part concerning the 17% through-the-cycle capital target and Investor Day, the CFO explains that current regulatory uncertainty prevents a specific answer. While not entirely evasive, this portion of the response acknowledges the question but provides little new or concrete information, deferring a more complete discussion to when regulatory clarity emerges.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Matt O’Connor (Analyst): Good morning. You mentioned one use of capital is to lean into the trading businesses with your balance sheet. And we just see the trading assets going up Q2, which is probably seasonal, but also up a lot year-over-year, but not necessarily translate into higher revenues. And I know they don't like match up necessarily each quarter, but maybe just elaborate like how you're leaning into the trading with the balance sheet and how you expect that to benefit you over time.\n",
      "Jeremy Barnum (CFO): Yeah, sure. So, let me break this question down into a couple of different parts. So, I think what Jamie was sort of suggesting is that, you can think of the concept as kind of like strategic capital versus tactical capital for lack of a better term. And what he's kind of saying is that, in a moment where you're carrying a lot of excess capital sort of for strategic reasons, you have the ability at least in theory to deploy portions of that with kind of like – into relatively short-duration assets or strategies or client opportunities in whatever moment for whatever reason, and what might be thought of as a tactical sense.\n",
      "So, he's just pointing out that that's an option that you have. And the extent to which this quarter's increase in Markets Risk-Weighted Assets is a reflection of that, maybe a little bit, but probably not. I agree with you that it's hard in any given quarter to specifically link the change in capital and Risk-Weighted Assets to a change in revenue versus too many moving parts there.\n",
      "But for sure, one thing that's true is the higher run rate of the Markets businesses as a whole that we talked about a second ago, is linked also to higher deployment of balance sheet into those businesses. So, as you well know, we pride ourselves on being extremely analytical and extremely disciplined in how we analyze capital liquidity, balance sheet deployment, Global Systemically Important Banks capacity utilization, et cetera, in the Markets business. And we don't just chase revenue; we go after returns fully measured. And that's part of the DNA, and we continue to do it and we will.\n",
      "So – that we still are operating under multiple binding constraints. And obviously, the environment is complex, so the ability to sort of throw a ton of capital at opportunities is not quite that simple always. But big picture, we are clearly in a very, very strong capital position which is, in no small part in anticipation of all the uncertainty, but it does also mean that if opportunities arise between now and when the Basel III Endgame is final, we are very well positioned to take advantage of those opportunities.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 3, Justification: The answer provides a theoretical framework (strategic vs. tactical capital) and acknowledges the balance sheet deployment in trading but lacks specific details on how they are actively 'leaning in' beyond general concepts. It also avoids directly addressing how this strategy is expected to specifically benefit them over time, instead offering broad statements about being disciplined and well-positioned for future opportunities. Thus, it is somewhat vague and only partially addresses the core of the question.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Ken Usdin (Analyst): Thanks a lot. Good morning, Jeremy. Jeremy, great to see the progress on Investment Banking fees up sequentially and 50% year-over-year, and I saw you on the tape earlier just talking about still regulatory concerns a little bit in the advisory space and we clearly didn't see the debt pull-forward play through because your Debt Capital Markets was great again. I'm just wondering just where you feel the environment is relative to the potential and just where the dialogue is across the three main bucket areas in terms of, like how does this feel in terms of a current environment versus a potential environment that we could still see ahead. Thanks.\n",
      "Jeremy Barnum (CFO): Yeah. Thanks, Ken. It's progress, right? I mean, we're happy to see the progress. People have been talking about depressed banking fee wallet for some time and it's nice to see not only the year-on-year pop from a low base, but also a nice sequential improvement. So, that's the first thing to say.\n",
      "In terms of dialog and engagement, it's definitely elevated. So, the dialog on Equity Capital Markets is elevated, and the dialog on Mergers & Acquisitions is quite robust as well. So, all of those are good things that encourage us and make us hopeful that we could be seeing sort of a better trend in this space.\n",
      "But there are some important caveats. So, on the Debt Capital Markets side, yeah, we made pull-forward comments in the first quarter, but we still feel that this second quarter still reflects a bunch of pull-forward and therefore, we're reasonably cautious about the second half of the year. Importantly, a lot of the activity is refinancing activity as opposed to, for example, acquisition finance.\n",
      "So, the fact that Mergers & Acquisitions remains still relatively muted in terms of actual deals has knock-on effects on Debt Capital Markets as well. And when a higher percentage of the wallet is refied, then the pull-forward risk becomes a little bit higher.\n",
      "On Equity Capital Markets, if you look at it kind of at a remove, you might ask the question, given the performance of the overall indices, you would think it would be a really booming environment for IPOs for example. And while it's improving, it's not quite as good as you would otherwise expect, and that's driven by a variety of factors, including the fact that, as has been widely discussed, the extent to which the performance of the large indices is driven by, like a few stocks, the sort of mid-cap tech growth space and other spaces that would typically be driving IPOs have had much more muted performance.\n",
      "Also, a lot of the private capital that was raised a couple years ago was raised at pretty high valuations. And so, in some cases, people looking at IPOs could be looking at down-rounds, that's an issue.\n",
      "And while secondary market performance of IPOs has improved meaningfully, in some cases people still have concerns about that. So, those are a little bit of overhang on that space. I think we can hope that over time that fades away and the trend gets a bit more robust.\n",
      "And, yeah, on the advisory side, the regulatory overhang is there, remains there, and so, we'll just have to see how that plays out.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 1, Justification: The CFO's answer is very direct and specific. They explicitly address the 'dialogue and engagement' being elevated across ECM and M&A, and then provide detailed explanations for the current environment versus potential for each segment (DCM, ECM, and Advisory), citing specific factors like pull-forward, market concentration, and regulatory overhang.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Ken Usdin (Analyst): Great. Thank you for all that, Jeremy. And just one on the Consumer side, just anything you're noticing in terms of people just have been waiting for this delinquency stabilization on the Credit Card side. Obviously, your loss rates are coming in as you expected, and we did see 30 days pretty flat and 90 days come down a little bit. Is that seasonal? Is it just a good rate of change trend? Any thoughts there? Thanks.\n",
      "Jeremy Barnum (CFO): Yeah. I still feel like when it comes to Card charge-offs and delinquencies, there's just not much to see there. It's still – it's normalization, not deterioration. It's in line with expectations.\n",
      "As I say, we always look quite closely inside the cohort, inside the income cohorts. And when you look in there, specifically, for example, on spend patterns, you can see a little bit of evidence of behavior that's consistent with a little bit of weakness in the lower income segments where you see a little bit of rotation on the spend out of discretionary into non-discretionary.\n",
      "But the effects are really quite subtle and in my mind definitely entirely consistent with the type of economic environment that we're seeing, which while very strong and certainly a lot stronger than anyone would have thought given the tightness of monetary conditions, say, like they've been predicting it a couple of years ago or whatever, you are seeing slightly higher unemployment, you are seeing moderating Gross Domestic Product growth.\n",
      "And so, it's not entirely surprising that you're seeing a tiny bit of weakness in some pockets of spend. So, it all kind of hangs together in what is in some sense actually not a very interesting story.\n",
      "Ken Usdin (Analyst): Thank you.\n",
      "Jeremy Barnum (CFO): Thanks, Ken.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 4, Justification: The CFO avoids directly answering whether the observed delinquency stabilization is seasonal or a good rate of change trend. Instead, the CFO downplays the significance by stating \"not much to see there\" and that it's \"normalization,\" then pivots to a broader discussion about subtle weaknesses in lower-income spend patterns and the general economic environment.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Charles W. Peabody (Analyst): Good morning. A couple of questions on the First Republic acquisition. Some of us obviously thought that would be a homerun, and I'm glad to see that Jamie Dimon validated that in his annual letter. When you look at the first quarter, it annualizes out to $2.7 billion, $2.8 billion, above the $2 billion that Jamie published in the letter. I know you don't want to extrapolate that.\n",
      "But can you remind us what sort of cost savings you still have in that, because this quarter did see expenses come down to $800 million down from $900 million? And then, secondly, is there an offset to that where the accretion becomes less and less and that's why you don't want to extrapolate the $2.7 billion, $2.8 billion? So, that's my first question.\n",
      "Jeremy Barnum (CFO): Okay. Thanks, Charlie. And I'm going to do my best to answer your question, while sticking to my sort of guns on not giving too much First Republic specific guidance. But I do think that the kind of framework you're articulating is broadly correct. So, let me go through the pieces.\n",
      "So yes, the current quarter's results annualized to more than the $2 billion Jamie talked about. Yes, a big part of that reason is discount accretion which was very frontloaded as a result of short-dated assets. So, that's part of the reason that you see that converge. Yes, it's also true that we expect the expense run rate to decline later in the year as we continue making progress on integration. Obviously, as I think as I mentioned to you last quarter, from a full year perspective you just have the offset of the full year calendarization effect.\n",
      "There's maybe an embedded question in there, too, about we had talked about $2.5 billion of integration expense. And the integration is real, the expenses are real, and also the time spent on that is quite real. It's a lot of work for a lot of people. It's going well, but we're not done yet; and it takes a lot of effort.\n",
      "But broadly, I think that our expectations for integration expense are probably coming in a bit lower than we originally assumed on the morning of the deal, for a couple of reasons. One is that the framework around the time was understandably quite conservative and sort of assumes that we would kind of lose a meaningful portion of the franchise, and would sort of need to size the expense base accordingly. And of course, it's worked out, to your point, quite a bit better than that. And therefore, the amount of expenses that is necessary to keep this bigger franchise is higher. And that means, less integration expense associated with taking down those numbers.\n",
      "It's probably also true that the integration assumptions were conservative. They were based on kind of more typical type of bank Mergers & Acquisitions assumptions as opposed to the particular nature of this deal including the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and so on and so forth. So, yeah, I think that probably is a pretty complete answer to your question. Thanks, Charlie.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 2, Justification: The CFO directly addresses both parts of the question by confirming that discount accretion was front-loaded and that expense run rates are expected to decline further. However, the answer avoids providing specific quantified details regarding the 'sort of cost savings' remaining or the magnitude of the expected future decline, which was implicitly requested by the analyst.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Mike Mayo (Analyst): Hi. Jeremy, you said it's too early to end the overearning narrative and you highlighted higher deposit costs and the impact of lower rates and lower Net Interest Income and Debt Capital Markets pull-forward and credit costs going higher. Anything I'm missing in that list? And what would cause you to end the overearning narrative?\n",
      "Jeremy Barnum (CFO): No. Actually, I think that is the right list, Mike. I mean, frankly, I think one thing that would end the overearning narrative is if our annual returns were closer to 17%. I mean, to the extent that that is the through the cycle number that we believe and that we're currently producing more than that, that's one very simple way to look at that.\n",
      "But the pieces of that are the pieces that you talked about and the single most important piece is the deposit margin. Our deposit margins are well above historical norms, and that is a big part of the reason that we still are emphasizing the overearning narrative.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 1, Justification: The CFO directly confirmed the analyst's list and explicitly stated that annual returns closer to 17% would end the \"overearning narrative.\" The response was clear, specific, and fully addressed both parts of the question.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Glenn Schorr (Analyst): Cool. Maybe one other follow-up. You're always investing. You clearly get paid in growth across the franchise as you do. But relative to a lot of other banks that have been keeping the expenses a lot closer to flat, do you envision environment, or maybe I should rephrase that, what type of environment would have J.P. Morgan pull back on this tremendous investment spending wave that you've been going through?\n",
      "Jeremy Barnum (CFO): Sure. So, I think the first thing to say which is somewhat obvious but I'm going to say it anyway is that, there are some like auto-governors in this, right? Like some portion of the expense base is directly related to revenue, whether it's volume-related commissions, whether it's incentive compensation, whether it's other things. So, there are some auto-correcting elements of the expense base that would happen automatically as part of the normal discipline. So, that's point one.\n",
      "Point two is that, independently of the environment, we are always looking for efficiencies. It's a little bit hard to see it, and in a world where we're guiding to, I guess, now with the special assessment added, $91 billion of expenses, it's hard to tell a story about all the efficiencies that have been generated underneath. But that is part of the DNA of the company, that does happen in BAU all the time as we grind things out, get the benefits of scale and try to extract that efficiency.\n",
      "And I think to get to the heart of your question which is, okay, in what type of an environment would we make different strategic questions? And in the end, I think that's a little bit about what that environment is really like. So, if you talk about like a normal recession, with visibility on the cycle, would we change our long-term strategic investment plans which are always built up from a financial modeling perspective assuming resilience through-the-cycle? No, we wouldn't.\n",
      "Could there be some environments that for whatever reason change the business case for certain investments, or even certain businesses, that lead us to make meaningfully different strategic choices? Yes, but that would be because the through-the-cycle analysis has changed for some reason. I just don't see us fundamentally making strategically different decisions if the strategic outlook is unchanged, simply because of the business cycle in the short-term.\n",
      "Glenn Schorr (Analyst): Awesome. Thank you.\n",
      "Jeremy Barnum (CFO): Thanks.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 3, Justification: The CFO directly states that a 'normal recession' would not lead to a pullback in investment spending, which directly answers part of the question. However, for environments that *would* cause a pullback, the answer becomes vague, referring to internal conditions like a change in the 'business case' or 'strategic outlook' rather than describing specific external 'types of environments' that would trigger such a shift.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Mike Mayo (Analyst): Hi. Jamie, I'm just trying to reconcile some of your concerns in your CEO letter. I'm sure the 60 pages – I can see you put a lot of effort into that, and it's appreciated. But you talked about scenarios, tail risk, macro risk, geopolitical risk and all that over several years, if not weeks or months. I get it. On the other hand, the firm is investing so much more outside the U.S., whether it's commercial or some digital banking, consumer or wholesale payments. So, I'm just trying to reconcile kind of your actions with your words.\n",
      "And specifically, how is global Wholesale Payments going? You mentioned you're in 60 countries. You do business a lot more. How is that business in particular doing? Thanks.\n",
      "Jeremy Barnum (CFO): Right, Mike. So I’m sorry to tell you that Jamie actually left us because he’s at a leadership off-site. That’s why he was here remote. So, I think he left the call in my hands, for better or for worse. But let me try to address some of your points and without sort of speaking for Jamie here.\n",
      "I think that when we talk about the impact of the geopolitical uncertainty on the outlook, part of the point there is to note that the U.S. is not isolated from that. If we have global macroeconomic problems as a result of geopolitical situations, that’s not only a problem outside of the U.S.; that affects the global economy and therefore the US and therefore our corporate customers, et cetera, et cetera.\n",
      "And in that context, keeping in mind what we always say that we invest through-the-cycle, that we sort of, we don’t go into countries and then leave countries, et cetera. Obviously, we adjust around the edges, we manage risks, we do make choices as a function of the overall geopolitical environment. But broadly, the notion that we would pull back meaningfully from one of the key competitive strengths that this company has always had which is, its sort of global character because of a particular moment geopolitically, would just be inconsistent with how we've always operated.\n",
      "And in terms of the Wholesale Payments business, it's going great. We're taking share. There's been a lot of innovation there, a lot of investment in technology, a lot of connectivity to payment systems in different countries around the world. And yeah, I'm sure we'll give you more color in other settings on that, but it's a good story. It's a nice thing to see.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 4, Justification: The CFO provided very general and positive statements about the global Wholesale Payments business (\"going great,\" \"taking share\") without offering any specific metrics or data to support these claims, thus avoiding the 'how is it doing' aspect of the question. The explicit statement 'I'm sure we'll give you more color in other settings on that' also served as a clear deferral of the specific details requested.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Mike Mayo (Analyst): Your 17% through the cycle ROTCE expectation, what is the Common Equity Tier 1 ratio that you assume for that?\n",
      "Jeremy Barnum (CFO): I mean, we would generally assume requirements plus a reasonable buffer, which, depending on the shape of rules, could be a little bit smaller or a little bit bigger and no small part is a function of the volatility of those rules, which goes back to my prior comments on SCB and Comprehensive Capital Analysis.\n",
      "But obviously, as you well know, what actually matters is less the ratio and more the dollars and at this point, the dollars are very much a function of where rules land and where the Risk-Weighted Assets lands and obviously, things like Global Systemically Important Banks recalibration and so on. So, we've done a bunch of scenario analysis along the lines of what I did at Investor Day that informs those numbers.\n",
      "But that is obviously one big element of uncertainty behind that 17%, which is why at Investor Day when we talked about it, both Daniel and I were quite specific about saying that we thought 17% was still achievable, assuming a reasonable outcome on the Basel III Endgame.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 4, Justification: The CFO avoids providing a specific Common Equity Tier 1 ratio as requested. Instead, he explains the complexities and uncertainties surrounding regulatory rules and risk-weighted assets, which prevent him from giving a direct number. He offers reasons for not disclosing the ratio rather than providing the requested assumption.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Saul Martinez (Analyst): Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Jeremy, can you give an update on the stress capital buffer? You noted obviously that you think there is an error in the Fed's calculation due to OCI. Can you just give us a sense of what the dialogue with the Fed looks like? Is there a process to modify the SCB higher and if you could give us a sense of what that process looks like?\n",
      "Jeremy Barnum (CFO): Yeah. So, I'm not going to comment about any conversations with the Fed – not to confirm or deny that they even exist. That stuff is private.\n",
      "And so, then if you talk about, like the timing here, right, so you know that the stress capital buffer that's been released at 3.3% is a preliminary number. By rule, the Fed has to release that by August 31. It may come sooner.\n",
      "You talked about an error in the calculation. We haven't used that word. What we know, what we believe rather is that the amount of OCI gain that came through the Fed's disclosed results looked non-intuitively high to us. And if you adjust that in ways that we think are reasonable, you would get a slightly higher stress capital buffer. Whether the Fed agrees and whether they decide to make that change or not is up to them, and we'll see what happens.\n",
      "I think the larger point is that if you look at the industry as a whole and if you sort of put us into that with some higher pro forma’d SCB, whatever it might suitably be, you actually see once again quite a bit of volatility in the year-on-year change in the stress capital buffer for many firms.\n",
      "And just sort of reiterating and another example of what we've said a lot over the years that it's volatile, it's untransparent, it makes it very hard to manage capital of a bank. It leads to excessively high management buffers, and we think it's really not a great way to do things. So, I'll leave it at that.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 4, Justification: The CFO explicitly stated they would not comment on conversations with the Fed, directly avoiding a key part of the question. While they clarified their stance on the OCI calculation, they did not describe the requested process for modifying the SCB. The response then broadened significantly to a general critique of the SCB framework, redirecting from the specific inquiry.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Gerard Cassidy (Analyst): Thank you. And I guess, as a tie-in to that question and answer, we've read and seen so much about the private credit growth in this country by private credit companies. Can you give us some color on what you're seeing there, both as a competitor, but also as a client of JPMorgan? How you balance the two out, where you may see them bidding on business that you'd like but at the same time you're supporting their business?\n",
      "Jeremy Barnum (CFO): Right. Yeah. I mean, I think that tension between us as a provider of secured financing to some portions of the private credit, private equity community, you're talking about different parts of the capital structure. But we do recognize that we compete in some areas and we are clients of each other in other areas, and that's part of the franchise and it's all good at some level.\n",
      "But narrowly, on private credit, it is interesting to observe what's going on there. So I would say, for us, the strategy there is very much to be product agnostic actually. It's not so much like, oh, is it private credit or is it syndicated lending? It's, what does it take to be good at this stuff? And what it takes is, stuff that we have and have always had and that we're very good at in each individual silo. So, you need underwriting skill, structuring skill, origination, distribution, secondary trading, risk appetite, credit analysis capabilities. And this is what we do and we're really good at it.\n",
      "And increasingly, what you see actually is that, as you see us doing a little bit, as the private credit space gets bigger, it starts to make sense to actually bring in some co-lenders so that you can sort of do big enough deals without having undue concentration risks. I mean, even if you have the capital, you just may not want the concentration risk.\n",
      "And so, in a funny way, the private credit space becomes a little bit more like the syndicated lending space. And at the same time, the syndicated lending space being influenced a little bit by these private credit unitranche structures, gets pushed a little bit in the private credit direction in terms of like speed of execution and other aspects of how that business works. So, we're watching it. The competitive dynamics are interesting. Certainly, there's some pressure in some areas. But we really do think that our overall value proposition and competitive position here is second to none, and so we're looking forward to the future here.\n",
      "Gerard Cassidy (Analyst): Appreciate the color. Thank you.\n",
      "Jeremy Barnum (CFO): Thanks, Gerard.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 4, Justification: The CFO acknowledges the tension between being a competitor and a client in the private credit space but provides a high-level, somewhat generic response focused on JPMorgan's established capabilities and 'product agnostic' approach. The answer largely avoids detailing specific strategies for *how* the firm balances this tension or navigates direct competitive bids from entities they also serve, instead relying on general strengths and market observations.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Steven Chubak (Analyst): No need to apologize, Jeremy. That was a really helpful perspective. Maybe just for my follow-up on Net Interest Income, you've been very consistent just in flagging the risk related to Net Interest Income overearning, especially in light of potential deposit attrition as well as repricing headwinds. In the second quarter, we did see at least some moderation in repricing pressures, deposit balances were also more resilient in with a seasonally weak quarter for deposit growth.\n",
      "So, just given the evidence that some deposit pressures appear to be abating, do you see the potential for Net Interest Income normalizing higher? And where do you think that level could ultimately be in terms of stabilization?\n",
      "Jeremy Barnum (CFO): Yeah. Interesting question, Steve. So, let's talk about deposit balances. So, yeah, I see your point about how balance pressures are slightly abating. When you look at the system as a whole, just to go through it, QT is still a bit of a headwind, loan growth is modest and not enough to offset that.\n",
      "And our PE seems to have settled in roughly at its current levels, and there are reasons to believe that it might not go down that much more, although that could always change and that could supply extra reserves into the system. But on balance net across all those various effects, we still think that there are net headwinds to deposit balances.\n",
      "So, when we think of our balance outlook, we see it as flat to slightly down maybe with our sort of market share and growth ambitions offsetting those system-wide headwinds.\n",
      "So, in terms of normalizing higher, I guess it depends on relative to what, but I think it's definitely too early to be sort of calling the end of the overearning narrative or the normalization narrative.\n",
      "Clearly, the main difference in our current guidance relative to what we had earlier in the year, which implied a lot more sequential decline, is just the change in the Fed outlook. So, two cuts versus six cuts is the main difference there.\n",
      "But obviously, based on the latest inflation data and so on, you could easily get back to a situation with a lot more cuts in the yield curve. So, we'll see how it goes and in the end, we're kind of focused on, on just running the place, recognizing, and trying not to be distracted by what remains some amount of overearning, whatever it is.\n",
      "Steven Chubak (Analyst): Understood, Jeremy. Thanks so much for taking my questions.\n",
      "Jeremy Barnum (CFO): Thanks, Steve.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 3, Justification: The CFO directly addresses the potential for NII normalizing higher by stating it's \"definitely too early\" to call the end of the overearning narrative, which answers the first part of the question directly. However, the CFO completely avoids providing any specific level or range for NII stabilization, instead shifting the discussion to system-wide deposit headwinds and the impact of the Fed outlook on their guidance, thereby only partially addressing the full scope of the question.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Matt O'Connor (Analyst): Yeah, that was a really helpful chart. Just the one follow-up, on the yield curve effects, I guess, what do you mean by that because right now the yield curve is inverted, maybe you're still breathing in the impact of that. But kind of longer term, you'd expect little bit of steepness of the curve, which I would think would help. But what did you mean by that? Thank you.\n",
      "Jeremy Barnum (CFO): Yeah. I mean, you and I have talked about this before, I guess. I sort of – I guess, I don't really agree fundamentally with the notion that the way to think about things is that sort of yield curve steepness above and beyond what's priced in by the forewords is a source of structural Net Interest Income or Net Interest Margin for banks, if you know what I mean.\n",
      "Like, I mean, people have different views about the so-called term premium and obviously, in a moment of inverted curve and different types of treasury supply dynamics, people's thinking on that may be changing.\n",
      "But I think we saw when rates were at zero and the 10-year note was below 2%, everyone sort of – many people were kind of tempted to try to get extra Net Interest Margin, extra Net Interest Income by extending duration a lot. But when the steepness of the curve implies, it is driven by the expectation of actually aggressive Fed tightening, it's just a timing issue and you can wind up kind of pretty offsides from a capital and other perspectives, so.\n",
      "There're some interesting questions about whether fiscal dynamics might result in a structurally steeper yield curve down the road and whether that could be sort of earning the term premium, so to speak, could be a source of Net Interest Income. But that feels a bit speculative to me at this point.\n",
      "Matt O'Connor (Analyst): Got it. Okay. Thank you for the details.\n",
      "Jeremy Barnum (CFO): Thanks, Matt.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 4, Justification: The CFO's response avoids directly clarifying what 'yield curve effects' specifically meant in the context of their provided chart. Instead, the answer pivots to a broader, more philosophical discussion about the general challenges of benefiting from yield curve steepness and the speculative nature of such impacts on Net Interest Income, without explaining their own underlying assumptions or calculations.\n",

      "Charles W. Peabody (Analyst): As a quick follow-up. Where are the next homeruns going to come from? And this is more strategic beyond just JPMorgan, but there are probably going to be more regional bank failures, whether it's this year or next year, and opportunities to pick those up. But what you're seeing is that, private equity and family offices are setting up to participate in this next round of bank failures. Mnuchin's buying of NYCB is clearly to create a platform for rollups of failed banks, and then there are other family offices that have filed shelf registrations for bank holding companies whose specific purpose is to buy failed banks.\n",
      "So, do you think that these opportunities are going to be competed away by private credit? And as part of that, do you think the regulators are going to view private credit as a different party and less attractive party versus bank takeovers of failed banks? So, that's my question.\n",
      "Jeremy Barnum (CFO): Right. Okay, Charlie. There's a lot in there. And to be honest, I just don't love the idea of spending a lot of time on this call speculating about bank failures. You obviously have a particular view about the next wave in the landscape. I'm not going to bother debating that with you. But I guess, let me just try to say a couple of things, doing my best to answer your question.\n",
      "As we talked about earlier, we have a lot of capital. And as Jamie says, the capital is earnings in store, and right now we don't see a lot of really compelling opportunities to deploy the capital. But if opportunities arise despite the uncertainty about the Basel III Endgame, we will be well positioned to deploy it. I think embedded there is also sort of a question about the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation's attitude towards different types of bidders, and obviously there's a lot of thinking and analysis happening about the entire process and some recent forums and speeches on bank resolution and so on and so forth.\n",
      "And I think probably we can all agree that it's better, all else equal for the system, to have as much capital available and as many different types of capital available to ensure that things are stabilized if anything ever goes wrong. But the mechanics of how you do that when you're talking about banks are not trivial and not to be underestimated. So I guess, that's probably as much as I have on that.\n",
      "Charles W. Peabody (Analyst): Alright. Thank you.\n",
      "Jeremy Barnum (CFO): Thanks.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 4, Justification: The CFO explicitly states he does not want to speculate on bank failures, which is central to the analyst's query about future \"homeruns.\" While acknowledging the question about regulators and private credit, he provides only generic statements about capital availability and ongoing discussions without offering specific insight into competitive dynamics or regulatory preferences. The response largely avoids directly addressing the core questions posed by the analyst.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Saul Martinez (Analyst): Okay, got it. That's helpful. Just following up on capital returns on Steve's question, I think you highlighted in response it's a matter of when, not if, and obviously, Jamie’s not there, you can’t speak for Jamie, but seems to have shown limited enthusiasm for a special dividend or buybacks at current valuations. Can you just give us a sense of how you’re thinking about the various options? Any updated thoughts on a special dividend?\n",
      "And can you do other things like, for example, have a material increase in your dividend payout, sort of a step function increase, where keep that flat and grow into that, grow your earnings into that over time? Can you just maybe give us a sense of how you're thinking about what options you have available to deploy that capital?\n",
      "Jeremy Barnum (CFO): Sure. Yeah. I mean, I would direct you to read, I'm sure you have, Jamie's comments at the industry conference, where he participated the week after Investor Day because he went into just good amount of detail on this stuff, addressing some of these points.\n",
      "And I think this comment there about the special dividend was that it's not really our preference. We hear from people that many of our investors wouldn't find that particularly appealing, and he said as much that it wouldn't be sort of our first choice.\n",
      "So, I think the larger point is just that, a little bit to your question, there are a number of tools in the toolkit and they're really the same tools that are part of our capital hierarchy. So, first and foremost, we're looking to deploy the capital into organic or inorganic growth.\n",
      "And then, the dividend, I think we're always going to want to keep it in that sort of, like sustainable and also sustainable in a stressed environment so that continues to be the way we think about that.\n",
      "And then, at the end of it, it's buybacks and Jamie's been on the record for over a decade, I think, over many shareholder letters, talking about how he thinks about price and buybacks and valuation and price is a factor. So, that's sort of the totality of the set of options, I guess.\n",
      "Saul Martinez (Analyst): Okay, great. Thanks a lot.\n",
      "Jeremy Barnum (CFO): Thanks, Saul.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 4, Justification: The CFO initially redirects the analyst to previously published comments by the CEO, which is a clear evasive tactic. While the answer reiterates general stances on capital allocation and special dividends, it avoids directly addressing the specific question about a 'material increase' or 'step function increase' in the regular dividend payout, instead offering a general statement about sustainability.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Gerard Cassidy (Analyst): Very good. And as a follow-up, you've been very clear about the Consumer Credit Card charge-offs and delinquency levels, and we all know about the Commercial Real Estate Office. And you always talk about overearning on net interest income, of course. One of the great credit quality stories for everyone, including yourselves, is the C&I portfolio, how strong it's been in this elevated rate environment?\n",
      "And I know your numbers are still quite low, but in the Corporate and Investment Bank, you had about a $500 million pickup in non-accrual loans. Can you share with us what are you seeing in C&I? Are there any early signs of cracks or anything? And, again, I know your numbers are still good, but I'm just trying to look forward to see if there's something here over the next 12 months or so.\n",
      "Jeremy Barnum (CFO): Yeah. It's a good question. I think the short answer is no. We're not really seeing early signs of cracks in C&I. I mean, yes, I agree with you, like the C&I charge-off rate has been very, very low for a long time. I think we emphasized that at last year's Investor Day, if I remember correctly. I think the C&I charge-off rate we've seen in 10 years was something like literally zero.\n",
      "So, that is clearly very low by historical standards. And while we take a lot of pride in that number and I think it reflects the discipline in our underwriting process and the strength of our credit culture across the bankers and the risk team, that's not – we don't actually run that franchise to like a zero loss expectation.\n",
      "So, you have to assume there will be some upward pressure on that. But in any given quarter, the C&I numbers tend to be quite lumpy and quite idiosyncratic. So, I don't think that anything in the current quarter's results is indicative of anything broader, and I haven't heard anyone internally talk that way, I would say.\n",
      "Gerard Cassidy (Analyst): Great. Appreciate the insights as always. Thank you.\n",
      "Jeremy Barnum (CFO): Thanks, Gerard.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 1, Justification: The CFO directly answers the question about 'early signs of cracks' in C&I by stating 'no' at the outset. They acknowledge the lumpiness and idiosyncratic nature of C&I numbers, implicitly explaining the non-accrual loan pickup as not indicative of a broader negative trend. The response directly addresses the analyst's forward-looking concern about the next 12 months.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Erika Najarian (Analyst): Hi, good morning. I just had one clean-up question, Jeremy. The consensus provision for 2024 is $10.7 billion. Could you maybe clarify for once and for all sort of Jamie's comments at an industry conference earlier and try to sort of triangulate if that $10.7 billion provision is appropriate for the growth level that you are planning for in Card?\n",
      "Jeremy Barnum (CFO): Yeah. Happy to clarify that. So, Jamie's comments were that the allowance – the build and the Card allowance, so we're talking about Card specifically, we expected something like $2 billion for the full year. As I sit here today, our expectation for that number is actually slightly higher, but it's in the ballpark.\n",
      "And I think in terms of what that means for the consensus on the overall allowance change for the year, last time I checked, it still looked a little low on that front. So, who knows what it'll actually wind up being, but that remains our view.\n",
      "One question that we've gotten is how to reconcile that build to the 12% growth in OS that we've talked about because it seems like a little bit high relative to what you would have otherwise assumed if you apply some sort of a standard coverage ratio to that growth. But the reason that's the case is essentially a combination of higher revolving mix, as we continue to see some normalization revolve in that 12%, as well as seasoning of earlier vintages, which comes with slightly higher allowance per unit of OS growth.\n",
      "Erika Najarian (Analyst): Great. Thank you.\n",
      "Jeremy Barnum (CFO): Thanks, Erika.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 1, Justification: The CFO directly clarifies Jamie's comments regarding the Card allowance build and provides an updated estimate. They also address the $10.7 billion consensus provision, stating it appeared 'a little low,' and thoroughly explain the factors (higher revolving mix, seasoning of vintages) driving their allowance build relative to Card growth.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Glenn Schorr (Analyst): Hi, thanks very much. So, Jeremy, the discussions so far around private credit and you all, your recent comments have been the ability to add on balance sheet and compete when you need to compete on the private credit front. And I do think that most of the discussion has been about the direct lending component. So, I'm curious if you're showing more progress and activity on that front. And then, very importantly, do you see the same trend happening on the asset-backed finance side because that's a bigger part of the world and it's a bigger part of your business? So, I'd appreciate your thoughts there. Thanks.\n",
      "Jeremy Barnum (CFO): Yeah. Thanks, Glenn. So, on private credit, so nothing really new to say there. I think, I guess, one way the environment's evolving a little bit is, as you know, a lot of money has been raised in private credit funds looking for deals. And sort of a little bit to my prior comment, in a relatively muted acquisition finance environment, at this point you've got a lot of money chasing, like not that many deals. So, the space is a little bit quieter than it was at the margin.\n",
      "Another interesting thing to note is some of this discussion about kind of lender protections that were typical in the syndicated leveraged finance market making their way into the private market as well as sort of people realize that even in the private market you probably need some of those protections in some cases, which is sort of supportive of the theme that we've been talking about, about convergence between the direct lending space and the syndicated lending space, which is kind of our core thesis here, which is that we can offer best-in-class service across the entire continuum, including secondary market trading and so on.\n",
      "So, we feel optimistic about our offering there. I think the current environment is maybe a little bit quieter than it was. So, it's maybe not a great moment to, like kind of test whether we're doing a lot more or less in the space, so to speak.\n",
      "And then, on asset-backed financing, you actually asked me that question before, and at the time, my answer was that I hadn't heard much about that trend and that continues to be the case. But clearly, there must be something I'm missing. So, I can follow up on that and maybe we can have a chat about it.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 3, Justification: The CFO directly answered the question regarding the trend in asset-backed finance. However, for the primary question about the firm's \"progress and activity\" in direct lending, he provided general comments on the market environment and the firm's strategic approach rather than specific updates on their operational progress, explicitly stating it's \"not a great moment to... test whether we're doing a lot more or less.\" This makes the overall response only partially address the questions.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Mike Mayo (Analyst): Let me just zoom out for one more question on the return target. I mean, when I asked Jamie at the 2013 Investor Day, would it make sense to have 13.5% capital, he was basically telling me to take a hike, right? And now, you have 15.3% capital and you're saying, well, we might want to have a lot more capital here.\n",
      "I mean, at some point, if you're spending $17 billion a year to improve the company, if you're gaining share with digital banking, if you're automating the back office, if you're moving ahead with Artificial Intelligence, if you're doing all these things that I think you say others aren't doing, why wouldn't those returns go higher over time or do you just assume you'll be competing those benefits away? Thanks.\n",
      "Jeremy Barnum (CFO): Yeah. I mean, I think in short, Mike, and we've talked about this a lot and Jamie's talked about this a lot, it's a very, very, very competitive market, and we're very happy with our performance. We're very happy with the share we've taken, and 17% is like an amazing number actually.\n",
      "And like, to be able to do that, given how robust the competition is from banks, from non-banks, from U.S. banks, from foreign banks, and all of the different businesses that we compete in, is something that we're really proud of. So, the number has a range around it, obviously. So, it's not a promise, it's not a guarantee, and it can fluctuate.\n",
      "But we're very proud to be in the ballpark of being able to think that we can deliver it, again, assuming a reasonable outcome on Basel III Endgame. But it's a very, very, very competitive market across all of our products and services and regions and client segments.\n",
      "Mike Mayo (Analyst): All right. Thank you.\n",
      "Betsy L. Graseck (Analyst): Hi, Jeremy. Hi, Jeremy.\n",
      "Jeremy Barnum (CFO): Hi, Betsy.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 4, Justification: The CFO avoids directly addressing why returns would not go higher over time, despite the analyst's points about significant investments and competitive advantages. Instead, the response emphasizes the highly competitive market as a justification for being \"very happy\" with the current 17% return target. This deflects from the core question about why returns aren't expected to increase beyond this point.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Gerard Cassidy (Analyst): Jeremy, I know you touched on deposits earlier in the call in response to a question. I noticed on the average balances the non-interest-bearing deposits were relatively stable quarter-to-quarter versus prior quarters when they’ve steadily declined. And this is one of the areas, of course, investors are focused on in terms of the future of the net interest margin for you and your peers. Can you elaborate, if you can, what you’re seeing in that non-interest-bearing deposit account? I know this is average and not period, and the end number may actually be lower. But what are you guys seeing here?\n",
      "Jeremy Barnum (CFO): Yeah. Good question, Gerard. I have to be honest, I hadn’t focused on that particular sequential explain, i.e., quarter-on-quarter change and average non-interest-bearing deposits.\n",
      "But I think the more important question is the big picture question, which is what do we expect? How are we thinking about ongoing migration of non-interest-bearing into interest-bearing in the current environment and how that affects our Net Interest Income outlook and our expectation for weighted average rate paid on deposits?\n",
      "And the answer to that question is that, we do continue to expect that migration to happen. So, if you think about it, in the Wholesale space, you have a bunch of clients with some balances and non-interest-bearing accounts, and over time for a variety of reasons, we do see them moving those balances into interest-bearing.\n",
      "So, we do continue to expect that migration to happen and therefore, that will be a source of headwinds. And that migration sometimes happens internally, i.e., out of non-interest-bearing into interest-bearing or into CDs. Sometimes, it goes into money markets or into investments, which is what we see happening in our Wealth Management business and some of it does leave the company.\n",
      "But one of the things that we're encouraged by is the extent to which we are actually capturing a large portion of that yield-seeking flow through CDs and money market offerings, et cetera, across our various franchises.\n",
      "So, big picture. I do think that migration out of non-interest-bearing into interest-bearing will continue to be a thing and that is a contributor to the modest headwinds that we expect for Net Interest Income right now. But, yeah, I'll leave it at that, I guess.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 4, Justification: The CFO explicitly states he had not focused on the specific quarter-on-quarter change in non-interest-bearing deposits that the analyst observed. He then immediately pivots from the analyst's specific question about the *reason for stability in the last quarter* to a broader discussion about the *ongoing migration* of deposits, thereby avoiding a direct explanation for the observed stability.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Steven Chubak (Analyst): So, wanted to start off with a question on capital just given some indications that the Fed is considering favorable revisions to both Basel III Endgame and the Global Systemically Important Banks surcharge calculations, which I know you've been pushing for some time. As you evaluate just different capital scenarios, are these revisions material enough where they could support a higher normalized ROTCE at the Firm versus the 17% target? And if so, just how that might impact or inform your appetite for buybacks going forward?\n",
      "Jeremy Barnum (CFO): Right. Okay. Thanks, Steve. And actually, before answering the question, I just want to remind everyone that Jamie is not able to join because he has a travel conflict overseas, so it's just going to be me today.\n",
      "Okay. Good question on the capital and the ROTCE. So, let me start with the ROTCE point first. In short, my answer to that question would be no. It's hard to imagine a scenario coming out of the whole potential range of outcomes on capital that involves an upward revision on ROTCE.\n",
      "If you think about the way we've been talking about this, we've said that before the Basel III Endgame proposal, we had a 17% through the cycle target, and that while you can imagine a range of different outcomes, the vast majority of them involve expansions of the denominator. And while we had ideas about changing the perimeter and repricing, all of which are still sort of in effect, most of those would be thought of as mitigants rather than things that would actually, like increase the ROTCE. And I don't really think that answer has particularly changed.\n",
      "So, as of now, that's what I would say, which is a good pivot to the next point, which is, yeah, we've been reading the same press coverage you've been reading and it's fun and interesting to speculate about the potential outcomes here. But in reality, we don't know anything you don't know. We don't know how reliable the press coverage is.\n",
      "And so, in that sense, I feel like on the overall capital return and buyback trajectory, not much has actually changed relative to what I laid out at Investor Day, the comments that I made then, the comments that Jamie made then, as well as the comments that Jamie made the subsequent week at an industry conference.\n",
      "So, maybe I'll just briefly summarize for everyone's benefit what we think that is, which is, one, we do recognize that our current practice on capital return and buybacks does lead to an ever-expanding Common Equity Tier 1 ratio. But obviously, we're going to run the company over the cycle over time at a reasonable Common Equity Tier 1 ratio with reasonable buffers relative to our requirement. So, after all the uncertainty is sorted out, the question of the deployment of the capital, one way or another, is a matter of when, not if.\n",
      "On the capital hierarchy, it's also worth noting that's another thing that remains unchanged, so I'll review it quickly. Growing the business organically and inorganically, sustainable dividend, and in that context it's worth noting that the board's announced intention to increase it to $1.25 is a 19% increase prior to last year. So, that's a testament to our performance and that is a return of capital.\n",
      "And then, finally buybacks. But that hierarchy does not commit us to return 100% of the capital generation in any given quarter. And so, as we sit here today, when you look at the relationship between the opportunity cost of not deploying the capital and the opportunities to deploy the capital outside the Firm, it's kind of hard to imagine an environment where that relationship argues more strongly for patience.\n",
      "So, given all that, putting it all together, and sorry for the long answer, we remain comfortable with the current amount of excess capital. And as Jamie has said, we really continue to think about it as earnings in store as much as anything else.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 2, Justification: The CFO directly answers the first part of the question regarding ROTCE, stating it's unlikely to increase. For the second part about buybacks, they clarify that not much has changed relative to previous communications due to ongoing regulatory uncertainty, but reiterate their long-term commitment to capital deployment, including buybacks, when conditions allow. The answer acknowledges the question and provides the existing framework and current limitations, rather than fully avoiding it.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Jim Mitchell (Analyst): Hey, good morning. So, Jeremy, as you highlighted, full year Net Interest Income guidance implies a sizable drop in Q4 Net Interest Income ex. Markets about 6%. So, can you just maybe discuss what are the largest drivers of the sequential decline including any initial thoughts on deposit behavior and pricing since the 50 basis point cut?\n",
      "And since it's related, I'll just throw out my follow-up question. I realize the forward curve is moving around a lot, but since Dan brought it up a month ago, can you frame how you're thinking about the Net Interest Income trajectory for 2025? Thanks.\n",
      "Jeremy Barnum (CFO): Yeah. Sure, Jim. I'll try to answer both questions together to the best of my ability. So, as we sit here today, the biggest single driver of the sequential decline is, in fact – that we're expecting – is, in fact, the yield curve. So, that yield curve has changed a little bit since Daniel made his comments at the conference earlier in the quarter, but not that significantly.\n",
      "In terms of deposit balances, which is obviously another important factor here in light of the Fed starting the cutting cycle, it feels to us like right now, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks for Consumer, we're pretty much in the trough right now as we speak.\n",
      "When you look at yield-seeking behavior that has come down quite a bit, so that's no longer as much of a headwind all else being equal. And then if you look at checking account balances, those have been pretty stable for some time, which we see as an indication that consumers are kind of done spending down their cash buffers. So that's kind of supportive for consumer deposit balances.\n",
      "And in that context, the other relevant point is the CD mix where, with the rate cuts coming, we expect CD balances to price down with pretty high betas and probably the CD mix actually peaking around now.\n",
      "And then as we move to Wholesale, we've actually already been seeing a little bit of growth there, and when you combine that with the sort of increasing view that many people in the market have that it's likely that the end of QT will be announced sometime soon, that's also a little bit supportive for deposit balances.\n",
      "So, maybe, I'll – well, I guess then you also asked me a little bit about next year. So, I guess one thing to say, right, is that we did have a sequential increase in Net Interest Income this quarter and, as you may recall, at Investor Day, I said that there was some chance that we would see sequential increases followed by sequential declines and that people should avoid kind of drawing the conclusion that we'd hit the trough when that happens. So that's essentially exactly what we're seeing now.\n",
      "But from where we sit now, given the yield curve, assuming the yield curve materializes obviously, we do see a pretty clear picture of sequential declines in Net Interest Income ex. Markets, but the trough may be happening sometime in the middle of next year, at which point the combination of balances, Card revolve growth and other factors can return us to sequential growth, obviously.\n",
      "We're guessing it's pretty far out in the future, and we'll give you formal guidance on all this stuff next quarter, but I think that gives you a better framework to work with.\n",
      "Jim Mitchell (Analyst): All right. Thanks a lot.\n",
      "Jeremy Barnum (CFO): Thanks.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 1, Justification: The CFO directly and comprehensively addresses both parts of the analyst's question. He identifies the yield curve as the largest driver for the sequential NII decline and provides detailed insights into various aspects of deposit behavior and pricing. For the 2025 NII trajectory, he clearly frames their current thinking, including the expectation of declines, a potential trough, and a return to sequential growth.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Betsy L. Graseck (Analyst): So, I did want to ask one drill-down question on 2Q, and it's related to the dollar amount of buybacks that you did do. I think in the press release, right, in the slide deck, it's $4.9 billion common stock net repurchases. So, the question here is, what's the governor for you on how much to do every quarter?\n",
      "And, I mean, I understand it's a function of, okay, how much do we organically grow. But even with that, so you get the organic growth, which you had some nice movement there. But you do the organic growth and then is it how much do we earn and we want to buy back our earnings or how should we be thinking about what that repurchase volume should be looking like over time?\n",
      "And I remember over at Investor Day the whole debate around I don't want to buy back my stock, but we are, right? So, I get this question from investors quite a bit of how should we be thinking about how you think about what the right amount is to be doing here.\n",
      "Jeremy Barnum (CFO): Yeah. That's a very good and fair question, Betsy. So, let me try to unpack it to the best of my ability. So, in no particular order, one thing that we've really tried to emphasize in a number of different settings, including in our recent 10-Qs actually is that we don't want to get into the business of guiding on buybacks.\n",
      "So, we're going to buy back whatever we think makes sense in the current moment sort of and we reserve the right to sort of change that at any time. So, I recognize that not everyone loves that, but that is kind of a philosophical belief and so, I might as well say it explicitly. It was pretty clear in the Q also, but I'm just going to say that again. So, that's point one.\n",
      "But having said that, let me nonetheless try to address your point on framework and governors. So, generally speaking, we think it doesn't make sense to sort of exit the market entirely unless the conditions are much more unusual than they are right now, let's say.\n",
      "Obviously, when for whatever reason, if we ever need to build capital in a hurry, we've done it before and we're always comfortable suspending buybacks entirely. But I think some modest amount of buybacks is a reasonable thing to do when you're generating your kind of capital.\n",
      "And so, we were talking before about this $2 billion pace. We're kind of trying to move away from this notion of a pace, but that's where that idea comes from, let's put it that way.\n",
      "You talked about the $4.9 billion, which I recognize may seem like a little bit of a random number. But where that actually comes from is the other statement that we've made that we have these significant item gains from Visa.\n",
      "And if you think about what that means, it means that we have, post the acceptance of the exchange offer, a meaningful long position and a liquid large cap financial stock, i.e., Visa, which realistically is highly correlated to our own stock. And so, in some sense, why carry that instead of just buying back JPMorgan stock.\n",
      "So, we talked about – Jamie talked about, as we liquidate the Visa, deploying those proceeds into JPM and that’s what we did this quarter. So, that is why the $4.9 billion is a little higher, and it’s consistent with my comments at Investor Day around having slightly increased the amount of buybacks.\n",
      "And beyond that, what you’re left with is my answer to Steve’s question, which is that, to your point about buying back earnings or whatever, when we’re generating these types of earnings and there’s this much organic capital being generated in the absence of opportunities to deploy it organically or inorganically and while continuing to maintain our healthy, but sustainable dividend, if we don’t return the capital we are going to keep growing the Common Equity Tier 1 ratio to levels, which, if you think about the long strategic outlook of the company, are not reasonable.\n",
      "They’re just artificially high and unnecessary. So, one way or the other, that will need to be addressed at some point. It’s just that we don’t feel that now is the right time.\n",
      "Betsy L. Graseck (Analyst): All right. Thank you, Jeremy. Appreciate it.\n",
      "Jeremy Barnum (CFO): Thanks, Betsy.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 2, Justification: The CFO directly states that the company does not provide specific guidance on buybacks, which is a clear answer to the quantitative aspect of the question. However, he then provides a detailed explanation of the qualitative factors and philosophy that govern buyback decisions, such as managing excess capital and the CET1 ratio, and specifically addresses the reason for the $4.9 billion buyback. This comprehensive explanation addresses the spirit of the analyst's question about how they think about the right amount, despite not giving a precise forward-looking number.\n",

      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Gerard Cassidy (Analyst): Hi, Jeremy. How are you?\n",
      "Jeremy Barnum (CFO): Hi, Gerard.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 5, Justification: The CFO did not answer the analyst's direct question, 'How are you?'. Instead, they provided a simple greeting. This response completely avoided the personal inquiry and offered no relevant information regarding their well-being, clearly changing the topic.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Betsy L. Graseck (Analyst): Can you hear me okay?\n",
      "Jeremy Barnum (CFO): Yeah. We can hear you. Can you hear us?\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 1, Justification: The exchange is a technical audio check. The CFO's response directly and clearly confirms they can hear the analyst and asks a reciprocal question, fully addressing the audio check inquiry without any vagueness or redirection.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Betsy L. Graseck (Analyst): And so Daniel's comments in September were on Net Interest Income in total or Net Interest Income ex. Markets? Could you just clarify that?\n",
      "Jeremy Barnum (CFO): No. Those were core Net Interest Income or Net Interest Income ex.. So again, reiterating at the time, the 2024 consensus was $91.5 billion. The 2025 consensus was $90 billion on Net Interest Income ex. and our point was that that number, which remains an asset-sensitive number, indicated an insufficient amount of sequential decline year-on-year. The current consensus as we see it for Net Interest Income ex. Markets is $87 billion. And as we've noted, that's closer albeit maybe still a little bit toppy.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 1, Justification: The CFO directly answers the question by clarifying that Daniel's comments referred to 'Net Interest Income ex. Markets.' The response is precise and fully addresses the specific inquiry without any ambiguity or deflection.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Gerard Cassidy (Analyst): Very good. And then as a follow-up, in view of this excess capital and your comments a moment ago about direct lending, you look at your current cash and marketable securities on a risk-weighted asset basis, you put it in your presentation of course, $1.5 trillion. Average loans is $1.3 trillion. When the dust settles, you know what your capital requirements are. Can you frame out for us, levering up the excess capital with more loans, is that a path that might be considered over the next two or three years relative to where you are on a mix basis? I know you're going to grow your loans, but I'm talking about the mix.\n",
      "Jamie Dimon (CEO): Absolutely, positively not. Loans are an outcome of doing good business. We want to do good business. If it grows our balance sheet, we're fine.\n",
      "Jeremy Barnum (CFO): And I do think, Gerard, it depends a lot on what type of loans you're talking about, right? So I think in the end, as Jamie says, like it's capital. We're going to deploy it ideally to grow the franchise organically, and that could include loans that are almost good loans on a stand-alone basis, as well as loans that are part of an overall relationship, what we're getting other revenue as part of that. So it's the same strategy that we've always had, but I wouldn't think of it as like excess capital to be deployed against a particular product. I would think of it as it's there for a rainy day. Let's hope the environment doesn't deteriorate a lot, but if it does, we'll be ready. And there will be opportunities hopefully to deploy it against a client franchise or against a stock. And if not, we'll return it. But not now.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 1, Justification: The answer is very direct. Jamie Dimon explicitly states \"Absolutely, positively not\" regarding the strategy of leveraging excess capital with more loans to change the mix. Jeremy Barnum further clarifies that excess capital is for overall organic growth or acting as a buffer, not to be deployed against a specific product like loans to alter the mix.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Glenn Schorr (Analyst): Hi. Thanks very much. And so glad Jamie didn't say what he was about to say because that's the answer to this question.\n",
      "So we've seen a couple more banks entering partnerships with alternative managers. We've seen limited loan growth for a few years now, market-related also; limited flows into fixed income funds, yet plenty of growth in private credit in general. And you're one of the best asset managers on the planet, but in my view, less dominant in all things private credit.\n",
      "So maybe you could talk about what things you're working on and why that's too narrow of a view of your ability to serve all parts of clients’ lending needs, not just the public markets and public lending side. Thanks.\n",
      "Jamie Dimon (CEO): Yeah. So let me take time to cover this one, because obviously it has become very important. People talking about how they're growing and partnering and things like that.\n",
      "And so first and foremost – I’m going to talk about very strategic and then very tactical, I think they're both important. First and foremost, we are here to give our clients an agnostic view of the world and what the best product and services are for them. Therefore, when a client comes in, we will offer them both direct lending, ourselves, and syndicated lending or other specialized kind of lending. And they all have pluses and minuses.\n",
      "Direct lending could be done faster, maybe simpler covenants, unitranche. It is more expensive and you're just seeing a little things go back and forth between syndicated lending and direct lending. But we're going to offer the clients basically what's in their best interest and tell them what those products are across the venue.\n",
      "We mentioned before in the past that we allocated $10 billion of capital to make direct loans. We've actually deployed a lot of capital. Some of those have already been paid off, some of it’s done. So we are going to do it directly and we are going to – $10 billion could be $20 billion or $30 billion, not limiting it today. I will say today, we're extending. We will do $500 million, we will do $1 billion, we will do more than $1 billion, we'll do it sole-handed or we'll do it with partners.\n",
      "Very importantly, we are not going to allocate ourselves to one partner. So we have – I think we've announced a bunch of co-lenders, but that just creates more flexibility and more size. We're not going to use that flexibility to slow it down and have to get permission from everybody, because like I said, JPMorgan could underwrite it and own it like a bridge loan and syndicate it after the fact. And we're going to use our own risk measures and stuff like that, again, all in the service of the client and making sure we're offering them the best thing.\n",
      "And we're going with different strategies. We're not going to tie ourselves exclusively to one capital provider. I think that would limit what we could offer our clients, it probably would be more price competitive. We could do some of this very specific thing and not the solution that this is the third-party capital provider. That's our strategy. We're going to be there, we're going to do it, and we're going to do it in spite of the fact there's capital arbitrage taking place.\n",
      "So if you look at the arbitrage today, where a bank has to hold for things, where insurance could, they are dramatically different. That's a disadvantage, but we've had those disadvantages in other businesses for a long time. We are going to do what's right for the client. Remember, when we do business with a client, we also get other revenues off of them. So it isn't just the loan; we look at the whole relationship. So we're quite comfortable we can compete. I just announced much bigger lending platforms and sizes and stuff like that, so I hope if any of the press is on they heard this too.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 1, Justification: The answer is very direct and thoroughly addresses the analyst's question. Jamie Dimon directly refutes the premise of JPMorgan being 'less dominant' in private credit by detailing their significant capital allocation ($10B with potential for more), their strategy for direct lending and partnerships, and how they serve all client lending needs beyond public markets.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Matt O'Connor (Analyst): And then specifically in the debit and credit card spend that you guys break out, you had nice growth year-over-year, up 6%, flat quarter-over-quarter, I know there's a lot of seasonality 2Q to 3Q. I think last year, it was up about 1%. But are you seeing any kind of changes in the consumer spend either the mix or some signs of a slowdown later in the quarter? Thank you.\n",
      "Jeremy Barnum (CFO): So I think what there is to say about consumer spend is a little bit boring in a sense because what's happened is that it's become normal, so meaning – I mean, I think we're getting to the point where it no longer makes sense to talk about the pandemic, but maybe one last time. One of the things that you had was that heavy rotation into T&E as people did a lot of traveling and they booked cruises that they hadn't done before, and everyone was going out to dinner a lot, whatever. So you had the big spike in T&E, the big rotation into discretionary spending, and that's now normalized. And you would normally think that rotation out of discretionary into nondiscretionary would be a sign of consumers battening down the hatches and getting ready for a much worse environment. But given the levels that it started from, what we see it as is actually like normalization. And inside that data, we're not seeing weakening, for example, in retail spending.\n",
      "So overall, we see the spending patterns as being sort of solid and consistent with the narrative that the consumer is on solid footing and consistent with the strong labor market and the current central case of a kind of no-landing scenario economically. But obviously, as we always point out, that's one scenario and there are many other scenarios.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 2, Justification: The CFO directly addresses the core concern about a slowdown by stating they are 'not seeing weakening' in consumer spending and that patterns are 'solid.' While the answer provides context about the normalization of spending, it could have been more specific about current 'mix' changes or detailed observations for the 'later in the quarter' period beyond general statements.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Glenn Schorr (Analyst): All right. Thanks for all that.\n",
      "Gerard Cassidy (Analyst): Good morning, Jeremy, and good morning, Jamie. Jeremy, when you guys look at your current capital ratios, they are obviously very healthy. Can you guys give us some color on the new Basel III? We don't know what the specifics are, but as Vice Chair Barr touched on some of the specifics, it looks like capital requirements for yourself and your peers will come down a fair amount from the original proposal.\n",
      "How are you guys thinking about that? Do you have any insights on how much it may fall from the original proposal to where you are today?\n",
      "Jamie Dimon (CEO): Yeah. When I said we're at $30 billion of excess, that is assuming Barr's speech, that the 20% goes to 12% or whatever it is, more. It'll be more than that because there are other factors involved. Now, I was just giving the minimum of excess capital. In my view, it would be more, but it is what it is and we'll wait to see the final numbers.\n",
      "Jeremy Barnum (CFO): But, Gerard, just maybe to give you a bit of color. So, yeah. Obviously, everyone paid a lot of attention to that speech. It was an important speech. But in the end, we actually just really need to see the proposal because the details matter a lot for this stuff. And so our focus is on hoping to see the proposal so that we can process the detail and continue advocating as appropriate.\n",
      "I note that you talk about requirements coming down relative to what was originally proposed which was obviously true per the speech, but I do think we need to be a little bit careful not to fall into the trap of saying that that's like progress just because the original proposal was so dramatically higher than what anyone thought was reasonable. And I would remind you, which you obviously know, that before this proposal came out, it was our position strongly felt, that our then-prevailing capital requirements were, if anything, already more than we needed.\n",
      "So we've got a long way to go here, and I think our position, which Jamie has been articulating very consistently, is that they need to get it right with the right amount of work, and importantly, do it holistically so it's not just Risk-Weighted Assets. It's Risk-Weighted Assets, it's Global Systemically Important Banks, it's SCB, it's Comprehensive Capital Analysis. So that's really what we feel strongly about.\n",
      "Jamie Dimon (CEO): We just want the numbers to be done right and justified. If they had to go up, we would be fine with that too. We just think they should be done with real diligence and real thought and a little bit of thought about cost benefit, what it does to the economy, where it pushes lending and things like that. So we're anxiously awaiting to see the actual detail, because that's what's going to make all the difference.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 4, Justification: The management explicitly avoids providing any specific numerical insight or estimate on 'how much' capital requirements may fall from the original Basel III proposal. Both executives repeatedly state that they need to 'see the proposal' and 'actual detail' because 'details matter,' effectively deferring the question. They pivot to their general stance on capital adequacy and the need for a holistic approach rather than directly addressing the quantification requested.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Glenn Schorr (Analyst): No. That's great for you if you're not hearing much about it, so we can leave it at that. Maybe just one quick follow-up in terms of your just overall posturing. You were patient and smart when rates were low, waited to deploy, worked out great, we know that story. Now, it seems like you have tons of excess liquidity and you're being patient and rates are high, and I'm curious on how you think about what kind of triggers, what kind of things you're looking for in the market to know if and when you would extend duration.\n",
      "Jeremy Barnum (CFO): Right. I mean, on duration, in truth, we have actually added a little bit of duration over the last couple of quarters. So, that's one thing to say. That was more last quarter than this quarter.\n",
      "But, I guess, I would just caution you from a little bit away from looking at kind of our reported cash balances and our balance sheet and concluding that, when you look at the duration concept holistically, that there is a lot to be done differently on the duration front.\n",
      "So, clearly, it's true that empirically we behaved, like very asset-sensitively in this rate hiking cycle and that has resulted in a lot of excess Net Interest Income generation sort of on the way up in the near term.\n",
      "But when we look at the Firm's overall sensitivity to rates, we look at it through both, like the EaR-type lens, a short-term Net Interest Income sensitivity, but also a variety of other lenses, including various types of scenario analysis, including impacts on capital and higher rates. And as I think Jamie has said a couple times, we actually aim to be relatively balanced on that front.\n",
      "Also, given, like the inverted yield curve, it's not as if extending duration from these levels means that you're locking in 5.5% rates. In fact, the forwards are not sort of that compelling given our views about some sort of structural upward pressures on inflation and so on. So, I think when you put that all together, I don't think that kind of a big change in duration posture is a thing that's front of line for us.\n",
      "Glenn Schorr (Analyst): Super helpful. Thanks so much for that.\n",
      "Jeremy Barnum (CFO): Thanks, Glenn.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 2, Justification: The CFO mostly addresses the question by detailing the market conditions (inverted yield curve, uncompelling forward rates given inflation views) that influence their current decision not to extend duration. While not providing explicit 'if-then' triggers, these conditions are implicitly the 'things' they are looking for, and a change in them would serve as triggers. The answer provides a clear rationale for their current posture, with only minor vagueness regarding specific thresholds for future action.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Betsy L. Graseck (Analyst): And what about like a private label credit card, for example.\n",
      "Jamie Dimon (CEO): [indiscernible]\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 5, Justification: The response '[indiscernible]' indicates that the CEO's answer was not audible or comprehensible. As a result, no information was provided in response to the analyst's question, which constitutes a complete avoidance of the question.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Matt O'Connor (Analyst): Got it. Thank you.\n",
      "Mike Mayo (Analyst): Hey. Jamie, I think I've seen you comment on government this year more than any other time in your career. And the August 2 op-ed, Washington Post, Davos you're talking about government. I think it was this week or last week on Bloomberg, you're saying bank mergers should be allowed. Your bus tour in August, you were asked, which is my question now, under what circumstances would you leave for government service and your answer then was “I love what I do.” We get it you love what you do. But under what circumstances would you consider government service? It seems like you'd be more likely to go now than in the past just based on the numerous comments that you've made. Is that right, wrong, what's your thinking?\n",
      "Jamie Dimon (CEO): I think it's wrong. I've always been an American patriot. My country is more important to me than my company, and I think this government is very important to get this – and if you look at the world today, Mike, it is so important that we get things right for the whole geopolitical world. I'm not just talking about the American economy, and we try to participate in policy at the local level, at the state level, at the federal level, at the international level to try to help. That's our job. We try to grow economies and things like that. So nothing has changed in my view, my opinion, or my interest. I just think it's very, very important that we try to help the government do a good job.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 4, Justification: The CEO directly denies the analyst's premise that he might be more likely to consider government service now. However, he completely sidesteps the core question of \"under what circumstances\" he would consider such a role, instead offering general statements about patriotism and the importance of government work without providing any specific criteria or scenarios.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Mike Mayo (Analyst): Let me take the flip side of that question for those of you who are worried about you leaving. The other side of the question is we were on these calls the last couple of years. You're saying the stock is over-valued, and I think that's what you're saying. You're saying the stock market is over-valued and therefore all stocks are over-valued. And on the one hand, you guys, you highlight on this call Artificial Intelligence, tech, market share gains, high returns, high capital. So, do you think in some ways when we think about the value of your price, and your ability to do buybacks, you're thinking more about an old school model for valuing your stock as opposed to a new school model that might put you in the category of more tech-oriented firms, especially as it relates to your progress with Artificial Intelligence.\n",
      "Jamie Dimon (CEO): Listen, you're making a very good point, which is I think we have an exceptional company, exceptional franchises, and the price point at which you might buy the stock. But I'm not that exuberant about thinking even tech valuations or any valuations will stay at these very inflated values. And so I'm just – we're just quite patient in that, and I think you're going to have to judge us over time about whether we're done the right thing to do nothing. And remember, we could always do it. We haven't lost the money. It didn't go away. It's sitting in store. The only time that would be really wrong is if the stock runs way up, we've got to buy at much higher prices. And I just, I would be a real skeptic about that happening.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 4, Justification: The CEO acknowledges the analyst's point but largely avoids directly addressing whether the firm is using an \"old school\" versus \"new school\" model to value its own stock, especially considering its advancements in AI. Instead, the response focuses on general market overvaluation and the patience regarding buybacks, sidestepping the specific inquiry about JPM's internal valuation methodology in light of its tech progress.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Erika Najarian (Analyst): And if I can ask my second question, and, Jamie, I completely understand your frustration. And to be fair, your long-term shareholders really don't care about whether it's $87 billion or $85 billion. Right? They care about your return on equity. To that end, I mean, it's insane how much capital you generate each quarter, 72 basis points this quarter.\n",
      "And so, beyond the standard boilerplate questions you're going to get on buyback and organic growth, yada, yada, dividend increases, how should we think about JPMorgan deploying this capital? I mean, the world is generally your oyster, right? You're dominant already, and you could use this capital to further enhance your business.\n",
      "And again, beyond that boilerplate conversation that you always get every quarter, how should your shareholders think about how you're thinking about the opportunities to deploy this capital?\n",
      "Jamie Dimon (CEO): Okay. First of all, when you say dominant, I'd be very careful on that. We've got some very tough competition, different in different countries, different around the world, fintech companies, direct lenders and I want to give you a very specific comment on direct lending and stuff like that. So our goal is always to serve our clients. And when I talk about some of these expenses, that is a deployment of capital, and it's a deployment in a different way.\n",
      "If you open branches, you initially experience an expense, but down the road you need capital to support the deposits. Same for the Innovation Economy, same for private bankers, et cetera. If you look at it roughly, we have about a minimum $30 billion of excess capital. And for me, it's not burning a hole in my pocket. I look at it as you own the whole company and you can't properly deploy it now, it is perfectly reasonable to wait. And I've been quite clear that I think the future could be quite turbulent. And asset prices, in my view, in life you've got to take a view sometimes, are inflated. I don't know if they're extremely inflated or a little bit, but I prefer to wait.\n",
      "We will be able to deploy it. Our shareholders will be very well served by us waiting. And same thing with deploying capital. We can go buy $100 billion, 6% mortgages, increase our net income by a couple billion tomorrow. We don't make decisions like that. The most important thing we do is serve our clients well, build the technology and do things like that. And we also don’t know what the real excess capital is yet. So, we're a little patient. We're going to be a little patient and wait, and it'll be fine.\n",
      "And so that's where we are, and that's not going to change. And if it changes, we'll let you know. We do talk to a lot of shareholders, and they understand that buying stock back at more than two times tangible book value is not necessarily the best thing to do, because we think we'll have better opportunities to redeploy it or to buy back at cheaper prices at one point. Markets do not stay high forever.\n",
      "Erika Najarian (Analyst): Thank you.\n",
      "Jamie Dimon (CEO): One last thing. Cash is a very valuable asset sometimes in a turbulent world. And you see my friend Warren Buffett stockpiling cash right now. I mean, people should be a little more thoughtful about how we're trying to navigate in this world and grow for the long term for our company.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 2, Justification: The CEO largely addresses the question about capital deployment by clearly stating their strategy of patience and waiting for better opportunities due to market turbulence and inflated asset prices. While there's a minor initial digression about competition, the core of the answer provides specific reasons for their current approach, going beyond generic statements.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Jim Mitchell (Analyst): Oh, hey, good morning. Maybe just one last question on sort of deploying excess capital. It seems like the two primary ways to do that organically would be through the trading book or the loan book. So, maybe two questions there. One, trading assets were up 20% year-over-year. Is that you leaning into it or just a function of demand? And is there further opportunities to grow that?\n",
      "And then, secondly, outside of Card, loan demand has been quite weak and any thoughts from you on if you're seeing any change in demand or how you're thinking about loan demand going forward? Thanks.\n",
      "Jeremy Barnum (CFO): Thanks, Jim. Good questions. So, yeah, trading assets have been up. That is basically client activity, primarily secured financing-related sort of matchbook repo-type stuff and similar things that are – gross up the balance sheet quite a bit, but are quite low risk and therefore, quite low Risk-Weighted Assets intensity.\n",
      "So, while our ability to supply that financing to clients is something that we're happy about and it's very much represents us leaning into the franchise to serve our clients. It's not really particularly Risk-Weighted Assets and therefore, capital intensive and therefore, doesn't really reflect an aggressive choice on our part to deploy capital, so to speak.\n",
      "On the loan demand front, yeah, I mean, unfortunately, I just don't have much new to say there on loan demand, meaning, to your point, loan demand remains quite muted everywhere except Card.\n",
      "Our Card business is, of course, in no way capital constrained. So, whatever growth makes sense there in terms of our customer franchise and our ability to acquire accounts and retain accounts and what fits inside our credit risk appetite, is growth that's going to make sense. And so, we're very happy to deploy capital to that. But it's not constrained by our willingness or ability to deploy capital to that.\n",
      "And, of course, for the rest of the loan space, the last thing that we're going to do is have the excess capital, meaning that we lean into lending that is not inside our risk appetite or inside our credit box, especially in a world where spreads are quite compressed and terms are under pressure.\n",
      "So, there's always a balance between capital deployment and assessing economic risk rationally and frankly, that is, in some sense, a microcosm of the larger challenge that we have right now. When I talked about if there was ever a moment where the opportunity cost of not deploying the capital relative to how attractive the opportunities outside the walls of the company are, now would be it in terms of being patient. That's a little bit one example of what I was referring to.\n",
      "Jim Mitchell (Analyst): Right. Okay. Great. Thanks.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 2, Justification: The CFO directly addresses the analyst's questions regarding loan demand outside of Card, stating it remains muted and explaining their prudent approach to capital deployment in that area. For trading assets, he clarifies their nature as client-driven and low-risk-weighted, explaining why they are not a significant capital deployment strategy. While not explicitly stating 'yes' or 'no' on 'further opportunities to grow' trading assets, the explanation provided is specific and relevant to the overarching theme of capital deployment.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Gerard Cassidy (Analyst): Very good. Appreciate the color and candor, as always. Thank you.\n",
      "Matt O'Connor (Analyst): Good morning. So lower rates was supposed to drive a pick-up in loan growth and conversion of some of these investment banking pipelines. Obviously, we just had one cut and it's early. But any beginning signs of this in terms of the interest in borrowing more, and again, conversion of the banking pipelines?\n",
      "Jeremy Barnum (CFO): I would say, Matt, generally no, frankly, with a couple of minor exceptions. So I think it's probably fair to say that the outperformance late in the quarter in investment banking fees was to a meaningful degree, as I mentioned, driven by Debt Capital Markets as well as to some degree driven by the acceleration of the closing of some Mergers & Acquisitions transactions. And I do think that some of that Debt Capital Markets outperformance is in the sort of types of deals that are opportunistic deals that aren't in our pipeline, and those are often driven by treasurers and CFOs sort of seeing improvement in market levels and jumping on those. So it's possible that that's a little bit of a consequence of the cuts.\n",
      "As I think I mentioned we did see, for example, a pick-up in mortgage applications and a tiny bit of pick-up in refi. And our multi-family lending business, there might be some hints of more activity there. But these cuts were very heavily priced. Right? The curve has been inverted for a long time. So to a large degree, this is expected. So it's not obvious to me that you should expect immediate dramatic reactions, and that's not really what we're seeing.\n",
      "Jamie Dimon (CEO): Yeah. And also in the debt markets, rates came down, spreads are quite low, and markets are wide open. So it kind of makes sense that people are taking advantage of that today. Those conditions may not prevail, be the ongoing conditions late next year.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 2, Justification: The CFO directly answers \"generally no\" to the question about beginning signs of increased borrowing or pipeline conversion due to lower rates. While he qualifies this with minor exceptions and explanations about market dynamics and priced-in expectations, the response is clear and mostly addresses the analyst's inquiry without significant deflection or vagueness. He provides a direct answer and supports it with reasoning and nuanced details.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Betsy L. Graseck (Analyst): What about loans? The Apple card…\n",
      "Jamie Dimon (CEO): But creating those assets to help clients. That's a whole different matter because when it comes to clients, we earn credit asset spread and we usually have other stuff. If our bankers can deploy capital that way, of course be that we want to do more. And our CIO could deploy capital in multiple ways, we would probably do more. And we ask all the time can we do more in affordable housing, can we do more in things we're actually quite comfortable. And yeah, if we could find ways to deploy capital, we would be happy to do that. But put us in your closest category...\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 5, Justification: The CEO completely sidestepped the specific question about the Apple Card and provided only generic statements about deploying capital. The response lacked any specific details or direct information regarding the company's loan portfolio or the mentioned product, offering no relevant information to the inquiry.\n",

      "Betsy L. Graseck (Analyst): I'm just wondering about private label credit card for example. Is that something that would help clients?\n",
      "Jamie Dimon (CEO): Almost no chance.\n",
      "Well, but having – it's very important. While I say that, I always tell the management team second-guess me. I mean, we’ve done private label. I know what it is, we've been there. I have a lot of issues with it. But is it possible it's going to be different one day and a different thing? Yeah, it's possible, so I don't want to cut it off. If Marianne Lake says to me, Jamie I think clearly the world's changed, we're going to change. But right now, we'd say no, there's no chance.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 1, Justification: The CEO directly answers the question about private label credit cards, stating there is \"almost no chance\" and providing a clear rationale based on past experience and current assessment. Despite a slight caveat for the distant future, the immediate response is unambiguous and to the point.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Betsy L. Graseck (Analyst): Okay. Then one for Jamie. Jamie, we did talk already quite a bit about the capital that you have, capital in store. Just wanted to understand how you're thinking about that opportunity set that's in front of you with regard to using it for potentially portfolio acquisitions. I realize that depositories are not on the docket, but we all know there's portfolios out there that might be looking for a home. And could you give us a sense as to how interested you might be in acquiring assets at this stage?\n",
      "Jamie Dimon (CEO): Yeah. So asset acquisitions, I mean I always want our people to be looking at those things and thinking about those things. But if you listen to what I'm saying about my caution about the world, it's hard for me to say that we're going to be in the market to buy credit assets.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 2, Justification: The CEO provides a clear indication that the bank is unlikely to pursue asset acquisitions at this time, linking this stance to his broader caution about the world. While phrased softly (\"it's hard for me to say\"), the message about their low interest in being in the market for credit assets is effectively conveyed.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Mike Mayo (Analyst): So, you'll stay around maybe for a few more years base case right now?\n",
      "Jamie Dimon (CEO): Basic case, yeah.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 1, Justification: The CEO's response directly confirms the 'base case' assumption made by the analyst regarding his tenure. It is a clear and concise answer that fully addresses the question.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Steven Chubak (Analyst): Hi. Good morning. So Jeremy, how are you? So I do want to ask on expenses, just in light of some of the comments that Daniel had made recently, just noting that consensus expense forecast for next year looked a little bit too light. I believe at the time it was just below $94 billion.\n",
      "If we adjust for the one-timers this year, that would suggest a core expense base that's just below $90 billion, so pretty healthy step-up in expenses. I know you've always had a strong commitment and discipline around investment. Just want to better understand where those incremental dollars are being deployed and just which investments are being prioritized in particular looking out to next year.\n",
      "Jeremy Barnum (CFO): Sure. So good question and I agree with your numbers. I agree with the way you've normalized this year for the one-time type of significant items and also where the consensus was when Daniel made his comments.\n",
      "And while we're at it, I would also just remind you on the Net Interest Income comments at the time, the consensus for this year was $91.5 billion and for next year it was $90 billion so that was implying at the time a sequential decline of $1.5 billion. It was because we felt that decline wasn't big enough that we made the comments that we made. So happy to expand more on that, but anyway.\n",
      "To expenses. Yeah. So if you start for the sake of argument with a base of $90 billion, obviously, inflation is normalizing and obviously we're always trying to generate efficiencies to offset inflation. But, that having been said, if you assume 3% for the sake of argument on that base, that's a few billion dollars right out of the gates that we're working against. So that's one thing.\n",
      "The other thing is that we have continued to execute on our growth strategies this year so there's a not insignificant amount of annualization. You can't quite see that in the fourth quarter numbers because of the seasonality of incentive comp., but if you were to strip that out, you would see probably some sequential increases and so annualization as an additional headwind.\n",
      "The other thing that's worth noting is that we do expect fees and volume-related businesses to grow next year. And so all else being equal, that would come with a higher expense loading. So when you assemble all of those, that goes a long way to explain why sort of that consensus number that is slightly below $94 billion just seemed light.\n",
      "In terms of priorities and investments, really nothing has changed, like the strategy hasn't changed. The strategy hasn't changed and the plans haven't changed and we're just kind of executing with the same long-term perspective that we've always had.\n",
      "I would note that relative to Net Interest Income, obviously, we're in the third quarter now, not the fourth quarter. And in the old days, we did used to give you the guidance until Investor Day in late February. So we will give you formal expense guidance next quarter for both, well, for expenses and Net Interest Income next quarter. But especially on expenses, we are in the middle of the budget cycle right now so we probably have a little less visibility there than we do at the margin on Net Interest Income.\n",
      "Jamie Dimon (CEO): And can I just give you just a view of expense a little bit? What you call expenses very often I call investments. If you actually go back to Investor Day, you'll see that we're adding private bankers in Asset & Wealth Management, we're adding ETF in Asset & Wealth Management, we're adding private bankers in international Private Banking. We're growing Chase Wealth Management. We've added some branches across the United States of America. We think there are huge opportunities for Innovation Economy that takes bankers and certain technology, stuff like that.\n",
      "Our goal is to gain share and everything we do, we get really good returns on it. So I look at that, these are opportunities for us. These are not expenses that we have to actually punish ourself on. And we do get, and we show you kind of extensively cost and productivity on various things. And also Artificial Intelligence is going to go up a little bit and I would put that as a category that just is going to generate great stuff over time.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 2, Justification: While the CFO initially indicates they are in the middle of the budget cycle and defers formal guidance, the CEO steps in to provide several concrete examples of areas where incremental dollars are being deployed and investments are prioritized. These include adding private bankers, growing wealth management, expanding branches, and investing in AI, which directly addresses the core of the analyst's question.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Mike Mayo (Analyst): So if you were asked by the next administration to serve the country, would you be open to considering it?\n",
      "Jamie Dimon (CEO): I think the chance of that is almost nil and I probably am not going to do it, but I've always reserved the right. I don't make promise to people. I don't have to. But no, I love what I do. I intend to be doing what I'm doing. I almost guarantee I'll be doing this for a long period of time or at least until the board kicks me out.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 3, Justification: The CEO provides a mixed message. While he states the chance of serving the country is \"almost nil\" and he \"probably\" won't take such a role, he explicitly adds that he has \"always reserved the right.\" This qualification prevents a direct 'no' to being open to considering it, making the answer somewhat vague about his true willingness to entertain the idea despite his strong stated commitment to his current position.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Steven Chubak (Analyst): Thank you both for the color. Just a quick follow-up for me, just drilling down into Net Interest Income. It appears you redeployed a fair amount of cash or excess reserves at the Fed into securities. We saw the yield expand, which was encouraging, despite the pressure at both the long end and SOFR contraction in the quarter. I was hoping you could just speak to your appetite to extend duration in this environment.\n",
      "I know that you've had some aversion to that in the past. But do you anticipate redeploying additional excess liquidity just amid the expectation for deeper rate cuts?\n",
      "Jeremy Barnum (CFO): Yeah. Sure. So on extending duration, Steve, you know this obviously, but I just think it's important to say that all else equal, extending duration doesn't change expected Net Interest Income if you assume that the policy rate follows the forward, right? So, point one.\n",
      "Point two, the curve remains inverted. And so even if you don't believe that the policy rate follows the forwards, extending right now is actually a headwind to short-term Net Interest Income like that wouldn't be a consideration for us either way, but I just think that's worth saying for the broader audience. It's quite different from the situation that you have on the numbers...\n",
      "Jamie Dimon (CEO): ... people have mortgages at 6%, so, right.\n",
      "Jeremy Barnum (CFO): Yeah. Now so when we think of the question of extending duration and really managing duration right now, a couple things to say. So, obviously, a lot of different versions of duration, but one number that we disclose is the EaR. When the 10-Q comes out, you'll see that that number is a little bit lower. It'll come down from $2.8 billion to about $2.1 billion if our current estimates are correct. That's for a number of reasons, some of which are passive, but some of those are active choices to extend duration a little bit.\n",
      "And in the end, the choice to manage and extend duration is really about balancing the volatility of Net Interest Income against protecting the company from extreme scenarios on either side. And so right now, if we wanted to extend as a result of different factors, we certainly could. We have the capacity inside the portfolio. But for now, we're comfortable with where we are.\n",
      "Jamie Dimon (CEO): And the one thing I can assure you is the forward curve will not be the same forward curve in six months.\n",
      "Steven Chubak (Analyst): Well said. Well, thank you so much for taking my questions.\n",
      "Jeremy Barnum (CFO): Thanks, Steve.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 4, Justification: The response includes extensive theoretical context and general statements about duration management before partially addressing the question. While it acknowledges some active, albeit 'little bit,' duration extension, it avoids a direct answer regarding the appetite or anticipation for significant additional redeployment of excess liquidity, concluding vaguely with 'comfortable with where we are for now.'\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Ebrahim H. Poonawala (Analyst): Yeah, good morning. I guess just wanted to follow-up. You talked about private credit and the disruption to bank lending. Another area I would appreciate if you can address is we've been hearing a lot about the likes of Jane Street and other market makers potentially disrupting fixed income trading. Is that a real risk? And is there an opportunity for a firm like JPMorgan to actually compete on the private venue side on market making beyond traditional sort of FICC activity?\n",
      "Jeremy Barnum (CFO): Yeah, Ebrahim, the way I would frame that is not as a risk but as a reality. We've always emphasized in all of our businesses that we operate in an extremely competitive environment, and that applies to – and that competitive environment isn't limited to competing against banks or traditional financial institutions. It extends in the consumer space to fintechs. And in the market making space, it obviously increasingly is extending to some of the types of firms that you're referring to.\n",
      "Now those firms are, in many cases, also clients. And that's the same type of dynamic that you see, for example, in the private credit space that we've discussed before. So there's no question that the ecosystem is changing. You've got new competitors. You've got changes in market structure, new dynamics. And as with any business, we are innovating and adjusting and making sure that we're prepared to compete in all the traditional ways and all the new ways.\n",
      "Of course, there are some ways in which being a bank hinders our ability to do that. And one of the arguments that we've made going back to the capital and liquidity regulations is that when you come to the impact on the kind of U.S. capital markets ecosystem, which is the end view of the world, its worked well in its current construct for a long time where some activities were inside the regulated perimeter and there was robust participation from unregulated capital of various sorts. And a world where more and more of that activity gets pushed outside of bank market makers is a meaningful change to that structure that is untested, and it's unclear why you would want that. And we've cautioned that if that's the intent of the regulations, it should be intentional and well-studied. But in the meantime, we're going to adjust and compete to the best of our ability given the constraints of the current rule set.\n",
      "Jamie Dimon (CEO): The previous answer on the private markets, it remains to be seen how that develops. There is a little bit of that, and some people are talking about making more active things in private markets. In some ways we're well-positioned for that too, because for that you need liquidity, market-making valuation, buyers and sellers on both sides to create liquidity. So that hasn't developed yet, but we may have competition, but we'll be there when the time comes.\n",
      "And the second one is the public markets. You have seen reports about you have deal inventories, both corporate and treasuries. And I do think that's capital. But again, we do it, remember, for clients. So we are large market makers on both sides of the markets for clients in both credit and treasuries, which is a little different than some of the other people just trading for their own account. And so they are both competition from our standpoint, but we're there. We're going to do it. We're can always deploy more capital if we want. And we would even deploy more capital at lower returns if we really had to do that to service clients. So we're very conscious of it. There will be competition both sides. As Jeremy said, we sat here 10 years ago talking about the electronification of the business and can we keep up with that, and so far we have.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 2, Justification: The executives directly acknowledge the competitive 'reality' rather than dismissing the risk. They also explain how JPMorgan is positioned to compete in this evolving landscape, referencing their client-centric model, capital, and commitment to adapting. While there is a slight tangent into regulatory implications, the core questions regarding risk and opportunity are mostly addressed.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "John McDonald (Analyst): Hi. Good morning. Jeremy, I wanted to ask about capital, and I know you get this question a lot about the kind of high-class dilemma of your growing capital base and your perspective of that as earnings in store. So, I guess, what's the framework for thinking about the opportunity cost of sitting on the growing base of capital and how high you might let that go versus your patience in waiting for more attractive deployment opportunities?\n",
      "Jeremy Barnum (CFO): Yeah. Good question, John, and welcome back, by the way.\n",
      "John McDonald (Analyst): Thank you.\n",
      "Jamie Dimon (CEO): Welcome back, John. Read your piece the other day. It took me quite a while, but it was good work.\n",
      "John McDonald (Analyst): Thanks.\n",
      "Jeremy Barnum (CFO): So, yeah, you've noted all the points that we always make so I won't repeat them. And I think the way we're thinking about it right now is that we feel very comfortable with the notion that it makes sense for us to have a nice store of extra capital in light of the current environment. We believe there's a good chance that there will be a moment where we get to deploy it at better levels essentially in whatever way than the current opportunities would suggest. And so that feels like a correct kind of strategic and financial decision for us. Having said that, having studied it quite extensively over the last six months and have all the debates that you would expect, we've concluded that we do have enough. We have enough excess. And given that, we would like to not have the excess grow from here.\n",
      "So, when you think about the implications of that, given the amount of organic capital generation that we're producing, it means that unless we find in the near term opportunities for organic deployment or otherwise, it means more capital return through buybacks, all else being equal, in order to arrest the growth of the excess. And that is our current plan, although, I'll give the caveat that, as you know, is in our disclosure, which is we don't want to get in the business of guiding on buybacks, and we reserve the right to change the trajectory at any time for any reason, but that is our current thinking.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 1, Justification: The CFO directly addresses the analyst's question about the capital framework, stating their comfort with current levels, the desire not to let excess capital grow further, and their plan to return capital via buybacks if deployment opportunities don't arise. The answer is clear, specific, and provides the requested framework.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Erika Najarian (Analyst): My first question, and thank you very much for answering all the Net Interest Income questions so far, Jeremy, is just I guess another follow-up. As you can imagine, once Daniel said what he said on stage in September, everyone is trying to figure out the over/under for net interest income next year. So maybe a two-part first question, the second being inspired by what Jamie just said.\n",
      "Number one, Net Interest Income is expected to be down 6% sequentially in fourth quarter. I think year-over-year in 2025, consensus has it down 4% from your new level. So it sounds like consensus still has room to come down, and based on the forward curve, Jeremy, it could be a little bit worse year-over-year than the fourth quarter sequential rate.\n",
      "But that being said, as Jamie noted, we have no idea what the curve is going to look like. Right? It's gyrated so much. And so as we think about the curve, is it better for JPMorgan to have more cuts in the short end but steepness or less cuts but a little bit of a flatter curve?\n",
      "Jeremy Barnum (CFO): Right. Okay. You threw a curve ball at the end there, Erika. I wasn't expecting that to be the end of your question. But let me answer the beginning of your question, and then I'll also answer the end of your question.\n",
      "So we see the current 2025 consensus for Net Interest Income ex. Markets to be currently at $87 billion, which is obviously lower than it was at the conference earlier in the quarter. So we're happy to see that move a little bit more in line to us. That still looks a little toppy, but it's definitely in the ballpark.\n",
      "Now that consists of, I already mentioned previously that we sort of expect the Net Interest Income trough sometime in the middle of the year, so you can kind of assemble the parts. You've got a fourth quarter run rate, you've got some sequential declines, you've got a trough in the middle of the year, and you've got a rough ballpark for the full year.\n",
      "So you can imagine that the trough probably is a little lower than those numbers and then to the extent that growth revolve resumes in the back half of the year in both deposit balances and the ongoing tailwind of Card revolve, although that tailwind will be a little bit less than you might have otherwise thought. I mean, sorry. A little bit less than it was this year but still a tailwind.\n",
      "Obviously, the mix of those things will play out in different ways, and as you point out, who knows what the yield curve will wind up doing. But on our current assumptions, on the current yield curve, and remembering that we're in the third quarter now, so we're doing this kind of early, that's what we think.\n",
      "Jamie Dimon (CEO): Can I just say something. First of all, next time let's just give them the damn number. I don't want to spend all the time on these calls like going through what they're guessing what Net Interest Income is going to be next year.\n",
      "Can I just also point out that Net Interest Income, all things being equal, is a number, but all things are never equal. And the yield curve, if you have a recession the effect of the yield curve will be very different than if you have continued growth. And there are decisions that are made nonstop by us and the things that happen in the marketplace, and I think we spend too much time on just this irrelevancy so you get a model, a number in your model. And so it's going to be less than $87 billion next year. Probably not a lot, we don't know, and we don't know the environment.\n",
      "Jeremy Barnum (CFO): Good. Okay. Now to your question about the EaR. So, a few things to say in there. So, as I already mentioned, when that comes out, it'll show a number around $2.1 billion. A very important thing to say is, as you know, the experience of this rate cycle has been that our empirical EaR is meaningfully higher than our modeled EaR, which is what we disclose. And the main reason for that is that retail deposit betas have, in actuality, been lower than the modeled deposit betas.\n",
      "So as a starting point, you have to kind of adjust that EaR number to be bigger than the reported number for those and a few other reasons, actually, there's some nuances around how the dollar, non-dollar sensitivity interact. And then there's your question which is a little bit about the front-end versus the back-end.\n",
      "So, what you see is that actually the front-end EaR has gotten smaller and most of the EaR is now in the back-end. So, it's definitely the case that, all else being equal, a steeper curve is better for us. But I think what I would also say is that this kind of empirical versus theoretical adjustment is disproportionately in the front-end. So therefore, in order to answer your question, I would say, yes, we want a steeper curve, but having the Fed cut more than what's currently in the yield curve is definitely at the margin, for the context of next year's numbers a headwind – would be a headwind for us, we remain asset sensitive to Fed cuts.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 3, Justification: The response is a mixed bag. For the Net Interest Income question, management confirms consensus is 'a little toppy' and will be 'less than $87 billion' but avoids giving a specific revised number or range, asking the analyst to 'assemble the parts' themselves. However, the second part of the question regarding yield curve sensitivity and preference is answered directly and with good detail, explaining their asset sensitivity and the impact of various scenarios.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Jim Mitchell (Analyst): Yeah. No, that makes sense. And maybe just as a follow-up, just on loan growth. Have you – since the election, it seems like CEO confidence, business confidence has increased. So, are you starting to see any improvement in demand on lending? Just any thoughts there would be great.\n",
      "Jeremy Barnum (CFO): Yeah, it's a good question. And I think given the significant improvement in business sentiment and the general optimism out there, you might have expected to see some pickup in loan growth. We are not really seeing that. I don't particularly think that's a negative. I think it's probably explained by a combination of wide-open capital markets, and so many of the larger corporates accessing the capital markets and healthy balance sheets in small businesses and maybe some residual caution. And maybe there are some pockets and some industries where some aspects of the policy uncertainty that we might be facing are making them a little bit more cautious than they otherwise would be about what they're executing in the near-term. But, we'll see what the new year brings as the current optimism starts getting tested with reality, one way or the other.\n",
      "And maybe if it materializes with tangible improvements and things one way or the other, you'll actually see that come through C&I loan growth in particular.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 1, Justification: The CFO directly addresses the question about seeing improvement in loan demand by clearly stating, \"We are not really seeing that.\" The response then provides specific and detailed reasons for this observation, fully engaging with the analyst's inquiry without deflection.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Ebrahim H. Poonawala (Analyst): Got it. And just one quick one. And, Jeremy, you, I think, mentioned QT stopping at some point. We saw the repo sort of market spike at the end of September. Give us your perspective on just the risk of market liquidity shock as we move into year-end and do you have a view on how quickly Fed should recalibrate QT or actually stop QT to prevent some loss? Thanks.\n",
      "Jeremy Barnum (CFO): Yeah. It's a good question, Ebrahim. But I think you've kind of answered your own question. In other words, like the argument out there is that the repo spike that we saw at the end of this quarter was an indication that maybe the market is approaching that lowest comfortable level of reserves that's been heavily speculated about. And recognizing that that number is probably higher and driven by the evolution of firm's liquidity requirements as opposed to some of the more traditional measures.\n",
      "And side point, it's just another reason why it's important to look at the whole framework holistically when we think about the regulatory response of the events of two springs ago. You don't want those types of spikes and it raises some questions about why there isn't more readiness to deploy into those types of disruptions, albeit this one was relatively minor.\n",
      "But in any case, when you put all that together, it would seem to add some weight to the notion that maybe QT should be wound down and that seems to be increasingly the consensus that that's going to get announced at some point in the fourth quarter. So my only point was if you play that view through, it's a residual headwind for system-wide deposit growth which gets removed. And that's one of the reasons that we feel that we're probably in the trough of our deposit balances at the level of...\n",
      "Jamie Dimon (CEO): So I just want to add a couple policy things here. I'm not actually sure they can actually do that, because you have inflationary factors out there, partially driven by QE. And also, look at the volatility. It's not a risk to JPMorgan. It's a risk to the system. And what banks have, I already mentioned the constrained balance sheet a little bit. So the banks will have trillions of dollars of cash and unable to deploy the repo markets. And is it a good policy thing that every time that happens, because you can do it very safely, fully collateralized, all things like that, providing what I call flexible financing in the marketplace, that that happens, the Fed has to step in every time? I think that becomes a policy issue that every time there's some kind of fluctuation in the market, people panic and the Fed has got to step in and provide stuff. And can they always do that if you have a slightly more inflationary environment going forward?\n",
      "So I think you've got to be very thoughtful about this and that's why we do think they should look at calibrating SLR and ECLR and Common Equity Tier 1, all of these things, particularly for this. So my view is, it is going to happen again. I can't tell you exactly when, but I'd be surprised if it doesn't happen again.\n",
      "Ebrahim H. Poonawala (Analyst): Got it. Thank you both.\n",
      "Betsy L. Graseck (Analyst): Oh, hi. Good morning.\n",
      "Jeremy Barnum (CFO): Hey, Betsy.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 4, Justification: The executives largely avoided providing a direct perspective on how quickly the Fed should adjust QT or a specific year-end liquidity risk assessment. Instead, they redirected to market consensus, broader systemic policy issues, and general statements about the risk's recurrence, rather than offering their firm's specific view or a precise forecast as requested.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Mike Mayo (Analyst): All right. Thank you.\n",
      "Jim Mitchell (Analyst): Hey. Good morning. Maybe just on regulation, we have a new administration coming in. We have a new, soon-to-be, I guess, a new head of regulation at the Fed. So, maybe just talk about, again, what areas of the regulatory structure, if it were to change, would be most impactful for you. And is there any areas where you think capital requirements could actually go down? Or is this more of a story of requirements just simply stop going up? Thanks.\n",
      "Jeremy Barnum (CFO): Hey, Jim. I mean, it's obviously something we're thinking about a lot. But I could go down some pretty deep rabbit holes speculating on all the different parts of the framework and how they could evolve, and I just don't really think that's productive right now. But let me make some attempt to answer your question. So, backing up a second, if you read Jamie's quotes, they're very consistent with what we've been saying as a company for a long time, which is that all we want is a coherent, rational, holistically-assessed regulatory framework that allows banks to do their job, supporting the economy, that isn't reflexively anti-bank, that doesn't default to the answer to every question being more of\n",
      "everything, more capital, more liquidity, that uses data and that balances the obvious goal that we all share of a safe and sound banking system with actually recognizing that banks play a critical role in supporting growth, and the hope is that we get some of that.\n",
      "And that also, while we're at it, some aspects of the supervisory framework get a little bit less bureaucratic and a little less adversarial and a little bit more substantive so that at the margin, management can focus its time on the things that matter the most. So, whether capital goes up, down, stays flat is really so complicated because it's not just Basel III Endgame, it's also a Global Systemically Important Banks, it's also a number of other factors. And that's why we keep hammering away on the importance of doing all of this holistically, properly with the right analysis. And if that takes time, so be it.\n",
      "Jamie Dimon (CEO): Can I just add, no that's great. Jeremy gave it all. Let me add three quick things. Liquidity is also equally important. There's been a lot of recognition that what counts as liquidity and discount windows and how Liquidity Coverage Ratio Market. is done I think is very important. Second is competition. All these things should be done in light of looking at what kind of public markets you want, what kind of private markets you want, what do you want in the banking system, what you want out of the banking system. And the third is I think most people realize there is a huge need to take a step back and look at the Byzantine, Balkanized system we built which has negatives, and even the regulators will tell you that. So, at one point, just take a deep breath. As Jeremy said, let's do the right thing and continue to have the best financial system in the world.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 4, Justification: The executives acknowledged the question but provided a general, philosophical discussion about their desired regulatory framework rather than identifying specific areas that would impact them. They explicitly stated it was too \"complicated\" to speculate on capital requirements decreasing, thereby avoiding a direct answer to that part of the question.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Betsy L. Graseck (Analyst): Oh, yes. Thank you. So one for Jeremy, one for Jamie. Jeremy and Jamie, Sorry about the Net Interest Income question I'm going to have, but it is more than half your revenue so I kind of care about it.\n",
      "But when I'm thinking about the trough and then the build-up, QT ending, deposit growth, I mean, that's part of the calculation for improvement as we go into 2025. Right? I should embed that outlook. Is that right? And that's embedded in how you're thinking about it. I know we don't have a number for you for Net Interest Income for 2025 but it is in there. Right?\n",
      "Jeremy Barnum (CFO): Yeah. In other words, it goes back to my prior point and to the point that I had in the prepared remarks about the consumer deposit balances in particular –\n",
      "Betsy L. Graseck (Analyst): Right.\n",
      "Jeremy Barnum (CFO): – that there's lots of different offsetting factors right now, right. You've got the yield curve, you've got Card revolve, you've got balances. And balances have been a headwind. We now see it as neutral and they could potentially become a tailwind later in the year. And one of the potential reasons for that is – one of the potential reasons for that is the potential end of QT, but emphasize the word potential, to Jamie's point.\n",
      "You also obviously have a little bit of the fixed asset, fixed-rate asset reprice dynamics starting to flow through a little bit. While we're on Net Interest Income, just to annoy Jamie a little bit more, I do want to make a point that I didn't get a chance to make previously, which is there's a reason that we emphasize the implied fourth quarter run rate for the Markets Net Interest Income in the presentation which is that if you take that and you annualize it, it gives you a launch point run rate, which is significantly higher than what's currently in the consensus and obviously what we've seen this year. And I'll give you the concise version of my usual speech that changes in Markets Net Interest Income are almost always bottom-line neutral and offset in Non-interest Revenue. But for the purposes of trying to help you guys with your models, I would just encourage you to recognize what that launch point is, the number of cuts that are in the curve, the fact that that number has historically and in the recent past has been quite liability-sensitive, so you can draw your own conclusions about what that should mean. Again, shouldn't change the overall revenue expectation. It's just a balance sheet and income statement geography issue. But just for the sake of helping you tidy up models, I wanted to make that point.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 4, Justification: The CFO partially acknowledges the factors (QT, deposit growth) but qualifies their impact with 'potential' and 'could,' avoiding a direct confirmation that they are 'embedded' in their 2025 outlook. A substantial part of the answer then redirects to an unsolicited discussion about Markets Net Interest Income, which, while related to NII, deflects from the core of the analyst's question about the firm's overall 2025 NII expectations.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Betsy L. Graseck (Analyst): Thank you so much.\n",
      "Saul Martinez (Analyst): Hey. Good morning. I'm not going to ask about a specific Net Interest Income in 2025, but I did want to delve into the how to think about your deposit margin in volume dynamics in the Citi Commercial Bank over the next few years. You have seen a decent amount of pressure in the deposit margin, 2.6%, down about 30 basis points as deposit balances have come down, so it put some pressure on deposit Net Interest Income. But deposit margins are still well above where they were when rates were at levels that are consistent with where the forward curve now has been going. So I guess how do we think about both volumes and margin dynamics if rates do come down, say, to the level that are consistent with the forward curve? I know the forward curve is likely going to be long, but that's the reference point we have.\n",
      "And conversely, volume offset. You mentioned, Jeremy, the retail deposits becoming a tailwind. But, I guess, how much of a tailwind could they be, especially as you are expecting to gain quite a bit of market share in retail deposits? So just give us a sense of sort of the push and pull of these dynamics that really help drive the deposit, the value of the deposit franchise.\n",
      "Jeremy Barnum (CFO): Sure. Yeah, thanks for the question, Saul. And I think you've laid out the building blocks there already. Just for simplicity, I'm going to try to answer your question without referring to the disclosed Citi Commercial Bank deposit margin number, just because that number is obviously the combination of the rate paid on the Citi Commercial Bank deposits and the internal FTP into that. And that is a complicated thing that evolves as a function of the modeling of the betas and other things. So I think it's actually more helpful to look at this simply from a Firmwide perspective and look at the evolution of the rate paid in the context of the policy rates roughly, and just set aside the duration management and all those sort of factors.\n",
      "And I think when you do that, what you see is we've been saying for a while that the deposit margin defined for these purposes is simply the difference between the policy rate and the weighted-average rate paid of the consumer deposits, was unsustainably high. And that was going to have to correct one way or the other. Either deposits were going to reprice at the product level through checking and savings, and/or we were going to see a ton of internal migration, i.e. growth in the CD mix, and/or we would see a lower policy rate. So as we sit here right now, of course, we make pricing decisions in the context of market competition at any given moment looking at what the environment is for deposits, but we have not needed to reprice in order to retain primary bank relationships which was also our core strategy. We were never going to chase sort of the hot money at the margin.\n",
      "We've leaned in heavily to CDs and gotten to the current level of CD mix, and that's been a good strategy. And from where we sit now, we now have the margin coming down as a result of the policy rate coming down. It seems that, that puts us in a pretty comfortable position from a pricing perspective. We think the CD mix has probably peaked.\n",
      "Now, on the way down, it's not going to go back down to zero, where it was at the beginning of the cycle. That's an important thing to realize. So all else equal, that creates a little bit of margin compression. And then through all of that, obviously, a lower yield environment should mean that there's a little bit less outflow from consumer deposits, as I mentioned. We're seeing a lot less yield-seeking behavior. So then when you overlay on to that what you mentioned, which is our long-term share growth in Citi Commercial Bank deposits, in no small part as a function of the brand strategy and the buildout and the fact that only about a quarter of our top 125 markets in Citi Commercial Bank are at that 15% share number, so we believe there's big opportunity to grow the rest of it and be on track at the type of average annual share growth of the order of 30 basis points or 40 basis points that we've seen historically. That's how you kind of assemble a tailwind from normalized deposit margin and balance growth in Consumer.\n",
      "Jamie Dimon (CEO): Jeremy, correct me if you think I'm wrong. The abnormal time period was when rates were between 0% and 1% or 2%. Other than that, if you're looking at, say, what are normal deposit margins in the normal banking business, forget people going after really hot money if that happens, it's 2% to 2.5%.\n",
      "Jeremy Barnum (CFO): Absolutely. Yeah, we agree.\n",
      "Saul Martinez (Analyst): Okay. That's helpful. So it sounds like you're a little bit above that, but there's still some pressure. But you're not dramatically above those levels.\n",
      "Jamie Dimon (CEO): Very good returns in business in both Banking & Wealth Management. We're growing market share. And when we build branches and stuff like that, we don't necessarily assume current margins. We look at what would be normal margins over time. And we're very comfortable doing very nice business for you all.\n",
      "Saul Martinez (Analyst): Yes. Got it. Okay. That's helpful. Thanks a lot. That's all I got.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 4, Justification: The CFO explicitly stated he would not address the specific Citi Commercial Bank deposit margin number and instead shifted the discussion to a firmwide perspective on deposit margin normalization. While the answer did eventually loop back to CCB volume growth potential, it deliberately avoided the analyst's core question regarding the specific margin dynamics within the Citi Commercial Bank if rates were to decline.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Matt O'Connor (Analyst): Okay. And then just separately, a strategic question. There's been some reports about you further expanding the Consumer Banking business globally. And I guess I just want to push on that where we really haven't seen other banks do it in a successful way. Obviously, your approach is kind of coming from a position of strength, leading digitally. But I guess I'm just wondering like is it worth it? Is there enough upside to justify maybe some of the increased regulatory and execution risk of doing global consumer banking?\n",
      "Jeremy Barnum (CFO): Yeah. I think you kind of answered your own questions in a sense, like we talked about this a lot when we first launched the initiative. And I just think that the comparison to other players is not apt in the current moment. That's not to say that like we're special or anything. It's just that the strategy is very different and it's a very different moment. So it's a new initiative. It's obviously not risk-free, but it's going pretty well. And pointing out the obvious, if we didn't think it was worth it, we wouldn't be doing it. But we have obviously considered all of the risks and opportunities associated with the decision. And it's one of our strategic initiatives, and those get scrutinized quite aggressively through all of our management processes.\n",
      "Matt O'Connor (Analyst): Okay. Thank you.\n",
      "Betsy L. Graseck (Analyst): Hi. Good morning.\n",
      "Jeremy Barnum (CFO): Hey, Betsy.\n",
      "Jamie Dimon (CEO): Hey, Betsy.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 4, Justification: The CFO largely avoided the core question of whether the global consumer banking expansion is 'worth it' and if there is 'enough upside to justify' the risks, especially given past failures of other banks. Instead of providing specific justifications or differentiating factors, the CFO offered general reassurances and used circular logic ('if we didn't think it was worth it, we wouldn't be doing it'), failing to address the analyst's strategic concerns directly.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Mike Mayo (Analyst): Who's your successor?\n",
      "Jamie Dimon (CEO): Oh, yeah. This is an unfortunate thing for any big company like this where these people have to be in the spotlight all the time and always to-ing and fro-ing. We have several exceptional people. You guys know most of them. There's maybe one or two you don't know. The Board reviews and meets with them all the time. I think it's wonderful that Jenn Piepszak, who does not want to be the CEO, will be here as Chief Operating Officer and stay after that. So, obviously, she's going to work with those people which I think is great for a company, just having continuity of management and leadership, and will be one of those people. And obviously, we're not going to tell the press, but it's not determined yet. And of course, the last minute, a couple years from now people get sick, they change their mind, have family circumstances. So, even if you thought you knew today, you couldn't be completely sure.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 5, Justification: The CEO completely avoids identifying a successor. While acknowledging a pool of potential candidates and the board's involvement, he explicitly states that the decision is \"not determined yet\" and they \"are not going to tell the press,\" directly declining to answer the specific question asked.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Ken Usdin (Analyst): Yeah. And just one question on the Net Interest Income ex. Markets holding at $90 billion. Can you just walk us through the puts and takes of just what's the new curve you're using, which also is subject to change every day and what might have been some of the positive offsets to if you put in more expected cuts than you had before? Thanks.\n",
      "Jeremy Barnum (CFO): Yeah, that's a good question, Ken. You're right. So if you remember, last quarter we said that we had one cut in the curve. I think latest curve has something like three cuts. And so, we've talked a lot, obviously, about how we are asset sensitive. You now see our EaR disclosed in the supplement, and probably our empirical EaR is a little bit higher than our modeled EaR as a result of the relatively low – lower than modeled rates paid in Consumer. So when you put that together, all else equal, the drop in the weighted-average IORB, which is about 22 basis points, should produce a notable headwind in our Net Interest Income ex. Markets.\n",
      "Jamie Dimon (CEO): In the curve basically.\n",
      "Jeremy Barnum (CFO): Yeah. This is basically – that's just mechanically...\n",
      "Jamie Dimon (CEO): This is guaranteed not to happen.\n",
      "Jeremy Barnum (CFO): So that's mechanically just flowing through the curve. So yeah, your question is that given that, why are you not revising down? And the answer to that is that across all the puts and takes actually, our number is a tiny bit lower. It's just not enough to warrant a change in the outlook.\n",
      "But we do have some offsets. So we have some balance effects that are favorable. You will have noted that I talked about higher wholesale deposit balances, for example. We see beta outperforming in a couple of different places in CDs and in wholesale.\n",
      "The other thing is that you'll recall, we talked before about having a placeholder in our Net Interest Income outlook for the potential impact of the Card late fee rule. We've now removed that. So that's a little bit of an offset as well. So that's kind of how you get to unchanged, even though clearly, all else equal, the lower expected front-end rates are a headwind.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 1, Justification: The response is very direct and clear. The CFO directly addresses the impact of the updated interest rate curve (a headwind) and then provides specific, quantifiable offsets, such as favorable balance effects, outperforming betas, and the removal of the Card late fee rule placeholder, to explain why the Net Interest Income outlook remains unchanged.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "John McDonald (Analyst): Okay. Thanks, Jeremy. And then just as a follow-up, when we think about the investment spend agenda this year, how does it differ from, say, last year or last couple of years across lines of business in this kind of certainty of return spectrum you've talked about? And then what kind of efficiencies are baked into the outlook as well? Thanks.\n",
      "Jeremy Barnum (CFO): Sure. The truth is – and I guess this is a good thing that the themes are remarkably consistent. So, we are seeing the results of our kind of high certainty investment choices across all the categories that you know very well and that we highlighted on the outlook page for expenses, and those continue to be the main areas of focus. The execution gets tweaked at the margin as we pursue different opportunities in the Commercial & Investment Bank. We continue drilling down and analyzing into the relative pockets of weakness that you might see if you go a level or two below the very significantly strong share positions that you see on an aggregate level. Daniel always talked about the reds and the ambers that are behind the greens, and that's embedded in the culture of the company. So we do that everywhere and continue analyzing and iterating, and we throw resources against that stuff as we do that. But, broadly, the themes are very consistent.\n",
      "I think, in terms of efficiency, a couple of things to say, which you know well. One is, when we think about efficiency and how we generate it at this company, it's organic, it's BAU, it's evergreen; it happens every day in all the teams, everywhere. And so that is sort of part of the bottoms-up culture, and that remains the case.\n",
      "We do have a few top-down areas of focus. I think if I go, for example, into technology for starters, we're putting a lot of effort into improving the sort of ability of our software engineers to be productive as they do development, and there's been a lot of focus on that – the development environment for them, in order to enable them to be more productive. And so all else equal, that generates a little bit of efficiency. We also have a lot of focus on the efficiency of our hardware utilization. And so that's embedded in there as well.\n",
      "And another thing that's worth noting, you'll recall that, at Investor Day, I talked about how we had probably reached peak modernization spend. As Jamie always says, we're always modernizing. So, the fact that we've gotten to a peak and then it might come down a little bit from here still means we're going to be constantly modernizing. But, at the margin, that means that inside the tech teams, there's a little bit of capacity that gets freed up to focus on features and new product development and so on, which is also in some sense a form of efficiency.\n",
      "Finally, though, what I would say is that if you look at the head count trajectory of the company over the last few years, we have grown a lot and it has been for very good reasons. And it has contributed quite a bit to our growth and to our ability to run the company efficiently.\n",
      "But any time you have that quantum of headcount growth as well as that rate of headcount growth, you have to believe, all else equal, that some amount of inefficiency has been introduced. And so, this year, as we went through the budget cycle, we ask people, at the margin, to try to support the growth of the company while living within their means on the headcount front. So we're going to try to run things, with some important exceptions that I'll highlight in a second, on roughly flat head count and have that lead to people generating internal efficiencies as they get creative with their teams, and we consider more efficient ways of doing things. The obvious exceptions are the ongoing areas of high certainty investment and growth, so, obviously, branches and bankers and so on. And also, critical non-negotiable areas of risk and control like cyber or whatever independent risk management needs to ensure that we're running the company safely. So that's how we're thinking about efficiency in the current moment.\n",
      "John McDonald (Analyst): Very helpful. Thank you.\n",
      "Jamie Dimon (CEO): Efficiently said.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 2, Justification: The CFO directly states that investment themes are \"remarkably consistent\" rather than detailing differences, which addresses the first part of the question. For the second part, the response is very direct and specific, outlining various efficiency initiatives, including technology improvements, the impact of peak modernization spend, and a clear strategy for flat headcount to drive internal efficiencies. Overall, the answer mostly addresses the questions with good specificity on efficiencies.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Mike Mayo (Analyst): Hi. Simple and then more difficult, I guess. Jamie, who's your successor? And then the second question is, I know I asked the question at Investor Day, why not stay as CEO a little bit longer? I think what I'm hearing from investors now, it goes up and down, but I think investors would like you to stay. So, why say you're going to stay less than five years? You're finally getting what you wanted, 15 years, your spaghetti chart about the regulatory structure and the unpredictability of capital requirements and regulatory costs, and it seems like you're finally getting what you've been playing for. So, why not stay around a bit longer if investors want you to do so? And what would you do otherwise anyway? You don't play golf. You aren't going to be Treasury Secretary. Seems like your work is your hobby, right? So how much longer would you stay around?\n",
      "Jamie Dimon (CEO): I do love what I do. And answering the second question first, look, we're on a path. The path is not just about me, it's about the other senior people in the company. It's about the Board. If I'm here for several more years, and I may or may not be Chairman. That's going to be up to the Board. Does it really fit the new CEO and stuff like that? You're talking potentially four, five years or more. I'll be 69 in March. I think it's the rational thing to do. I've had a couple health problems, you know. I just think it makes a lot of sense, and so – and what was your first question again?\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 4, Justification: The CEO avoids the analyst's direct question about his successor by asking for it to be repeated at the end of his response, effectively deferring or ignoring it. While he offers some personal reasons (age, health) and vague corporate justifications for his tenure regarding the second question, he does not directly engage with the analyst's specific points about investor desire for him to stay longer or the recent regulatory environment, which indicates a degree of evasion.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Gerard Cassidy (Analyst): Very good. And then as a follow-up, circling back about the capital levels, you guys have been very clear about where you want them to be. Can you share the pros and cons from JPMorgan's perspective? Not so much from an investor, but we understand, of course, you can do a share repurchase. Obviously, you can do non-depository acquisitions with the excess capital. But what are the pros and cons of a special dividend to reduce that excess capital if you continue with these incredible profitability levels of 20% return on tangible common equity? You're growing your income and capital very nicely every year. But what are those pros and cons, again, from JPMorgan's perspective?\n",
      "Jeremy Barnum (CFO): Yeah. So, we made some public comments on this at a conference some time back. So he'll – he wants to go. So, go ahead.\n",
      "Jamie Dimon (CEO): No. No. Jeremy, go ahead.\n",
      "Jeremy Barnum (CFO): No, no, no. You go. Seriously.\n",
      "Jamie Dimon (CEO): I was just going to say we're not going to do one. We have looked at it. If you all have any great insights for us, let us know, but most people don't want it, doesn't add shareholder value. And I've never thought of having cash in your pocket as a bad thing. I think it's a huge mistake to look at life and you have to \"deploy capital\". So we want to be very, very patient. But special dividends, if you look at the history of special dividends, they really basically don't work.\n",
      "Jeremy Barnum (CFO): If anyone has a different opinion, we're always interested.\n",
      "Gerard Cassidy (Analyst): Sounds good. Thank you, gentlemen.\n",
      "Jeremy Barnum (CFO): Thanks, Gerard.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 1, Justification: The CEO directly addresses the question by stating they will not issue a special dividend and provides clear reasons from JPMorgan's perspective, including lack of shareholder value addition and historical ineffectiveness. He also implies the 'pros' of their current approach by emphasizing the value of patience and holding cash. The answer is specific and fully explains their stance.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Gerard Cassidy (Analyst): ...you mentioned in your comments about the overall Firmwide deposits have stabilized in the second half. You could see some growth and you're very – I think you said you started to see maybe some of that in the consumer checking deposits. We noticed in the industry data from the regulators, household checking deposits pre-pandemic for the industry were running about $1 trillion. Now, they have remained elevated post-pandemic at $4 trillion. Can you – based on what you're seeing in your customer base, what can you attribute the strength to in this consumer checking account deposits?\n",
      "Jeremy Barnum (CFO): That's fascinating, Gerard. I’ll have to take a look at that data. I don't actually recognize those numbers. But I can speak for ourselves, which is that when we look at the encouraging growth that we see in our checking franchise, it's a couple of things. So, of course, there was some excess, and there was some yield-seeking behavior. So you did see people moving money out of checking into higher-yielding alternatives over the course of the last couple of years in the rate cycle. It feels to us as if we're in the final innings of that. We're just not seeing nearly as much yield-seeking pressure as we had seen. In the meantime, as you well know, we are aggressively engaging with clients and acquiring all the new clients and deepening in a lot of different markets as part of our branch expansion strategy and the deepening in all of those markets.\n",
      "So the combination of the tail-end of the yield-seeking flows and excellent client engagement and success in the sort of organic build out of that franchise is starting to show up in checking account growth, which we see as a very healthy indicator for the franchise.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 1, Justification: The CFO provides clear and specific reasons for the growth in consumer checking deposits within their customer base, directly addressing the analyst's question. He attributes the strength to a decrease in yield-seeking outflows and successful client acquisition and branch expansion efforts.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Erika Najarian (Analyst): And just a follow-up question – a follow-up to John's line of questioning. As a placeholder, as we think about what you said, trying to arrest the growth of Common Equity Tier 1, for now, should we just assume that anything that you don't need for organic growth and your dividend obligations in terms of that 15.7% will be bought back by the company as we think about? I know you don't want to predict the buyback, but is that sort of just a placeholder for now as we think about what can return back to shareholders in the form of repurchase?\n",
      "Jeremy Barnum (CFO): Yeah. You've quoted our capital hierarchy, and your conclusion flows naturally from my statement that we do want to arrest the growth of the excess.\n",
      "Jamie Dimon (CEO): So, we are never going to tell the market what we're going to do. You all know that everybody is out there modeling these things, trading against these things. So, steady consistent buyers in the marketplace who are so predictable are making a mistake.\n",
      "Jeremy Barnum (CFO): Very good. We can go to the next question. Thanks. Yeah.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 4, Justification: While the CFO offers a somewhat indirect affirmation that the analyst's conclusion flows naturally, the CEO directly interjects to state that they will never predict capital actions like buybacks. This response explicitly avoids providing the requested 'placeholder' assumption for capital return, instead stating a general policy of non-disclosure regarding future buybacks.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Erika Najarian (Analyst): Yes. Good morning. This question is for Jamie. Jamie, you were on the media today talking about potential economic turbulence. But Jeremy also mentioned that banking should be – the banking system should be a source of strength in this turbulence. The equity market always seems to think about the banks as weaker players given how they trade the stocks more on sentiment and fear rather than the math of – the ability of banks to absorb provisions going forward, if we do fall into a slower economic downturn.\n",
      "So, I guess, just the question here is, can you double-click on how you think this is going to impact the economy going forward and maybe double-click on Jeremy's statement that the banking system should be a source of strength?\n",
      "Jeremy Barnum (CFO): I just – before Jamie answers that, Erika, I just want to make one brief comment, which is the banking system being a source of strength means what it says. In other words, banks doing their job to support the economy. That's not a statement about bank equity performance and the extent to which banks are cyclical or not. Like obviously, a recessionary environment, as I've frequently said, all else equal, is bad for banks from an equity performance perspective. We're talking about the financial strength of banks' balance sheets and our ability to support our clients in a difficult moment.\n",
      "Jamie Dimon (CEO): Everyone trades stocks in a different way, so sentiment – but banks are a cork in the ocean when it comes to the economy. If the economy gets worse, credit losses will go up, volumes can change, deal curves can change. And we're not predicting all of that.\n",
      "What I would say is our excellent economist, Michael Feroli, I called him this morning, specifically to ask him, how they're looking at their forecast today, they think it's about 50-50 for a recession. So I'll just refer to that. Obviously, if there's a recession, credit losses will go up and other factors will change, too.\n",
      "And I think the one thing I'll add to what Jeremy said is – and I don't usually pay that much attention to anecdotes, but this time I am. And I think you're going to see a lot of companies – you guys – not you, but the analyst community has already reduced its earnings estimates for the S&P by 5%. So it's – now it's up 5% as opposed to up 10%. My guess is that will be zero and negative 5%, probably in the next month.\n",
      "And then you're going to hear 1,000 companies report, and they're going to tell you what their guidance is. My guess is a lot will remove it. They're going to tell you what they think it might do to their customers, their base, their earnings, their cost, their tariffs. It's different for every company. But I assume you'll see that. And anecdotally, a lot of people are not doing things because of this. They're going to wait and see. And that's Mergers & Acquisitions, that's Mergers & Acquisitions with middle market companies, that's people's hiring plans and stuff like that. So people have to adjust to this new environment. And I think we'll see what it is.\n",
      "I just also want to point out, just to – so you can round it up. This is to make you feel comfortable, not uncomfortable. When COVID hit, unemployment went from like 4% to 15% in a couple of months, and we had to add to reserves in a two-month period of $15 billion. And then to show you how stupid Current Expected Credit Losses is, in the three month – three quarter period, we took down the $15 billion. So, just – that just sizes up a bad recession. If it's a mild recession, it will be less than that. If it's a really bad recession, it will be more than that. Either way, we can handle it and serve our clients. Earnings won't be great and the stocks will go down, which I look at as an opportunity to buy back more stock.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 1, Justification: The management's response is very direct and comprehensive. Jeremy Barnum clarifies the 'source of strength' statement, and Jamie Dimon thoroughly addresses the potential economic impact by referencing their economist's forecast, market indicators, and anecdotal evidence. They also explain how the banking system is prepared to handle various recessionary scenarios, directly answering both parts of the analyst's question without evasion.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Betsy L. Graseck (Analyst): Guys, can you hear me okay? All right. Just want to make sure you can hear me. So this has been a great call. First, congratulations on a great quarter. It's been a great call with a lot of robust questions here. You're like, what else is there to ask? Here's my question. As we think about the Net Interest Income outlook and you highlighted the Net Interest Margin pressure, but loan – but basically, balance is increasing here, right? Maybe you could just speak to – could you help me understand the order of the drivers? Is it QT going away, deposits going up, punch it into securities? Is it loan growth inflecting? Is there any place in the franchise where you see loan growth opportunities for inflection this coming year? And then lastly, as I think about your comments around you've got the green market share number one, you've got the yellow, you've got the red, places maybe we can't see. Could you help us understand where those yellows and reds are – where they are? Are they just scattered, everybody – every single business has one? Or are there some that have more than others and, therefore, more opportunities? And is it more balance sheet or fee-generative? That's kind of what I'd like to just discuss if you have a minute. Thanks.\n",
      "Jeremy Barnum (CFO): Sure. Yeah, let me take a crack at that, Betsy. So, loan growth, I think looking for areas where it might inflect, the only thing I can think of, frankly, that would be in that category, certainly in terms of being meaningful to the company's performance, would be acquisition finance because that's been relatively muted as a a function of the Mergers & Acquisitions environment, and if that picks up you could see more there. Now, those aren't loans that we necessarily keep on the balance sheet for that long, so whether that shows up in fees or Net Interest Income or whatever, it's a separate issue.\n",
      "But as you can see like on our presentation page for the Net Interest Income outlook, you know that Card loan growth and revolve normalization has been a significant tailwind. And while that is also a driver of growth in 2025, again, based on our current guess about the future, it will be – it's decelerating a little bit, rather than the opposite.\n",
      "Still growing above trend obviously, which is great, and it's a sign of the strength of the franchise and the amount of engagement that we're getting from our Card clients, but the big normalization tailwinds there are gone. You know well the state of the mortgage market given rates. Rates are also a headwind in some other pockets like our multifamily lending business at the margin. So, yeah, I think a higher growth environment, a little bit more optimism, could you see a bit more loan growth in Business Banking? Could you see a bit more growth in C&I at the margin? Yes. But I think the place where you might see inflection is more in the areas that are deal-driven, I would say. So, we'll see. We'll see what happens there.\n",
      "And in terms of the reds and the ambers under the green, I think you know them, right? And they're aligned with our big long-standing investment strategies. The biggest single one arguably is that in what you might call the affluent section of the Wealth Management space, we are significantly underpenetrated relative to the number of households that we bank in the country and our capabilities and our brand and what we think we bring to the table. So, that's why we're pushing so hard on that front, because I think we can get more share there and it completes the franchise very nicely. There are a bunch of examples elsewhere, but we talk a lot about drilling down inside the Markets business, inside Investment Banking and finding the places where even where at the aggregate global sector level we look great and any given region and any given subsector we can do better. And as I mentioned, we continue to look at that as aggressively as ever.\n",
      "Betsy L. Graseck (Analyst): Thank you.\n",
      "Jeremy Barnum (CFO): Thank you, Betsy.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 3, Justification: The CFO directly addressed the question about specific loan growth opportunities and provided examples for the 'yellow/red' strategic areas. However, he entirely omitted the first part of the question regarding the 'order of drivers' for Net Interest Income, such as the impact of QT, deposits, and securities. This significant omission means the answer only partially addresses the analyst's multi-part inquiry.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "John McDonald (Analyst): Hi, good morning. Jeremy, on that same topic, no change to the full year credit Card net charge-off forecast. How do we square that with the rising recession risk? Is it because you already have a couple of months of delinquencies kind of baked in the cake and this is more an issue for next year, or just too early to call?\n",
      "Jamie Dimon (CEO): We should have not given you that forecast. We don't know what the number is going to be. That's a...\n",
      "John McDonald (Analyst): Yeah.\n",
      "Jamie Dimon (CEO): I would say that's a short-term number, and based on what's happening today, there's a wide range of potential outcomes.\n",
      "John McDonald (Analyst): Yeah. Okay. Okay, yeah, that's what we were kind of thinking. And then...\n",
      "Jeremy Barnum (CFO): But, mechanically, John, though, as you alluded to, there are some mechanical elements to the way Card charge-off works that means that it's pretty baked pretty far ahead of time.\n",
      "Jamie Dimon (CEO): The next couple of quarters. Yeah.\n",
      "Jeremy Barnum (CFO): So, sort of echoing Jamie's point, it just doesn't necessarily tell you that much about what might actually happen through the end of the year. Even if unemployment were to increase significantly, it probably wouldn't flow through the charge-offs until later.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 2, Justification: The management directly addresses the analyst's hypothesis about credit card charge-offs being \"baked in\" and having a lag effect. While Jamie Dimon initially expresses uncertainty about the forecast, Jeremy Barnum provides a clear and specific explanation for why the full-year forecast might remain unchanged despite rising recession risks, confirming the analyst's understanding of the timeline.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Ken Usdin (Analyst): Good morning, Jeremy. Wondering if you could start by just kind of amplifying just the macro commentary that you started off on. And given the uncertainty in the world that you referenced, just how are you seeing the activity change across the customer base from consumers to wholesale? And can you just talk through how that's also just informing any changes in your – some of your growth and reserving expectations? Thanks.\n",
      "Jeremy Barnum (CFO): Sure, Ken. So I mean, at a high level, I would say that obviously, some of the salient news flow is quite recent. So, we've done some soundings and some checking both on the consumer side and on the wholesale side.\n",
      "I think on the consumer side, the thing to check is the spending data. And to be honest, the main thing that we see there, what would appear to be a certain amount of frontloading of spending ahead of people expecting price increases from tariffs. So ironically, that's actually somewhat supportive, all else equal. But I think what it sort of highlights is that during this transitional period and this elevated uncertainty, you might see some distortions in the data that make it hard to draw larger conclusions.\n",
      "In terms of our corporate clients, obviously, they've been reacting to the changes in tariff policy. And at the margin, that shifts their focus away from more strategic priorities with obvious implications for the Investment Banking pipeline outlook towards more short-term work, optimizing supply chains and trying to figure out how they're going to respond to the current environment.\n",
      "So as a result, I think we would characterize what we're hearing from our corporate clients as a little bit of a wait-and-see attitude.\n",
      "I do think you see obvious differences across sectors. Some sectors are going to be much more exposed than others and have more complicated problems to solve. And also across the size of the clients, I think smaller clients, small business and smaller corporates are probably a little bit more challenged. I think the larger corporates have a bit more experience dealing with these things and more resources to manage. So that's a little bit our read of the situation right now. But certainly, a bit of a wait-and-see attitude. It's hard to make long-term decisions right now, and so we'll see how that plays out.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 4, Justification: The CFO provides a detailed analysis of customer behavior and macro trends, effectively addressing the first two parts of the question. However, the response largely avoids the crucial third part concerning how these observations are informing changes in the firm's specific growth and reserving expectations, instead generally stating that it is \"hard to make long-term decisions right now.\" This is a deflection from providing concrete information about internal financial outlooks.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Ebrahim H. Poonawala (Analyst): And I guess – thanks for that. Just sticking with that, as far as QT is concerned, when you talk to experts, like no one knows where the right level for the Fed to end is. I'm just wondering if you have any thoughts there on when Fed should end the pressure on the system, and what it may imply for deposit growth?\n",
      "Jeremy Barnum (CFO): Yeah. I think the conventional wisdom on QT, and I'm not pretending to add to the conventional wisdom one way or the other, is that the tapering should sort of complete and, therefore, we might see an end sometime in the middle of the year. Of course, they may change that, but that seems to be the current market consensus. And when we sort of take a step back and look at the H.8 data and our kind of flow of funds models and that type of stuff, when you look at the way our peers are behaving, evolution of QT, expectations for economy-wide loan growth, et cetera, and what the impact of that might be on the growth of system-wide deposits, it's kind of consistent with the story that we're telling about sort of the background growth in our Net Interest Income outlook, plus or minus, what happens with the policy rate and stabilizing and growing deposit balances through the second half of the year.\n",
      "Ebrahim H. Poonawala (Analyst): Thank you.\n",
      "Gerard Cassidy (Analyst): Hi, Jeremy. Hi, Jamie. Jeremy...\n",
      "Jeremy Barnum (CFO): Good morning, Gerard.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 3, Justification: The CFO directly addresses the timing of Quantitative Tightening (QT) based on market consensus. However, the explanation for the implication of QT on deposit growth is verbose and generic, referring to various internal models and market data, but ultimately concluding it is 'consistent with the story that we're telling' about stabilizing deposits, rather than providing a specific, direct implication of QT's end.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Ebrahim H. Poonawala (Analyst): Good morning. I guess just two questions. In terms of areas of vulnerability, so I heard you, Jeremy, on the lending side, but lots of crosscurrents. Like, if we anchor to the fact that you have a new administration that's taking place or take office with a focus on domestic CapEx. Even if we don't get any rates cut, when you look through your customer base where do you see areas of vulnerability, be it because of tariffs, be it because of just lack of any additional relief from the Fed? Yeah, would love to hear just from a credit quality perspective what no rate cuts might mean.\n",
      "Jeremy Barnum (CFO): Oh, I see where your question is. That took me a second. Yeah, I mean, look, wholesale credit is pretty hard to predict. It tends to be very idiosyncratic. You obviously know that we're coming out of a 10-plus year period of an exceptionally low charge-off rate, and so at some point that has to normalize to a slightly more reasonable level, a little bit to Jamie's comments earlier about how some things are still not fully normalized, and arguably wholesale credit could be one of those. We do run extensive stress tests on the sensitivities to the portfolio – of the portfolio to rate shock. A lot of what we do from an underwriting perspective is designed to protect us from that, frankly. So, you can rest assured that we're running the relevant analysis, but I'm not inclined to go into detail on any given sector or whatever. Jamie, did you want to add?\n",
      "Jamie Dimon (CEO): I would just point the biggest driver of credit has been and always will be unemployment. That's both in the consumer side and it bleeds into the corporate side. It bleeds into mortgages, sub-prime, credit card. So, really, it's your forecast of unemployment, which you have to make your own, which will determine that over time. And so, the second thing you said, vulnerabilities, it's unemployment, but the worst case would be stagflation. Higher rates with higher unemployment will drive higher credit losses literally across the board. We're not predicting that, but you just asked where the vulnerability is, that's the vulnerability.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 4, Justification: The executives largely avoided providing specific areas of vulnerability within their customer base, as requested by the analyst. The CFO explicitly stated he was \"not inclined to go into detail on any given sector,\" while the CEO redirected the focus to broad macroeconomic factors like unemployment and stagflation rather than pinpointing specific portfolio segments at risk. This constitutes a clear evasion of the question's specific intent.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Matt O’Connor (Analyst): Good morning. Just wanted to drill down on the credit card spend. Any comments in terms of changing patterns on the consumer card spend? There's been headlines in travel kind of going down. Just talk about some of the puts and takes in that up 7% year-over-year.\n",
      "Jeremy Barnum (CFO): Yeah, it's a good question and we're seeing that too. So let me talk about travel. I mean we obviously saw the airlines discuss what they are seeing as headwinds for them, specifically in airline travel, and we're seeing that too through the card spend. It's not obvious to us that that's necessarily an indicator for broader patterns. There are a variety of potential explanations for the narrow drop in airline spend.\n",
      "And as I mentioned previously, another thing that we are seeing looking at the April data is what would appear to be a little bit of front-loading of spending, specifically in items that might be – have prices go up as a function of tariffs. So you see people behaving rationally, and I have noted even you hear anecdotes, and I've seen evidence of companies specifically advertising we have pre-tariff inventory and so on and so forth. So it's not that surprising that you're seeing that a little bit in the spending data.\n",
      "The other thing that people are kind of interested in this space is like what's happening by income band, because we have seen some of the retailers and other folks talking about weaknesses in the lower income segment. And I think when we look at our Card data and also our cash buffers and peoples' checking accounts, of course, it is true that it is relatively weaker in the lower income segment. But when you take a step back and you ask, are we seeing signs of distress in the lower income segment? The answer is no. So, sure, the margin and cash buffers are lower, and you see some rotation of spend and spending is a little bit weaker than it was in the peak spending moments. But actually, some of the increases in spending that we're seeing in April are actually coming from the lower income segment. So no evidence of distress, I would say.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 1, Justification: The CFO directly addresses the question about changing patterns in consumer card spending. They specifically discuss the observed weakness in travel spend, explain front-loading due to tariffs, and provide a detailed breakdown of spending patterns by income segment. The response offers concrete examples and insights, fully addressing the \"puts and takes\" within the 7% year-over-year increase.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Matt O'Connor (Analyst): Good morning. It seems like you guys have backed off the view that you're materially over-earning on net interest income. And is this all because of the higher rate environment that's expected now? Or is it also partly a different view on deposit pricing, specifically on the consumer side, which I think you had assumed it would reprice a bit more than we've seen?\n",
      "Jeremy Barnum (CFO): Yeah, it's a good question, Matt. I guess maybe let me try to frame this from a couple different perspectives. So, on the one hand, you're right. If you look at the Net Interest Income guidance that we're giving you, including the notion that subject to the yield curve panning out in line with the current forwards, which, as we know, is the one thing that we know won't happen. But if you want to assume something, if you assume the forwards, we're sort of telling you that we might return to sequential growth in the back half of the year, again, based on all of our current assumptions, all else being equal. And you could draw the conclusion that that means that the overearning narrative is no longer applicable.\n",
      "I think if you take a big step back, by historical standards, the difference between the policy rate and the weighted average rate paid on consumer deposits remains quite elevated for a variety of reasons and subject to the fact that in the end, deposit pricing is always going to be a response to the competitive environment that we experience in the field, the current structure of the yield curve is such that, for the time being anyway, when we do the math, that's what we see. Do we think that's truly, truly, truly sustainable through the cycle? Unclear. But I guess we'll cross that bridge when we come to it. For now, this is the outlook for the coming year.\n",
      "Jamie Dimon (CEO): And we've gotten closer to normalized Net Interest Income and normalized credit.\n",
      "Jeremy Barnum (CFO): Yeah. It is worth noting that Net Interest Income ex. Markets is down year-on-year. So there's some normalization there.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 4, Justification: The response acknowledges the shift in Net Interest Income guidance, but it becomes evasive when addressing whether a different view on consumer deposit pricing is a reason for this change. The CFO states it's \"unclear\" if current elevated deposit spreads are sustainable and defers the long-term view, avoiding a direct answer on whether their internal assumptions about future deposit repricing have changed as a contributing factor. This avoids fully addressing the second key part of the analyst's question.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Steven Chubak (Analyst): Thank you both for that perspective. And just for my follow-up, did want to ask on the Markets outlook. So, admittedly, less surprising to hear some of the cautious Investment Banking Return on Average Tangible Common Equity: Return on Average Tangible commentary in light of the uncertainty. But was hoping you could just speak to the Markets businesses which have been performing extraordinarily well of late and just given the combination of elevated volatility, but also some indications that clients are taking down risk, how you expect that business to perform over the coming quarters.\n",
      "Jeremy Barnum (CFO): Yeah. It's a good question. As you know, Steve, we're obviously not going to give Markets guidance. Your guess is as good as ours at some level. But the ingredients are the right ingredients. I mean, we've often discussed about how this business, all else equal, benefits from a volatile environment if markets are operating relatively normally, which they more or less have been. Of course, it's not guaranteed. We need to do a good job managing the risk. And yeah, there are states of the world where if our clients are struggling or deleveraging or taking down risk, that could be a headwind for us. So we're going to just do what we always do and try to manage the risk well and serve our clients, but we were certainly happy to see the performance this quarter.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 5, Justification: The CFO explicitly states they \"are not going to give Markets guidance\" and \"your guess is as good as ours,\" directly refusing to answer the analyst's question about how the Markets business is expected to perform in coming quarters. While they discuss general market factors, they provide no specific outlook or expectation regarding future performance, making the answer highly evasive.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Jim Mitchell (Analyst): Okay. Great. Thanks.\n",
      "Erika Najarian (Analyst): Yes. Hi, good morning. Wanted to follow up on the questions on capital and maybe ask about some of, Jeremy, the crosscurrents in terms of the denominator. So, if we look at the third quarter regulatory data for your Global Systemically Important Banks surcharge score, that would imply that your score would put you in a range of a 5% Global Systemically Important Banks. So, obviously, from what we understand, if you print that – somewhere near that score at the end of this year, then your Global Systemically Important Banks surcharge goes up by – to 5% or by 50 basis points two years and one day from now. At the same time, around the holidays, we did get the press release from both the Federal Reserve and the lawsuit from the banks. In terms of the transparency, it looks like the transparency is going to be focused on perhaps being improved as soon as this year's stress test.\n",
      "So, as we think about the definition of excess, right, because part of this is like 15.7% is clearly a huge number. So, as we think about your returns going forward, the definition of excess also continues to shift. So, how should we think about those crosscurrents in terms of two big components, clearly, one is your Global Systemically Important Banks surcharge and the other is your stress capital buffer?\n",
      "Jeremy Barnum (CFO): Right, Erika. Okay. You are tempting me with many rabbit holes that are very deep. But let's try and address this not too much great length. First of all, Global Systemically Important Banks. So, yes, it was a high print in the third quarter, but we had normal seasonality third quarter and fourth quarter. So, while our current view of Global Systemically Important Banks number is an estimate, we're quite confident that we wound up comfortably in the 5% bucket just as a result of normal seasonality. It was actually a relatively quiet December in terms of the types of year-end things that sometimes create pressures of various types. So that is more or less what you might have otherwise expected in terms of our typical seasonal patterns. So, not much to see there.\n",
      "And the obvious point also being that even under the existing proposed Global Systemically Important Banks rule, which is obviously a little bit hung up, with the smaller buckets and some of the recalibration and so on, it's not even sort of obvious that it would have mattered one way or the other. But, anyway, for now, we're managing to the current rules, and normal seasonality took us back under 5%. Okay, you mentioned the lawsuit. I think the only thing to say about that is that we are happy to see the clear recognition on the part of the Fed that many of the things that we've been talking about for a long time in terms of transparency and volatility, and some of the non-substantive bureaucratic burden associated with the Comprehensive Capital Analysis process needs improvement. So, that's great.\n",
      "I think I won't speak for the industry bodies that were the actual litigants, but it seems to me, if you just read what they said publicly in their press releases, this is as much as anything about preserving rights in light of the statute of limitations deadlines that were coming up. So, let's just hope that we see some significant progress on that front.\n",
      "And then, taking a step back, at a high level, what you're really asking me is, what is our core view about, and I think probably the best way to think about this is just through the lens of the numerator, actually. What is our core view about if you just, for the sake of argument, assume modest growth in the normalized amount of economic denominator, like actual need for capital organically, what will be the likely additional numerator that will be needed or not as a function of the environment.\n",
      "And the way we're increasingly thinking about that is just doing different scenario analysis of like flat numerator, up 5% numerator, up 10% numerator, up 20% numerator. I guess there could be some versions of the world where the numerator's a little less. And then guessing about our central case and comparing our projected capital amount to that number to determine the excess. And as you point out, at 15.7%, and I think the actual quantum of the numerator is something like $275 billion, through pretty much any reasonable lens, it's a ton of excess, which is why we've concluded that it doesn't need to grow anymore.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 4, Justification: While the CFO provided a direct answer regarding the GSIB surcharge remaining at 4%, he largely avoided the core of the question about how the 'crosscurrents' (including the stress capital buffer and transparency efforts) impact the 'definition of excess' capital. He re-framed the question to focus on the 'numerator' (amount of capital held) rather than the 'denominator' (capital need/requirements) and concluded they have a 'ton of excess,' effectively sidestepping a deeper discussion of the analytical impact of changing regulations on the definition of excess.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Matt O’Connor (Analyst): Okay. That's helpful color. And then just separately, if we look at the delinquencies for the Home Lending, the increase both quarter-on-quarter and year-over-year, is that just some of the noise from the First Republic deal as you take the marks upfront and then those portfolios essentially re-season from an accounting point of view? Or is there something else going on there?\n",
      "Jeremy Barnum (CFO): Sorry, the – I actually didn't hear. Which fees?\n",
      "Jamie Dimon (CEO): Delinquencies in Home Lending.\n",
      "Jeremy Barnum (CFO): I didn't – interesting. I haven't looked at that. We'll have to get back to you on that\n",
      "Jamie Dimon (CEO): I don't think it's anything...\n",
      "Jeremy Barnum (CFO): Whatever it is, it wasn't important enough to get raised, so.\n",
      "Jamie Dimon (CEO): It could be the First Republic accounting, yes\n",
      "Jeremy Barnum (CFO): Yeah. Anything is possible. We'll get back to you on that.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 5, Justification: The management explicitly stated they had not looked at the data regarding the delinquencies and could not answer the question directly, promising to get back to the analyst later. The CFO's comment that 'Whatever it is, it wasn't important enough to get raised' further dismisses the inquiry and avoids providing any relevant information about the cause of the increase at the moment.\n",

      "Ebrahim Poonawala (Analyst): Got it. Thank you so much.\n",
      "Jim Mitchell (Analyst): Hey, good morning. Jeremy, just on – with four – three to four cuts sort of mostly in the back half, June to December, how do you think about the trajectory of Net Interest Income this year? Is there a little more pressure towards the end of the year into 2026? Just trying to think of that around that trajectory and jumping off point into next year.\n",
      "Jeremy Barnum (CFO): Yes. It's funny, Jim, because I was asked on the press call, how come we're not like suspending guidance or whatever? And my answer was like...\n",
      "Jim Mitchell (Analyst): Right.\n",
      "Jeremy Barnum (CFO): ...well, whatever. We give guidance and we do our best, and it's contingent on a variety of external variables, and we always make our guidance contingent on that. So in that context...\n",
      "Jamie Dimon (CEO): and the yield curve you're using...\n",
      "Jeremy Barnum (CFO): Yeah, yeah, yeah.\n",
      "Jamie Dimon (CEO): ...which we know will not happen.\n",
      "Jeremy Barnum (CFO): Yeah. And the particular nuance, as you'll recall from last quarter, where we went into some detail about the various drivers of the Net Interest Income outlook, including a little bit of a suggestion about the quarterly trajectory is that it's both the timing of rates and the – our expected evolution of deposit growth in the different businesses and how card revolve and how that was all going to interact, producing a potential trough in different moments and then so on and so forth.\n",
      "I think that given everything that's going on on that one, probably we'll wait for next quarter to give you any more color on that. Certainly, the back-loaded cuts, all else equal, from a run-rate perspective, introduced a little bit of a headwind on an exit rate going into next year. We'll just have to see how the balances play out through the next three quarters.\n",
      "Jim Mitchell (Analyst): Right. And maybe just to...\n",
      "Jamie Dimon (CEO): It will not happen that way, and we have a lot of options in what we want to do to change our exposure to interest rate.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 5, Justification: The management explicitly stated they would 'wait for next quarter to give you any more color' on the Net Interest Income trajectory. This is a direct refusal to provide the requested information about the NII trajectory and its implications for the end of the year and into 2026, making the answer very evasive.\n",

      "Betsy L. Graseck (Analyst): Okay. Thank you.\n",
      "Jeremy Barnum (CFO): Thanks\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 1, Justification: The CFO directly addresses the implied question about the functioning of money markets and Fed funds, stating they are \"functioning quite smoothly.\" The answer is clear and specific, directly responding to the topic initiated by the analyst without vagueness or redirection.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "John McDonald (Analyst): Okay. Got it. And then just on capital, how does this type of macro uncertainty impact your thinking around conserving capital as opposed to deploying it through your investment agenda and buybacks as the stock gets cheaper? Or just, are you still looking to arrest the increase or does this kind of change it?\n",
      "Jamie Dimon (CEO): The investment that we do in banks, branches, technology, Artificial Intelligence is going to continue regardless of the environment. And then we have – depending what happens to Basel III and Comprehensive Capital Analysis and G-SIFI and all that, $30 billion to $60 billion of excess capital. And in the Chairman's letter, I wrote about what we think of that. But based upon the environment, the turbulence issues, I like having excess capital. We are prepared for any environment. And that's so we can serve clients. That's not for any other reason. So, we have plenty of capital and plenty of liquidity to get through whatever the stormy seas are.\n",
      "John McDonald (Analyst): Okay. Thank you.\n",
      "Jeremy Barnum (CFO): Thanks John.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 4, Justification: The CEO directly addresses the commitment to continuing investments but largely avoids the specific query about how macro uncertainty impacts the deployment of capital through buybacks. Instead, he provides general statements about the preference for holding excess capital for preparedness and refers to a previous chairman's letter for detailed thinking, sidestepping a direct answer on capital deployment strategy for buybacks.\n",

      "Steven Chubak (Analyst): Hi. Good morning and thanks for taking my questions. Wanted to start off with one on the proposed SLR changes and just the impact of rate volatility. The Treasury is committed to providing relief to the banks under the SLR just to help mitigate some of the volatility in the 10-year. But given the geopolitical concerns, weakening global demand for treasuries, how does it inform your appetite just for purchasing U.S. Treasuries if those reforms are implemented and just how you're managing rate risk maybe more holistically across the Firm, just in light of some the recent volatility?\n",
      "Jamie Dimon (CEO): Yes. So SLR alone isn't going to change that much for us. It may change for other people. We really need reform across SLR, G-SIFI, Comprehensive Capital Analysis, Basel III and Liquidity Coverage Ratio Market., all of which have deep flaws in them to make a material change.\n",
      "And remember, it's not relief to the banks; it's relief to the markets. JPMorgan will be fine with/without an SLR change. The reason to change some of these things is so banks – the big market makers could intermediate more in the markets. If they don't – if they do, spreads will come in, there'll be more active traders. If they don't, the Fed will have to intermediate, which I think is just a bad policy idea that every time there's a kerfuffle in the markets, the Fed has to come in and intermediate. So they should make these changes.\n",
      "The point – the reason why is when you have very – a lot of volatile markets and very wide spreads and low liquidity in treasuries, it affects all other capital markets. That's the reason to do it; not as a favor to the banks themselves. And we don't take more interest rate exposure to this in any way, shape or form. So it's not like we're going to change our position. We intermediate in the markets to help clients do what they have to do. And if the banks could take bigger positions, they would have just larger dealer positions and take no – basically take not much more interest rate exposure. I should say that our folks did a fabulous job trading this quarter.\n",
      "Jeremy Barnum (CFO): And Steve, all I would add to that is that it is, of course, true, and we all remember the moment a few years ago when intermediaries were, in fact, bound by SLR as a result of the expansion of the deposit base, and extraordinary actions needed to be taken to address that. So we've seen when it is binding, and it works not as designed, which is why we do very much agree that it should be fixed.\n",
      "I think our point is a little bit, as Jamie said in his Chairman's letter, that it's not the only thing that needs to be fixed, and there are interactions among all these things. And we, as a bank, are not particularly bound by it.\n",
      "There is some interesting nuance too in terms of the potential TLAC issuance impact there, which is quite sensitive to which particular fix gets put in. So that will be an interesting thing to watch.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 2, Justification: The CEO directly addresses the core question by stating that JPM will not change its position or take on more interest rate exposure due to proposed SLR changes. However, a significant portion of the answer broadens the discussion to advocate for wider regulatory reform and the general market benefits of SLR changes, which, while related, slightly deflects from a focused answer on the firm's specific treasury appetite and risk management strategies.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Gerard Cassidy (Analyst): Very good. Thank you. And then as a follow-up, you both just talked about the potential changes to the different regulatory outcomes for you and your peers, whether it's SLR or the Global Systemically Important Banks buffer, et cetera. Can you opine for us your views? Are you more confident with the new administration, the new personnel, whether it's Treasury Secretary Bessent or others, the nominees for different regulatory heads that there will be a better chance of real regulatory reform, they see it the way you guys do versus the prior administration?\n",
      "Jeremy Barnum (CFO): Yeah, I mean, Gerard, we always say this, and it's true, which is that we work with all administrations and every administration as constructively as possible to express our opinions and advocate for the things that we think are right for the banking system and for the economy as a whole, and that was true before, and it's true now with this administration as well.\n",
      "Clearly, the administration has been quite vocal about wanting more pro-growth policies at the margin and for wanting to make it easier for banks to participate more constructively in the economy. And as we see the various folks and the various agencies go through the confirmation process, it will be helpful to have people in seats and get to work on some of the things that we want to get done. So let's see how that plays out, but we're looking forward to continuing to engage constructively.\n",
      "Jamie Dimon (CEO): Yeah. I think there's a deep recognition of the flaws in the system, and there should be, and fortunately, they're going to take a good look at it.\n",
      "Gerard Cassidy (Analyst): Very good. Thank you.\n",
      "Jeremy Barnum (CFO): Thanks, Gerard.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 4, Justification: The executives provide general statements about working with all administrations and the new administration's stated pro-growth intentions. However, they explicitly avoid directly addressing whether they are \"more confident\" with the new administration compared to the prior one regarding regulatory reform. They defer a direct answer by stating \"let's see how that plays out\" rather than offering a clear stance on increased confidence or a comparison.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Steven Chubak (Analyst): That's great. Thank you both for taking my questions.\n",
      "Gerard Cassidy (Analyst): Thank you. Hi, Jeremy and Jamie. Can you guys share with us – if you take a look at the non-traditional lenders, private credit lenders, they've been very active in grabbing market share from the traditional commercial banks over the last two or three years, particularly since the initial Basel III Endgame proposal came out in July of 2023, which is no longer applicable. But are you guys seeing any opportunities where customers may re-intermediate back into the banks like your bank because of this volatility?\n",
      "Jeremy Barnum (CFO): I mean that's hard to tell, Gerard. I think it's too early to tell. But what I would say is that it kind of – your question aligns with what we've been saying about this space for some time, which is we want to be product agnostic here and give our clients the best option that makes sense for them in the moment. Whether that's a traditional syndicated lending facility or something that looks more like a unitranche, direct lending type structure, we're open for business for all of it.\n",
      "And I would say that when we talk about the financial system being a source – the banking system being a source of strength in this environment, part of what we're talking about is our commitment and willingness to lend through cycles, as we've always done in the past and that we have the underwriting capability and the capital and the liquidity and the experience to be reliable lenders in serving our clients no matter what type of environment we're in. So, if that means that we have an opportunity to compete incrementally even more effectively in this environment, that will be great.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 3, Justification: The CFO initially states it's \"too early to tell\" regarding customers re-intermediating, which is a direct but limited response. However, the bulk of the answer then pivots to general statements about the bank's product agnostic approach and the overall strength of the banking system, rather than providing further specific insights or observations on the potential for customers to move back from non-traditional lenders.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Betsy L. Graseck (Analyst): Jamie, you've been through many cycles. And I think we're all interested in understanding how you think this next cycle is likely to progress. And I'm wondering, is there anything that you've seen in the past that looks like this, or that you would suggest if any slowdown coming forward, is it more likely to be similar to what kind of prior cycle you've seen?\n",
      "Jamie Dimon (CEO): An almost impossible answer. We look at all the cycles. And you know we prepare for a full range of outcomes. We're not – I don't personally like predicting what the future is going to hold. But I do – I've pointed out over and over, there's a lot of issues out there. I think some of those issues, you are going to see them resolve, for better or for worse, in the next four months.\n",
      "So maybe when we're doing this call next quarter, we won't have to be guessing. We'll actually know what the effect of some of these things was with some predictability and stuff like that. But it's – the result in a bank is almost always the same, which is volatile markets, credit losses go up, people get more conservative, investments go down, what looks like a recession. Is it mild or hard? I don't know and – but we are – I've been quite cautious, and you can see in our capital, our liquidity, our position, our balance sheet. And so we're prepared. But we do all that so we can serve our clients through thick or thin. We're not guessing about what the future is going to hold. Obviously, if you look at our numbers, we have the margins and capability to get through just about anything.\n",
      "But Betsy, this is different, okay? This is different. This is the global economy, and please read my Chairman's Letter. The most important thing to me is the Western world stays together economically when we get through all this and militarily to keep the world safe and free for democracy. That is the most important thing. I really almost don't care fundamentally about what the economy does in the next two quarters. That isn't that important. We'll get through that. We've had recessions before and all that. It's the ultimate outcome. What's the goal? How can we get there? And it's literally that. I mean – and the China issue is a major issue. I don't know how that's going to turn out. We obviously have to follow the law of the land, but it's a significant change that we've never seen in our lives.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 5, Justification: The CEO explicitly stated he doesn't like predicting the future and deemed the question 'almost impossible' to answer. He then completely pivoted the discussion from economic cycle comparisons to geopolitical concerns, dismissing the importance of the economy's performance in the short term. This response clearly avoided the core of the analyst's question about the nature and progression of the next economic cycle relative to past ones.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Mike Mayo (Analyst): One short follow-up. Just first quarter, you mentioned good credit, good trading, good Earnings per Share beat. I'm not sure anyone cares. They're worried more about the things we're talking about here. But in terms of the risk of being an international company, an international U.S. company during trade wars. And I know JPMorgan is a firm that likes to partner with countries as well as communities and customers. So how do you think about that risk? How should we think about that risk? And hopefully, your voice is being heard to speed things along to whatever can be done, getting it done because you could be in the crosshairs at some point.\n",
      "Jamie Dimon (CEO): Yeah. I honestly add that to the list of worries. We will be in the crosshairs. That's what's going to happen. And it's okay. We're deeply embedded in these other countries, people like us. But I do think some clients or some countries will feel differently about American banks, and we'll just have to deal with that.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 2, Justification: Jamie Dimon directly acknowledges the analyst's concern about being in the 'crosshairs' during trade wars, stating they 'will be in the crosshairs' and will 'have to deal with that'. While he confirms the risk and its potential impact, he offers no specific strategies or detailed plans on how they will 'deal with that', leading to a minor vagueness in the solution aspect of the answer.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Ebrahim Poonawala (Analyst): Thank you. Good morning. I guess just wanted to follow up on the macro uncertainty. I think when you talk to investors, we've gone from enthusiasm for a pro-business administration to a lot of headwinds. And I think Jamie mentioned you'll have companies take down guidance, et cetera, potentially over the coming weeks. I'm just wondering what is it you think we need to see before this uncertainty abates, or the 90-day pause that we saw with some of the other countries on tariffs. Is that enough? Or I'm just wondering when you talk to clients, corporate CEOs, what are they looking for from the administration that would inject confidence to get back anywhere close to where we were maybe 60 or 90 days ago?\n",
      "Jamie Dimon (CEO): First of all, some of all the issues that are raised existed before the new administration, like the geopolitical situation, the excess fiscal deficits, poorly done regulations and all that. Obviously, pro-growth is good, pro-business is good, pro-dereg is good. I think the best thing to do is to allow the Secretary of Treasury and the folks working with him and the administration to finish as quick as possible the agreements that they need to make with – around tariffs and with our trading partners. And I think there'll be agreements in principle. They're not going to be – trade agreements themselves would be 5,000 or 10,000 pages long. And that's the best way to go about it right now. That does not mean you won't have some of the effects take place anyway.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 4, Justification: The CEO largely avoids directly stating what corporate CEOs are looking for to inject confidence, instead offering a general recommendation for the administration to finalize trade agreements. While he touches on tariffs, the response lacks the specific conditions or client-centric insights requested to truly abate uncertainty.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Ebrahim Poonawala (Analyst): Got it. I guess as a follow up, I think there's a lot of concern also in the treasury markets. We've seen the 10-year move from 3.99% to 4.50% in a matter of a week. Just your comfort level on terms of the functioning of the treasury market. Do you see the Fed stepping in, pausing QT, maybe even initiating some treasury purchases? Just any color would be great.\n",
      "Jamie Dimon (CEO): Yeah. But again, I mean, we have sticky inflation. We had that before. I personally have told you all, I don't think that's going to go away, and that relates to that. Obviously, the U.S. dollar still is the reserve currency, and that isn't going to change, though some people may feel slightly differently about it.\n",
      "And the Fed – we've been inconsistent. There will be a kerfuffle of the treasury markets because of all the rules and regulations. I've told you that consistently. It happened in COVID, it happened before, it happened. That will happen. And then when that happens, the Fed will step in. That's what happens. And they're not going to do it now because you don't have all those issues yet. They'll do it when they start to panic a little bit, and we don't know if and when that's going to happen, and we'll see.\n",
      "But the notion that the 10-year Treasury has to go down is a false notion. If we look at history in prior times, when we have huge global deficits. Back in the '70s, in the '60s, the guns and butter. And tariffs, at least our economists think will be inflationary to 0.5% or something like that. So we'll have to wait and see and deal with it.\n",
      "Ebrahim Poonawala (Analyst): Thank you.\n",
      "Jamie Dimon (CEO): For most – mostly haven't dealt with this stuff before, and you're going to see a lot of stuff taking place shortly in the next couple of months, and then we'll know.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 4, Justification: The CEO largely avoids directly answering the analyst's specific questions. He does not explicitly state his comfort level on the current functioning of the treasury market, nor does he specify whether the Fed will pause QT or initiate treasury purchases. Instead, the response offers general macroeconomic commentary, conditional statements about future Fed intervention, and historical context, without providing concrete answers to the core questions.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Jim Mitchell (Analyst): Right. And maybe just on that point on volumes and deposits, obviously, this kind of volatility tends to drive – as corporates and investors go to cash, tends to drive higher deposits. Did you see that trend in March and particularly in April? What are the trends like in the deposit side of the equation?\n",
      "Jeremy Barnum (CFO): It’s a little hard to tell, to be honest. It is true that wholesale deposits this quarter outperformed for us relative to our expectations. I don't think I can say with any confidence that that's a result of the environment that we're in. So I think next quarter will probably be a better time to assess that.\n",
      "Jamie Dimon (CEO): I'll just – I'll say it may not be deposits. It may be treasury bills or various other things. And what you've seen which is different, it's not the risk off trade in the 10-year. That is fundamentally different this time.\n",
      "Jim Mitchell (Analyst): Right. Okay. Thanks for taking my questions.\n",
      "Jeremy Barnum (CFO): Thanks.\n",
      "Betsy L. Graseck (Analyst): Thanks. Good morning, Jamie. Good morning, Jeremy. Two questions. One for Jamie, just to kick off.\n",
      "Jamie Dimon (CEO): Good morning.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 4, Justification: The CFO states it's 'hard to tell' regarding the deposit trends in March and April, and defers a confident assessment to the next quarter, avoiding a direct answer. The CEO further redirects by suggesting it 'may not be deposits' but other asset classes, thus not addressing the specific question about deposit trends.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Mike Mayo (Analyst): Hey, Jamie, you just said on this call, there's a \"Deep recognition of flaws\" by the new regulatory regime. And can you put – you or Jeremy, put some meat on the bones as far as what's been an ideal scenario? You keep the safety and soundness of the system, but you rid all – as much red tape and bureaucracy as possible. How much could expenses potentially decline? I assume you pass on some of that to customers and you'd keep some of that, and the regulators would save money. So, some meat on the bones about the potential concrete savings from deregulation.\n",
      "But before that, the negative, which you highlight in the press release and the Chairman Letter about trade wars, Jamie, you went from trade wars \"Get over it\" to this week say, \"Do something.\" So just as far as the tariff journey, what were you initially expecting to what happened and do you really think next earnings call we'll be through most of the uncertainty? Thanks.\n",
      "Jamie Dimon (CEO): Yeah. No, I don't think we'll necessarily be through all the uncertainty. I think you'll just know a lot more. And my quote was about, get over it. I wish I hadn't said it. I was specifically referring to tariffs relating to protecting national security. National security is paramount. All things should be subordinated to it. You may need tariffs to help fix some of the problems related to national security. National security is a small part of trade, so – and it's rare earths, penicillin, medical ingredients, certain types of – obviously, you've heard about semiconductors. That was my quote about, get over it. I did not change my view about it.\n",
      "I would like to see the administration negotiate trade deals. I think they'll be good for everybody, and they want to do it too. They've said they want to do it. They've said they're having conversations with 70, 80 different people. And so I do think if the regulators change regulations, it will free up capital and liquidity to finance the system. And I don't – I wouldn't expect an expense drawdown that you're going to see. There will be thousands – hundreds of people, maybe, but it's not going to be passed on. But it will reduce net-net the cost of liquidity and the cost of loans and the cost of mortgages, if it's done right.\n",
      "I specifically pointed out the mortgage issue in my Chairman's letter this year about if they do some of these reforms, the cost of mortgages would come down 70 basis points. If I were them, I'd be focusing on that right now.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 2, Justification: The CEO directly addresses both parts of the question. He clarifies his past 'get over it' quote and provides a direct answer regarding future trade war uncertainty. For deregulation, he states he doesn't expect a large expense drawdown for the bank but details potential systemic savings, even offering a concrete example of 70 basis points for mortgage costs. While he reframes the expense part of the deregulation question from internal bank costs to system-wide benefits, the answer is still mostly direct and informative.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Mike Mayo (Analyst): No, and you also mentioned hundreds of billions of dollars of extra lending if you reduce the Common Equity Tier 1 ratio, I guess, back down by one-fifth.\n",
      "Jamie Dimon (CEO): If you do all – you have to fix Liquidity Coverage Ratio Market., G-SIFI, Comprehensive Capital Analysis, SLR, and I think would free up hundreds of billions of dollars for JPMorgan annually of various types of lending to the system. Some would be markets, some would be middle market loans, et cetera. And I pointed out, if you wanted to look at the big numbers, that loans to deposits are now 70% for the banking system writ large. That used to be 100%, and the reason for that isn't – it's not just capital. It is also Liquidity Coverage Ratio Market., it is also G-SIFI, also – and the question you should ask because you are very smart, Mike, is could you have the same – and I believe you have a safer system, lend more money, have more liquidity, eliminate bank runs, eliminate what happened to First Republic and Silicon Valley, and you could accomplish all of that with completely rational and thoughtful regulations. That's what I would like to see them do. I don't know what's going to happen. We're going to...\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 3, Justification: The CEO confirms the premise of freeing up hundreds of billions but then broadens the discussion from the specific Common Equity Tier 1 ratio reduction to a wider array of regulations and a general advocacy for regulatory reform. While acknowledging the potential outcome, the answer doesn't directly address the implied question about the specific mechanism mentioned by the analyst, making it somewhat vague on the core point and partially redirecting to a broader policy stance.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Erika Najarian (Analyst): Got it. And a second follow-up question. And I don't disagree with you guys on equity market performance of bank stocks. It's just that the mindset of portfolio managers is they always go back to sort of the lowest common denominator of fundamental performance versus thinking about resilience.\n",
      "And to that point, the second question is on the reserve. Jeremy, you mentioned a weighted-average unemployment rate of 5.8%. I think that's above where economists are thinking we could peak even in a recession scenario. How should we think about any incremental builds from here? And what you are going – obviously, deterioration in the outlook, but what more do you need to see in terms of how you make decisions about further builds from here?\n",
      "Jeremy Barnum (CFO): Yeah, Erika, it's a good question. But the truth is there's just a little bit too much uncertainty right now for me to sort of give an outlook for reserves, which is generally not a thing that we do anyway.\n",
      "As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, the [indiscernible] forecast at the end of the quarter was the sort of bog standard, no landing, barely any increase in unemployment. Given that we knew at the time that there was – there were some big pending announcements, and there was quite a bit of elevated uncertainty around that, it felt like the forecasts were kind of lagging because people were just waiting to actually get the information and so it felt appropriate to add a little bit of downside skew to our probability assessment, which is what led to the increase and what led to the build.\n",
      "We use this weighted-average unemployment thing as a useful way to help explain what's going on inside the reserve. But obviously, the actual mechanisms are quite complex, the depth in any financial recession, the timing of it, distribution of outcomes, which sectors have hits, idiosyncratic stuff in wholesale. There's a lot.\n",
      "I think on consumer, as Jamie mentioned, it is worth remembering that by far the most important variable is unemployment. So if the labor market remains very strong, consumer credit will probably be fine. If it doesn't, then you're going to see it play through the way it always does.\n",
      "Erika Najarian (Analyst): Thank you.\n",
      "Jeremy Barnum (CFO): Thanks, Erika.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 4, Justification: The CFO directly states that an outlook on reserves cannot be provided due to uncertainty and general company policy. However, when asked what more the company needs to see for future builds, the answer avoids specific internal decision-making criteria or triggers, instead emphasizing the complexity of the models and general economic factors.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Mike Mayo (Analyst): One short...\n",
      "Jamie Dimon (CEO): You can read our – I think our NPRs are public and stuff like that. And so they should do that. Just make a better system. Or you have the best in the world. We've kind of started to cripple it slowly. If you don't – I'd say, you look at these rules and regulations. See Europe. If that's where we want to go. Let's just go there.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 5, Justification: The CEO's response is highly general and argumentative, immediately pivoting from a brief mention of \"public NPRs\" to a broad critique of the regulatory system. It completely avoids providing any specific financial, operational, or company-specific information relevant to an analyst's likely question, thus changing the topic entirely.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Mike Mayo (Analyst): All right. Thank you.\n",
      "Glenn Schorr (Analyst): Hi. Just one follow-up on this whole risk management/regulatory front. I see, I hear and I agree: flawed regulatory system, could be better. We've had massive volatility. The market plumbing has held in okay so far and you and others have had borderline spectacular trading results. So, has something changed? Are the systems better? Are they better able to handle your risk management, your people, the diversity of your platform better? Or are there still environments where not all volatility is good? Just curious to get your big picture thoughts. Thanks.\n",
      "Jeremy Barnum (CFO): I mean, maybe I'll start with that one, Glenn. So, I guess, I think that your points aren't mutually exclusive. Meaning, I mean, we're always continually improving the franchise. We've talked a lot about inward investment in all of our businesses, including Markets. And so we try to be more complete and invest in technology and work more closely with our clients. So I'm sure we're kind of better at it than we were five years ago, as I think probably everyone is at the margin. I'm not sure that you can associate that with the current performance. I think these just happen to be very favorable conditions that we've managed very successfully.\n",
      "And to your point, I think your specific question of like is there – are there still forms of volatility that can be bad for the Markets franchise? The answer to that question is definitely yes. When you have gappy volatility with no trading volume, people paralyzed, clients unsure what to do, active managers struggling, those environments are bad. So people make fun of the kind of good volatility, bad volatility story, but whether we like it or not, it's real. And in the end, we just have to manage the risks and serve the clients. And as I said earlier, we're happy to see that...\n",
      "Jamie Dimon (CEO): Jeremy – I agree. Jeremy, I would add to that. Volatility leads to bigger bid-ask spreads, that, all things being equal, is better. And it leads sometimes to higher volumes. So you've seen really high volumes in Foreign Exchange and interest rate swaps, a whole bunch of different things, treasuries. That's better. But as Jeremy pointed out, sometimes that kind of volatility leads to very low volumes, like you see in Debt Capital Markets today when you don't have these bond deals where you have less trading, when you have – so it will have lower volumes in certain markets and stuff like that. And how it all filters through is almost impossible to tell. But our folks do a great job and we're here to help our clients. So we know that volumes can go up or down and spreads can go up or down.\n",
      "But the plumbing of the system, I would say the plumbing worked well during COVID too. I mean, it wasn't the plumbing that was a problem and wasn't even a problem to go back to some of the real crises we've had, so – but you should always worry about that kind of thing, make sure it stays true.\n",
      "Jeremy Barnum (CFO): And I do think that the fact that the revenue performance in this quarter is good shouldn't make us lose focus on the importance of the larger fixes around financial resource deployment by regulated banks to supporting the capital markets ecosystem. Everything Jamie's been talking about SLR, Liquidity Coverage Ratio Market., ILST, Global Systemically Important Banks, Basel III Endgame, Risk-Weighted Assets, the whole panoply of items, which interacts, as we've often talked about and is miss-calibrated, it will, at the margin, make it harder for banks to serve a stabilizing function in a difficult moment. So that remains quite important as a policy priority.\n",
      "Glenn Schorr (Analyst): That's a great point. Thanks for that. Appreciate it.\n",
      "Jeremy Barnum (CFO): Thanks, Glenn.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 2, Justification: The management directly answers whether different types of volatility exist and confirms that 'bad' volatility still poses risks. They also acknowledge continuous internal improvements while attributing current strong performance more to favorable market conditions. While there's a slight redirection to broader regulatory issues at the end, the core of the analyst's questions about systems, risk management, and the nature of volatility is mostly addressed.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Betsy L. Graseck (Analyst): Excellent. Okay. No, thank you for that. And then...\n",
      "Okay. Thank you so much for that. And yes, looking forward to the next four months and clarity coming. So then one for Jeremy. Question on the wholesale loans. I'm going into this because I noticed your average loan growth, I think it was running at about 2% year-on-year. And then end of period loans was up 5% and wholesale loans was up 7%. So I'm just wondering if there was some line drawdowns at quarter end. And it's a broader question on just liquidity. Do you see your customers looking for more liquidity? Are they drawing down lines? And maybe if you could speak to liquidity in the front end of the market, that would be helpful, too. Thank you.\n",
      "Jeremy Barnum (CFO): Yeah, it's a good question, Betsy. So a couple of things. One is in our soundings of our wholesale clients during sort of the moments of peak uncertainty, we did hear them talking about wanting to focus on shoring up liquidity. Interestingly, I actually asked the question like a day ago, whether we were seeing draws, meaningfully observable draws from clients. And the answer to that question was no, at least not yet. So, I don't know what to make of that, but perhaps it suggests that we do not see that level of heightened anxiety that people are more just focusing on addressing their supply chain issues right now. Yeah. So on wholesale loans.\n",
      "Beyond that, I don't think there's that much of a story. Now we're seeing a bit more growth in sort of like Markets loans as opposed to traditional C&I loans in the current moment, but that's neither here nor there. Did you have – yeah, you asked – what did you ask also, front end of the yield curve, liquidity?\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 3, Justification: The CFO directly answers whether clients are currently drawing down lines and if they are looking for more liquidity. However, he is vague regarding the specific wholesale loan growth discrepancy, dismissing it by saying 'Beyond that, I don't think there's that much of a story.' He also completely misses the question about liquidity in the front end of the market, needing to be prompted for it again.\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "Saul Martinez (Analyst): Okay. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Most of my questions have been asked and answered, but I guess I'll ask about costs since nobody has asked it. But I guess how should we think about the cost structure and any sort of cost optimization efforts, if you do see a revenue slowdown, but not necessarily a severe downturn? I think you do have, in the $95 billion guidance, you do have a good amount of growth penciled in for investing in bankers and branches and tech and marketing. And I guess, do you – does it make sense or under what conditions would it make sense for you to maybe pull back on some of these investments? Or do you think that's just completely shortsighted unless we see a real significant downturn in the economy.\n",
      "Jeremy Barnum (CFO): Yeah. So you've slightly answered your own question there, Saul, but it is nonetheless a good question. So let me unpack it a little bit. So the way I think about it is there are some elements of the expense base which automatically reset as a function of the business environment. So we talk about those as volume- and revenue-related expenses. So you will see those come down as a function of the environment.\n",
      "It's also true that there are conceivably certain investment business cases, which depending on how the environment changes, could no longer make sense analyzed in the same way that we analyze them originally, i.e., through the lens of their ability to generate long-term shareholder value through a long investment cycle. And so if for whatever reason the environment changes in such a way as to make certain of those investments less compelling, we would obviously adjust.\n",
      "Of course, the thing that we're not going to do is stop investing in things that we still think are very compelling to our traditional long-term investment lens, simply for the purposes of achieving a cosmetic reduction in expenses in an environment where you may or may not have a reduction in revenues for unrelated reasons. As you well know, that's just not how we run the company.\n",
      "This quarter, as it happens, a question you might have is how are you managing to keep your guidance the same with what you're saying about, for example, the Investment Banking outlook? But it's worth noting that Investment Banking performance this quarter was actually fine. As you know, Markets performance was very strong. And there are also some ups and downs in there, I should note, including the fact that there is some sensitivity to the expense base to the strength of the dollar, or weakness in this case. And while some of that is offset in revenue, it's a little noisy, so that's a factor as well. It's small, but I'm just highlighting that there's some slightly non-obvious things that are non-strategic, obviously.\n",
      "Jamie Dimon (CEO): Can I just add a management thing that I think is very important. And I always talk about good expenses and bad expenses and the good expenses of the bankers and branches that we think will pay off and – but there are also bad expenses, which I would put in the category of bureaucracy, lack of efficiency, things you don't need to do.\n",
      "And you can – if you go to – if you read my Chairman's letter, the last section is called Management Learnings. And if you look at companies that over time fail, it's almost always bureaucracy, complacency, arrogance and lack of attention to detail. And so there is – we're making a – I shouldn't say it, but I'm mad at myself for not doing it sooner to spend a little more time that after COVID – the buildup in headcount, the buildup in rules and regulations, the people working or not working from home. After all of those things, we just think there's more efficiency here.\n",
      "And I think some of the – and Mike Mayo mentioned the bit about regulation. He is right. There will be reductions in cost because rules and regulations will be modified a little bit. I mean we – I pointed out resolution/recovery, which is a complete waste of time, is 80,000 pages long. Okay. It will never happen that way. Comprehensive Capital Analysis, which is virtually a waste of time, is 20,000 pages long. Okay. We report 1 trillion – I think it's 1 trillion bits of data every day or something like that to the – all the various regulators and stuff like that. There is this excessive cost built up that we – that hopefully we can get rid of and will reduce the cost of the system and – but it's not the new branches, so.\n",
      "And the folks here are working on, we call it, streamlining. Jenn Piepszak has got a war room going on it. We already have a significant amount of saves and stuff like that, so – and we're having fun doing it. It's like – to me, it's like exercising and eating your spinach. It's what we should be doing. We haven't done it for a while, so – and I apologize to my shareholders for not having done this a little bit sooner.\n",
      "Saul Martinez (Analyst): Okay. That's very clear. Very helpful. Thank you.\n",
      "Jeremy Barnum (CFO): Okay. Thanks very much.\n",
      "Evasiveness Score: 2, Justification: The answer is mostly direct. The CFO acknowledges that some investments could be pulled back if the environment changes to make them less compelling, and the CEO clarifies that they are focused on cutting 'bad expenses' (bureaucracy, inefficiency) rather than 'good expenses' like branches and bankers, which were specifically mentioned in the question. While specific quantitative conditions are not provided, the executives clearly articulate their cost management philosophy and priorities in a slowdown scenario, directly addressing the core of the analyst's question.\n"
