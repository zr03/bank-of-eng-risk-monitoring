      "And as it relates to buybacks, we did not buy back any stock this quarter and we will continue to make that decision on a quarter-by-quarter basis.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "And as it relates to your question regarding capital, this in a normal cycle is a very healthy returning business, and as the market turns and as we recover, we would look to deploy capital appropriate with the growth and return prospects that we see in front of us.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "So think about the Basel III end game that's out there and the capital requirements that could come out of that. Think about the CCAR DFAST that has been submitted and currently under review, and what that might mean for stress capital buffers, and also think about just where we are in the broader economy and broader global macro environment that we're playing in and needing to see how that kind of evolves. And so when I think about all of those factors, we're in a place where we will continue to take it quarter-by-quarter, but I'd end by saying our bias is kind of where yours is, which is given where we're trading, all things being equal, we'd like to be buying back shares, but we have to be responsible about that and the timing of that.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Thank you. I guess just one question, Mark, around capital. So, you talked about $13 billion over the reg minimum. Like you could easily be doing 2x the buyback you did in one quarter, if not more. I know you don't like to talk about out-quarters, but give us a sense of the case this quarter. Should we expect the pace of buybacks to increase? And if you could provide additional color as we think about the rest of the year would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Sure. Look, you know and I've said it repeatedly, Jane has said it repeatedly, given where we trade, we think buying back is smart and we'd like to do as much as we possibly can and as much as makes sense in light of the uncertainty that's out there. We have run at about 13.5% this quarter. That does give us capacity above the 13.3%. But it's important to keep in mind that there's client demand that will continue to evolve. We want to make sure we can support the clients that want to do business with us, whether that be in Markets or other parts of the franchise.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "And then, there's still uncertainty out there about how the capital regulation evolves. The good news is we are hearing kind of favorable things about how the Basel III Endgame proposal could evolve, but that hasn't happened yet. It's not finalized. It's not in place yet. And so, we want to see how that continues to play out. We're obviously in the midst of a CCAR process. We want to see how that evolves, and we'll continue to take the buyback decision on a quarter-by-quarter basis. But we recognize that there's an opportunity there, and we'll get after it just as soon as it makes good sense for us.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "We increased both our return on tangible common equity in each business and our return of capital to our shareholders. This quarter is a further proof point of how the consistent execution of our strategy is improving our performance.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "During the quarter, we returned $2.8 billion in capital to our shareholders including $1.75 billion of buybacks as part of our $20 billion plan, which is about $250 million more than we had originally guided.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "That’s our highest quarterly amount since 2022 and demonstrates our commitment to returning capital.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "And then we've continued to optimize the use of our balance sheet and the capital that we have. You see that we have brought our CET1 down to 13.4%. We're continuing to return capital. Those become very important aspects to getting to that target.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Yes. So, I'd say a couple of things. So one, last quarter, we announced a $20 billion share repurchase program. And we continue to feel good about that program, as you would expect. And we increased our buybacks this year, or this quarter, I should say, to the $1.75 billion, seeing the strength of the performance that was playing out through the quarter. And so those are both, I think, indications of our continued commitment to returning capital to the shareholders. We're clear on where we're trading, and we're clear that, that is a smart thing to do once we've funded demand from a client point of view across our businesses, that's accretive to returns. And so, the RWA consumption is tied to that demand that we see. We think we've seen good client demand across the platform that's helped drive the top line momentum that you see in each and every one of our businesses that's helped to drive the improved returns that you see in the quarter in each and every one of our businesses. And as we see that demand, again, accretive in returns, we'll be looking to meet that as a first priority. We are targeting the 13.1% [CET1 Capital ratio] by the end of the year. But as you know, we'll get a new stressed capital buffer in June on the heels of the DFAST/CCAR work that's just been submitted, and we'll have to see what that tells us. That's hard to forecast as you well know. And so based on what that tells us will inform that downward trajectory, but that is what we're focused on. The combination of funding growth that's accretive to returns and returning capital to shareholders in a way that's consistent with that repurchase program.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Hi good morning. Two questions. Just first on the buyback. I noticed you came in at $1.75 billion. Is that right this quarter?\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "And I know you indicated that you're looking to keep pace. And I'm wondering, does that mean at $1.75 billion or does that mean keep pace with the increased Q-on-Q, which was $250 million? And so, I know you're laughing, just trying to understand how you're thinking about that, given what we discussed last quarter, which is you have so much opportunity here for buyback and the accretion is so powerful. So, if you don't mind.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Sure. So, look, we're targeting a similar level. As you know, we've been working to bring the CET1 [Capital ratio] down. We brought it down 20 basis points this quarter. We're still focused on bringing it down to 13.1%. There is uncertainty. The uncertainty is multifaceted. And to some extent, you think about the uncertainty with the SCB. We'll hopefully get some clarity on that as we often do in the summer, and that will inform the pace at which we bring that that down. And then there's the broader market uncertainty, and we want to obviously be there to support clients, and the demand may come on the heels of that. And so, this quarter, like I said, similar level of share repurchases. $20 billion program that we will continue to work through. SCB clarity soon, hopefully, favorable clarity, and we're steadfast focused on it. Jane, I don't know if you want to add anything to that?\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "We like buying back and giving capital back to our shareholders. So, it's a priority for us and will continue to be.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Hi, good afternoon. Just a follow-up question here on the buyback pacing. Your message has been pretty clear about the first half versus the second half. That said, with the stock at $65 versus tangible book at $90, I guess, are you just so scared from the volatility of the SCB result that, that just must be hurdle before you can accelerate the buyback? And Mark, perhaps if you could sort of dispel some of the notion that sometimes happens in some of these chats with buy-siders about your inability to dividend from the bank sub to the holding company in order to increase your buybacks over the near term. If you could address that, too, that would be great.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Yes, sure. So, look, we have accelerated the pace of buybacks. And I think this quarter is a good example where I had guided for $1.5 billion, and we kicked it up to $1.75 billion. And I think you should expect that as we see opportunities to continue to do that, then we're going to do it. And you should expect that given where we are trading relative to book value that we're constantly focused on those opportunities to take it up more than we had planned or more than expected.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "I think in terms of your other question with regard, your question implying whether there are any restrictions. We don't have any restrictions on the buybacks. We would not have announced a $20 billion buyback program if we didn't think we could execute the program in a reasonable amount of time. And so obviously, we disclosed what we dividend out from the bank, and you can look at that over the last three years, we've dividend somewhere in the range of $0 to $5 billion in any given quarter.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "But again, there are no restrictions imposed by the FRB, which governs the parent on the ability to pay dividends and buy back stock. In addition to that, we have multiple sources of funding, including loans to subsidiaries, which could be remitted as well as debt issuance programs as well as the earnings that are generated that put - we are well positioned to do, to execute on the program that we've described and to continue our desired pace of buybacks.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Thanks for taking my questions. A couple of them as follow-ups to questions that have been asked. First one for you, Mark. The doing buybacks of the dividending from the bank to the holding company that we just asked. How much are you willing to let your double leverage go up? Is there any sort of internal limits that you follow, what would be the implications of that from a funding cost standpoint?\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Yes. Look, we have internal limits. We have management action triggers internally. We're not anywhere close to those limits or triggers. It's not something that I'm worried about as it relates to the buyback program that I have and/or the buybacks that we forecasted over the balance of the year.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Second, we returned $2.0 billion in the form of common dividends and share repurchases, which drove a reduction of about 18 basis points\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "And as it relates to buybacks, we will continue to make that decision on a quarter-by-quarter basis.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "And since you mentioned you're evaluating buybacks quarter-by-quarter. I guess the question here is, how should I think about that relative to, we get Basel endgame coming out soon because clearly, when you’ re at 13.3% against the new reg cap SCB, you know it signals a bigger opportunity for buybacks over the coming quarters. So how should I think about that?\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "You should take confidence that we're at the levels, including the management buffer that we expect to be for the rest of the year. We've proven a good case of being able to build capital that's for sure over the last 2 years. And you take comfort as well we increased the dividend, we had $2 billion of capital returned last quarter, so our intentions are clear to return capital where we can, but also to be prudent in how we do so, given environment and current regulatory uncertainty.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "So, I apologize having to ask the expense question again, but I think it's just very important because there's really two potential long-only investment thesis on Citi, right? One is the buyback given your tangible book values at $85 and the and the stock at $46 other is the spending the curve on expenses. So let me just ask Jim's question another way. In looking back to 2017, and I'm just looking at 2017 because I can break out legacy and core that way. And fast forward to 2022, you produced revenues ex Legacy Franchises about $61 billion in 2017 and about $67 billion in 2022. The associated expenses, again, without Legacy Franchises was about $34.5 billion in billion in 2017 versus $43.5 billion 2022, so you're surpassing the revenue uplift during that period by $3 billion.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Sure. And again, I think that if you look at the transactions that we've closed to date, they've generated or freed up about $4.6 billion of capital the two that remain to be closed and the balance of year will generate another $1.2 billion or so. That will be important to our capital base. I think that we obviously have to see the proposal as it comes out and the NPR. And we'll have a window to respond to that. We're hopeful that the regulators hear our response and views on it as it comes out.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Just remember, it's a return to normal.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Couple of questions. Number one, so capital, Jane and Mark, going back to that, should we expect that given what you've mentioned, given everything going on in the regulatory environment, ratio you're at currently, it should grow in anticipation of what may come or likely to come with all the regulatory stuff? Or are you going to try and keep that closer to the 13.3%?\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "The amended consent order with the OCC allows CBNA, to continue paying to Citigroup, at a minimum, the dividends necessary for debt service, preferred dividends, and other non-discretionary obligations. While we are developing and seeking OCC consent for our Resource Review Plan, dividend amounts above that would require the OCC’s non-objection.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "These dividends are intercompany payments that are made from CBNA ultimately to the parent, Citigroup. They should not be confused with the common dividends Citigroup pays to its shareholders.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Indeed, there is no restriction on Citigroup’s ability to pay common dividends to shareholders, nor is there a restriction to buying back shares.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "And let me be very clear, even with the investments needed for our Transformation, Citigroup has more than sufficient resources to also invest in our businesses, and make the planned return of capital to our shareholders. We will increase our dividend from 53 to 56 cents a share, as we announced in late June, and will resume modest buybacks this quarter.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "During the quarter, we returned $1 billion in capital to our common shareholders, and we are increasing our dividend by 6%. We expect to buyback $1 billion in common shares this quarter and we will continue to assess the level of buybacks on a quarterly basis, particularly given the uncertainty around the Basel III endgame.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "And as a reminder, we announced an increase to our common dividend from $0.53 per share to $0.56 per share following the SCB results. And as Jane mentioned earlier, we plan on doing $1 billion of buybacks this quarter.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Got it. And my second question is for Jane and I'm sure you're getting tired of the question on capital return. So, you're buying back $1 billion, you plan to buy back $1 billion this quarter. It looks like you didn't buy back any in the second quarter. And I'm asking this question in this context because consensus has a buyback of nearly $1 billion in the fourth quarter and staying at this rate for the first half of next year and ramping higher. And I guess, is the $1 billion number a catch-up pace because you didn't buy back any in the second quarter? And I fully appreciate that you also have the Banamex IPO coming, which is different from peers that are also waiting for Basel clarification. But I'm just wondering, do we need to wait for that Banamex IPO for the company to feel comfortable moving away from that quarter-to-quarter guidance? And also, of course, I just want to readdress the beginning of the question when I asked specifically about the pace.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Okay. So, we are not going to be giving guidance going forward around our buybacks. We are going to continue to give quarterly and make it a quarterly determination as to the level. And a lot of that is to do with the uncertainty about the forthcoming regulatory changes. I think we were delighted to see a slight reduction in our Stress Capital Buffer, reflecting the financial strength and resiliency of our business model and also good to see the benefits of our strategy playing out. But with the regulatory changes uncertain, that's one of the major factors for us to continue with the quarterly guidance.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Yeah, that's right. And on the first part of your question, Erika, I'd say, look, we were in discussions with our regulators and we made a prudent call as it relates to buybacks in the quarter for Q2. So, Q3, as we talked about, would be at $1 billion and that should not be necessarily viewed as a run rate level. As Jane mentioned, we'll take it quarter by quarter from here.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Okay. And then just separately on the very early kind of part of the prepared remarks, you talked about the dividends being capped in terms of what could be upstream from the bank to the holding company because of the OCC that came out this week. For all intents and purposes, like does that impact how you run the company or subsidiary or impact liquidity or capital? I understood the comment, no change to dividends or buybacks at the holding company, but is there any impact from that that we would notice on the outside? Thank you.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Look, let's be clear, this action does not impact our ability to return capital to our shareholders. The dividends that are referenced are just intercompany payments from CBNA to the parent. So, first of all, don't confuse what a dividend is here. We will, it's not going to impact how we run the company, the subsidiary, the capital, the liquidity at all and the dividends are not capped.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "So, the regulators want essentially the same thing we want, right, is for us to get this done, right, and so that is the primary objective. The reference to the dividending from out of CBNA up to the parent is certainly referenced there between now and establishing that Resource Review Plan. But as Jane mentions, that does not constrain the parent from doing the things that it will need to do. And as opposed to, it's not a cap. What it is, is that anything above the debt service of the parent or the preferred dividends and other nondiscretionary obligations would require a non-objection from the OCC.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Hi. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Just, I guess I just want to follow up on the latter question. I just want to be very clear. So, what you're saying is that the requirement that CBNA receive a non-objection before dividending upstream to the parent, that does not impact how you think about your capital flexibility, how you think about – it doesn't restrict you in any way and shouldn't impact, for example, your ability to benefit from, for example, a Basel Endgame rule that is softened or some of the benefits, Mark, that you talked about in terms of simplification. So, you don't see this impacting your ongoing level of capital flexibility and your ability to repurchase stock going forward if some of these things actually do play out?\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "We continue to evaluate buybacks quarter-by-quarter and I expect we will continue to do a modest level in the fourth quarter, subject to approval by our Board. And while the ultimate impact of potentially higher capital requirements won’t be known until the Basel III endgame is finalized, we have been actively working through mitigating actions.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "During the quarter, we returned $2.1 billion in capital, including the repurchase of $1 billion of common shares.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "We will continue to repurchase stock as we evaluate the right level on a quarterly basis.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Second, we returned $2.1 billion in the form of common dividends and share repurchases, which drove a reduction of 18 basis points.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "We will take all of this into account as it relates to capital levels and the level of share repurchases on a quarter-by-quarter basis.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Returning to shareholders, particularly given where we're trading, and making sure that we drive to returns.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "The timing is going to get driven by how we maximize shareholder value and that will be market conditions. So that's where we stand.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "And then just separately I think in the prepared remarks you guys mentioned a modest provision within Services for some of the unremitted corporate dividends and I just wanted to clarify that and what country is that. And I guess I thought there wasn't really much liability to you guys from that, so any clarification on that. I know it's a small amount, but that would be helpful. Thank you.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Okay. But still feel like there's not risk to you guys from all those kind of trapped dividends, I guess why take a small reserve if there's legally no risk to you guys?\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Yeah. We've got to wait and see what the market conditions will be but the North Star for me and for Mark is crystal clear, it is optimizing and maximizing our shareholder value.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "And then last follow-up. To the extent that you see a disconnect between your performance and the stock price that would seem to create more of an opportunity to buy the stock at $64 when tangible book value is $90. And so, I hope that – I've used this analogy before, but hopefully you're selling the chairs and the desk and the silverware in the executive dining room to go ahead and buy back stock whenever you can.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "First, we generated $8.0 billion of net income to common, which added 70 basis points.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Second, we returned $6.1 billion in the form of common dividends and share repurchases, which drove a reduction of about 53 basis points.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Third, we benefitted from the impact of lower rates on our AFS investment portfolio, which drove an increase of 20 basis points.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "And we are committed to returning capital to our shareholders and in fact expect to do modest buybacks in 1Q 2024.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Hi good morning. Mark, was hoping to ask you, how are you thinking about the pacing of capital build? Obviously, the Basel III proposals are out there, but they could change, of course. Even if they don't change, you have a couple of years to leg into those with the phase-ins and perhaps some mitigation opportunities. How should we think about you kind of building capital, given all those variables and the ability to buy back some stock along the way as you mentioned earlier?\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "We're trading at a 0.5 times book, where we can, we want to buy back as much as we can in shares. And we try to be disciplined about that over the past couple of quarters, doing that as a modest level. You heard me say, we're going to do that again this quarter at a modest level, but we have to be thoughtful about what those headwinds might look like. And we're actively working what mitigation actions we have to put in place, should it turn out closer to the way the current proposal sits.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "So, it's an ongoing active management that tries to balance servicing our client needs, with, obviously, holding a responsible amount of capital in light of the uncertainty that's out there, and with an eye towards buybacks where we can do that.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Hi. I'm sorry to prolong the call. Thank you for all your color. Just one more question. Jane, when will you feel comfortable giving us a buyback outlook that's beyond just fourth quarter? I know you still have a little bit of ways to go, but you do have 100 basis point buffer to your minimum. And I know Basel III endgame is still out there, and I'm sure that reducing risk just doesn't mean expenses, but also reducing your – or being mindful of your RWA footprint. And given where your stock is relative to book, when will you be more comfortable about giving sort of a longer-term outlook that was underpinning your RoTCE target with regards to the buyback?\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "After repurchasing $1 billion in common shares during the fourth quarter, we returned almost $7 billion in capital to our common shareholders in 2024. Given how committed we are to returning capital, I am particularly pleased to announce that our Board authorized a $20 billion share repurchase program.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "We are committed to driving positive operating leverage and improving our returns every year for both the firm and the businesses, and we will do so in a sustainable way which will set this company up for long-term success. With that in mind, as part of the $20 billion share repurchase program, we plan on buying back $1.5 billion of common stock in the first quarter.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Okay. Great. That's very helpful. And then just maybe pivoting to the buyback, great to see the $20 billion authorization. Obviously, I can't help but ask about beyond 1Q. If we do sort of get this more certainty maybe no increase in capital requirements, does that start to help you maybe at least temporarily lower the buffer to take advantage of, you’re trading below tangible book and getting the accretion and accelerating the buyback? Or how do you think about the rest of the year on the buybacks?\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Look, I'll make a couple of comments. So one, we're very pleased to have announced the buyback program at $20 billion. I think, in many ways, that is a demonstration, if you will, of continued confidence in the earnings generation and momentum that we have around that as well as the recognition that we are trading below book and not where we want to be. And you've heard both Jane and I speak to the importance of increasing and doing more in the way of buybacks.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "And despite the last couple of quarters at running above the 13.1%, our target is the 13.1%. And so as we go through the balance of the year, as we get clarity on reg rules and what have you, you'll see us continue to manage down to that 13.1% and obviously, the two important characteristics that we keep in mind is the opportunity to invest more in the business at accretive returns, and where we're trading and the need to do more buybacks in order to reflect the underlying value. So target is 13.1%. We continue to look at that management buffer as the regulatory environment evolves. And we'll continue to do more in the way of capital actions as that makes sense.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Hi good morning. Jane, just to follow up on what you mentioned, as you do execute, we all expect, or at least I do, that the market will be giving you credit for that execution, and meaning multiples should increase. I have a few questions here on the buyback, because right now, today, as we all know, you're trading below book, it has got to be, buying back stock has got to be the most accretive use of capital today.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "And why wait on the buyback when you can lean into it today and keep your 2026 guide, I mean, the old guide was 11% to 12% RoTCE, new guide, 10% to 11%.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Yes, Betsy, I love the passion. I've got to say I can hear the determination in your voice. I think it's the same determination we feel. Look, we're very committed to returning capital shareholders period. Full stop. We’ve got a $20 billion buyback program, as Mark said, that is reflective of the growing earnings power that we have and our confidence in the path ahead. We've been increasing the amount of capital return over the last few quarters. I'm also happy to see a more aggressive Basel III scenario firmly off the table.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Thank you. Hate to ask the umpteenth question on the buyback, but clearly, the way the stock is reacting today, the buyback is very important to your shareholders. I guess my first question, if I could have the two questions, is it's very clear that you want to return capital to shareholders. It's very clear that you have excess capital. It's very clear that your PPNR trajectory is positive. And so what are the specific mile markers that that Citi needs to see in order to increase that pacing from that $1.5 billion a quarter to something is more suggestive of a pace that that would be in line with that $20 billion authorization? And I know that's been asked of you already, but is it the consent order? Is it the stress test? We had some news over the holidays that were positive for the sector. Like what are those specific mile markers? I mean you're doing it on the PPNR side, right? Like what do you need to see to have even more confidence, again, like leaning into Betsy’s words, to go all in on the buyback?\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "The second point I want to be clear is that it's not the consent order. That's not something that that is impacting the capital actions and decisions that we take. We obviously forecast out the performance. As I've said, Jane has said already, we see very strong continued earnings momentum, managing towards a 13.1% CET1 ratio. And you'll see the buyback trajectory reflect getting down to that CET1.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "The one thing I will mention, and you mentioned already is that we obviously have another CCAR process, stress test that we will go through. And none of us can predict kind of what's on the other side of that from an SCB point of view, but that will be an important factor as we get through the first half of the year and into the second half of the year in terms of kind of the level of buybacks that we will be taking on a quarter-by-quarter basis.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "So I hope that helped. There are no artificial constraints, so to speak, that are in place. This is us planning and forecasting the performance of the franchise ensuring they can fuel high-returning growth opportunities so that we're building a sustainable franchise, looking at the capital requirements that we have and the management buffer that we put in place and therefore, taking that excess capacity and putting it towards buybacks, but with an eye towards the regulatory environment that we're in, and what I mean by that are the capital requirements that come out of the annual stress testing process that's run. So that's the basics of it as we sit here today.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "And in line with what we previously said, we resumed stock buybacks this quarter and distributed a total of $1.9 billion in net repurchases back to shareholders.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "But what are some of the changes that you're scenario planning for – whether it's higher capital, increase in FDIC assessment fees? And along those same lines, how you're thinking about the buyback given continued strong capital build, but a lot of macro uncertainty at the moment.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Got it. And just in terms of appetite for the buyback, just given some of the...\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Obviously, capital is more than that, but – and we did a little bit of buyback this quarter. We're going to wait and see.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Yeah. Got it. Okay, that's super helpful to understand how you think through that. And then the follow-up is just on the buybacks. So do I take your comments to mean that you're on pause now?\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "So, a couple of questions here. Just, one, Jamie, could you talk through the decision to raise the dividend kind of mid-cycle, it felt like, pre-CCAR? And also, help us understand how you're thinking about where that payout ratio, that dividend payout ratio, range should be. Because over the past several years, it's been somewhere between 24% and 32%. And so, is this suggesting we could be towards the higher-end of that range or even expanding above that?\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "And, yes, we've always had the capital hierarchy the same way, which is we're going to use capital to build our business first, I mean, pay the dividend – steady dividend, build the business, and if we think it's appropriate to buy back stock. We're continuing to buy back stock at $2 billion a quarter (sic). I personally do not want to buy back a lot more than that at these current prices. I think you've all heard me talk about the world, things like that. So, waiting in preparation for Basel. Hopefully we'll know something later, and then we can be much more specific with you all.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "So, it's a great position to be in. We're going to be very, very patient. I urge all the analysts to keep in mind, excess capital is not wasted capital, it's earnings in store. We will deploy it in a very good way for shareholders in due course.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "And yeah, Betsy, I just wanted to add my welcome back thoughts as well, and just a very minor edit to Jamie's answer. I think he just misspoken when he said $2 billion a year in buybacks. The trajectory is $2 billion...\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "This quarter, the Firm distributed $11 billion of capital to shareholders, which reflects $7.1 billion of net common share repurchases and the payment of our common dividend, which has been increased to $1.40 per share.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Okay. Got it. And then just on capital, how does this type of macro uncertainty impact your thinking around conserving capital as opposed to deploying it through your investment agenda and buybacks as the stock gets cheaper? Or just, are you still looking to arrest the increase or does this kind of change it?\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "The new SCB also reflects the board's intention to increase the dividend to $1.05 per share in the third quarter.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "So I think as I said in my prepared remarks, we feel very confident about the company's ability to produce excellent returns through the cycle. There's a lot of moving parts right now in that; some of them could be good, some of them could be bad.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Narrowly, on the capital one, the one thing to point out is that the straight-up math of simply diluting down the ROTCE by expanding the denominator misses the possibility of reprice, repricing of products and services, which of course goes back to our point that these capital increases do have impacts on the real economy.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Okay. That's helpful. And with a number of years for this to phase in and you generating capital at a high level even if the ROTCE comes down a bit, how should we think about your pace of building capital for these new changes versus doing your everyday course of investing and buybacks and things like that over the next couple years?\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Yeah. I mean, I guess I'm sort of tempted to give you our standard capital hierarchy here. I mean, we're not going to sacrifice investments, right? That won't come as a surprise to you.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Okay. And there's some room for buybacks?\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Yeah. No, just do buybacks play a role in the next couple years strategically? Do you episodically buy back?\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "I mean, capital hierarchy again, right? In the end, when we have nothing else to do with the money, we'll do buybacks.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "These results included the $7.9 billion net gain related to Visa shares and the $1 billion Foundation contribution of the appreciated Visa stock.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "And finally, the Firm announced that the board intends to increase the quarterly common stock dividend from $1.15 to $1.25 per share in the third quarter of 2024.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "And so, in that sense, I feel like on the overall capital return and buyback trajectory, not much has actually changed relative to what I laid out at Investor Day, the comments that I made then, the comments that Jamie made then, as well as the comments that Jamie made the subsequent week at an industry conference.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "On the capital hierarchy, it's also worth noting that's another thing that remains unchanged, so I'll review it quickly. Growing the business organically and inorganically, sustainable dividend, and in that context it's worth noting that the board's announced intention to increase it to $1.25 is a 19% increase prior to last year. So, that's a testament to our performance and that is a return of capital.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "And then, finally buybacks. But that hierarchy does not commit us to return 100% of the capital generation in any given quarter. And so, as we sit here today, when you look at the relationship between the opportunity cost of not deploying the capital and the opportunities to deploy the capital outside the Firm, it's kind of hard to imagine an environment where that relationship argues more strongly for patience.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "So, given all that, putting it all together, and sorry for the long answer, we remain comfortable with the current amount of excess capital. And as Jamie has said, we really continue to think about it as earnings in store as much as anything else.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Okay, got it. That's helpful. Just following up on capital returns on Steve's question, I think you highlighted in response it's a matter of when, not if, and obviously, Jamie’s not there, you can’t speak for Jamie, but seems to have shown limited enthusiasm for a special dividend or buybacks at current valuations. Can you just give us a sense of how you’re thinking about the various options? Any updated thoughts on a special dividend?\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "And can you do other things like, for example, have a material increase in your dividend payout, sort of a step function increase, where keep that flat and grow into that, grow your earnings into that over time? Can you just maybe give us a sense of how you're thinking about what options you have available to deploy that capital?\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "And I think this comment there about the special dividend was that it's not really our preference. We hear from people that many of our investors wouldn't find that particularly appealing, and he said as much that it wouldn't be sort of our first choice.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "And then, the dividend, I think we're always going to want to keep it in that sort of, like sustainable and also sustainable in a stressed environment so that continues to be the way we think about that.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "And then, at the end of it, it's buybacks and Jamie's been on the record for over a decade, I think, over many shareholder letters, talking about how he thinks about price and buybacks and valuation and price is a factor. So, that's sort of the totality of the set of options, I guess.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Let me just zoom out for one more question on the return target. I mean, when I asked Jamie at the 2013 Investor Day, would it make sense to have 13.5% capital, he was basically telling me to take a hike, right? And now, you have 15.3% capital and you're saying, well, we might want to have a lot more capital here.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "So, I did want to ask one drill-down question on 2Q, and it's related to the dollar amount of buybacks that you did do. I think in the press release, right, in the slide deck, it's $4.9 billion common stock net repurchases. So, the question here is, what's the governor for you on how much to do every quarter?\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "And, I mean, I understand it's a function of, okay, how much do we organically grow. But even with that, so you get the organic growth, which you had some nice movement there. But you do the organic growth and then is it how much do we earn and we want to buy back our earnings or how should we be thinking about what that repurchase volume should be looking like over time?\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "And I remember over at Investor Day the whole debate around I don't want to buy back my stock, but we are, right? So, I get this question from investors quite a bit of how should we be thinking about how you think about what the right amount is to be doing here.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Yeah. That's a very good and fair question, Betsy. So, let me try to unpack it to the best of my ability. So, in no particular order, one thing that we've really tried to emphasize in a number of different settings, including in our recent 10-Qs actually is that we don't want to get into the business of guiding on buybacks.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "So, we're going to buy back whatever we think makes sense in the current moment sort of and we reserve the right to sort of change that at any time. So, I recognize that not everyone loves that, but that is kind of a philosophical belief and so, I might as well say it explicitly. It was pretty clear in the Q also, but I'm just going to say that again. So, that's point one.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Obviously, when for whatever reason, if we ever need to build capital in a hurry, we've done it before and we're always comfortable suspending buybacks entirely. But I think some modest amount of buybacks is a reasonable thing to do when you're generating your kind of capital.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "So, we talked about – Jamie talked about, as we liquidate the Visa, deploying those proceeds into JPM and that’s what we did this quarter. So, that is why the $4.9 billion is a little higher, and it’s consistent with my comments at Investor Day around having slightly increased the amount of buybacks.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "And beyond that, what you’re left with is my answer to Steve’s question, which is that, to your point about buying back earnings or whatever, when we’re generating these types of earnings and there’s this much organic capital being generated in the absence of opportunities to deploy it organically or inorganically and while continuing to maintain our healthy, but sustainable dividend, if we don’t return the capital we are going to keep growing the CET1 ratio to levels, which, if you think about the long strategic outlook of the company, are not reasonable.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "One question that we've gotten is how to reconcile that build to the 12% growth in OS that we've talked about because it seems like a little bit high relative to what you would have otherwise assumed if you apply some sort of a standard coverage ratio to that growth. But the reason that's the case is essentially a combination of higher revolving mix, as we continue to see some normalization revolve in that 12%, as well as seasoning of earlier vintages, which comes with slightly higher allowance per unit of OS growth.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Oh, hey, good morning. Maybe just one last question on sort of deploying excess capital. It seems like the two primary ways to do that organically would be through the trading book or the loan book. So, maybe two questions there. One, trading assets were up 20% year-over-year. Is that you leaning into it or just a function of demand? And is there further opportunities to grow that?\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "We had $2 billion of net share repurchases this quarter, and the pace of buybacks will likely remain modest in light of the Basel III Endgame proposal.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "In line with our capital hierarchy, we will continue to reassess the buyback trajectory as circumstances evolve or opportunities emerge.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Given that context, the absence of detailed analysis supporting a capital increase of this magnitude is disconcerting and there's a lot that does not make sense to us.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "For the purposes of this call, we wanted to make the equally important broader points about both the level of capital increase and the flaws in the construct of the framework itself, since coherent design is critical to the framework's durability over time.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "So that's that, and then the other part of your question implicitly was talking about organic capital generation and I think it's just very important to separate impacts on the economy and impacts on long-term returns from our ability to meet the requirements.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "We had $6.0 billion of net common share repurchases this quarter, which in part reflects the deployment of the proceeds from the sale of Visa shares, as we have previously mentioned.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "And if I can ask my second question, and, Jamie, I completely understand your frustration. And to be fair, your long-term shareholders really don't care about whether it's $87 billion or $85 billion. Right? They care about your return on equity. To that end, I mean, it's insane how much capital you generate each quarter, 72 basis points this quarter.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "And again, beyond that boilerplate conversation that you always get every quarter, how should your shareholders think about how you're thinking about the opportunities to deploy this capital?\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "And so that's where we are, and that's not going to change. And if it changes, we'll let you know. We do talk to a lot of shareholders, and they understand that buying stock back at more than two times tangible book value is not necessarily the best thing to do, because we think we'll have better opportunities to redeploy it or to buy back at cheaper prices at one point. Markets do not stay high forever.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "One last thing. Cash is a very valuable asset sometimes in a turbulent world. And you see my friend Warren Buffett stockpiling cash right now. I mean, people should be a little more thoughtful about how we're trying to navigate in this world and grow for the long term for our company.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Yeah. When I said we're at $30 billion of excess, that is assuming Barr's speech, that the 20% goes to 12% or whatever it is, more. It'll be more than that because there are other factors involved. Now, I was just giving the minimum of excess capital. In my view, it would be more, but it is what it is and we'll wait to see the final numbers.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Let me take the flip side of that question for those of you who are worried about you leaving. The other side of the question is we were on these calls the last couple of years. You're saying the stock is over-valued, and I think that's what you're saying. You're saying the stock market is over-valued and therefore all stocks are over-valued. And on the one hand, you guys, you highlight on this call AI, tech, market share gains, high returns, high capital. So, do you think in some ways when we think about the value of your price, and your ability to do buybacks, you're thinking more about an old school model for valuing your stock as opposed to a new school model that might put you in the category of more tech-oriented firms, especially as it relates to your progress with AI.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Listen, you're making a very good point, which is I think we have an exceptional company, exceptional franchises, and the price point at which you might buy the stock. But I'm not that exuberant about thinking even tech valuations or any valuations will stay at these very inflated values. And so I'm just – we're just quite patient in that, and I think you're going to have to judge us over time about whether we're done the right thing to do nothing. And remember, we could always do it. We haven't lost the money. It didn't go away. It's sitting in store. The only time that would be really wrong is if the stock runs way up, we've got to buy at much higher prices. And I just, I would be a real skeptic about that happening.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Okay. And then just separately, you bought back couple of billion dollars of stock this quarter. What's your thought process on buybacks given the strong capital generation, but also some uncertainty on regulatory proposals?\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Yeah. Good question. And I think you framed it exactly correctly in the sense that we obviously have a lot of buyback capacity in general based on our organic capital generation. So, the normal capital hierarchy will apply. But for now, we plan to remain on a modest pace of buybacks consistent with that kind of $2 billion net buyback a quarter number that we've talked about and that you've seen us do, in light of the – probably the need to continue building to have a bit of a buffer, as you said, the uncertainty about the finalization of the rules. And also just as a reminder, the SCB is probably a little bit low right now and has been quite volatile. So, that's another factor that we need to keep in mind.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Hi. Good morning. My first question is a follow-up on Matt's with regarding the buyback. You printed 15% CET1 in the quarter. On a net basis, net of RWA growth, your net income produces 51 basis points every quarter. Again, that's net of RWA growth. I'm wondering what guideposts you're looking for, Jeremy, in terms of that buyback increasing from that $2 billion a quarter. Do we need to wait for Basel III finalization, which seems like it could be quite delayed? Or will having clarity in the June D-FAST results – you mentioned the SCB – sort of be enough that you could reconsider this pace over the medium term?\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Yeah. Erika, that's a good question. And I understand what you're asking – why you're asking it. I think the answer is going to be a little bit unsatisfying, which is that this is classic decision-making under uncertainty and it's kind of a probabilistic cloud of a variety of different factors. But, all the ingredients that you've listed are the right ingredients; right, very strong organic capital generation, uncertainty about the finalization of the rule, uncertainty about the SCB requirements, and obviously, our normal capital hierarchy, which is that buybacks are always at the bottom of the hierarchy after we're done using the capital for our other priorities.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Hi. Good morning. Jeremy, I wanted to ask about capital, and I know you get this question a lot about the kind of high-class dilemma of your growing capital base and your perspective of that as earnings in store. So, I guess, what's the framework for thinking about the opportunity cost of sitting on the growing base of capital and how high you might let that go versus your patience in waiting for more attractive deployment opportunities?\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "So, yeah, you've noted all the points that we always make so I won't repeat them. And I think the way we're thinking about it right now is that we feel very comfortable with the notion that it makes sense for us to have a nice store of extra capital in light of the current environment. We believe there's a good chance that there will be a moment where we get to deploy it at better levels essentially in whatever way than the current opportunities would suggest. And so that feels like a correct kind of strategic and financial decision for us. Having said that, having studied it quite extensively over the last six months and have all the debates that you would expect, we've concluded that we do have enough. We have enough excess. And given that, we would like to not have the excess grow from here.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "So, when you think about the implications of that, given the amount of organic capital generation that we're producing, it means that unless we find in the near term opportunities for organic deployment or otherwise, it means more capital return through buybacks, all else being equal, in order to arrest the growth of the excess. And that is our current plan, although, I'll give the caveat that, as you know, is in our disclosure, which is we don't want to get in the business of guiding on buybacks, and we reserve the right to change the trajectory at any time for any reason, but that is our current thinking.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "So, as we think about the definition of excess, right, because part of this is like 15.7% is clearly a huge number. So, as we think about your returns going forward, the definition of excess also continues to shift. So, how should we think about those crosscurrents in terms of two big components, clearly, one is your G-SIB surcharge and the other is your stress capital buffer?\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "And then, taking a step back, at a high level, what you're really asking me is, what is our core view about, and I think probably the best way to think about this is just through the lens of the numerator, actually. What is our core view about if you just, for the sake of argument, assume modest growth in the normalized amount of economic denominator, like actual need for capital organically, what will be the likely additional numerator that will be needed or not as a function of the environment.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "And the way we're increasingly thinking about that is just doing different scenario analysis of like flat numerator, up 5% numerator, up 10% numerator, up 20% numerator. I guess there could be some versions of the world where the numerator's a little less. And then guessing about our central case and comparing our projected capital amount to that number to determine the excess. And as you point out, at 15.7%, and I think the actual quantum of the numerator is something like $275 billion, through pretty much any reasonable lens, it's a ton of excess, which is why we've concluded that it doesn't need to grow anymore.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Yeah. You've quoted our capital hierarchy, and your conclusion flows naturally from my statement that we do want to arrest the growth of the excess.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Very good. And then as a follow-up, circling back about the capital levels, you guys have been very clear about where you want them to be. Can you share the pros and cons from JPMorgan's perspective? Not so much from an investor, but we understand, of course, you can do a share repurchase. Obviously, you can do non-depository acquisitions with the excess capital. But what are the pros and cons of a special dividend to reduce that excess capital if you continue with these incredible profitability levels of 20% return on tangible common equity? You're growing your income and capital very nicely every year. But what are those pros and cons, again, from JPMorgan's perspective?\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "I was just going to say we're not going to do one. We have looked at it. If you all have any great insights for us, let us know, but most people don't want it, doesn't add shareholder value.

      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Hi. In your prepared remarks, you talked about intensifying certain efforts regarding regulatory processes and data on slide 4 here and was just wondering if you could elaborate on I guess what you're doing or trying to do differently on that front and if there's any meaningful financial impact. Thank you.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "And we're currently deep into a very large body of work, upgrading our data architecture, automating manual controls and processes, consolidating fragmented tech platforms, and all of these help enhance our business performance more broadly, not just the risk and control in the medium term.\n",

We keep a close eye on execution, making sure we've got the right level of resourcing and expertise and we'll invest what we need to do to make sure that we address these different concerns.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "I can't go into much more detail in terms of CSI obviously, but something of this magnitude you'd expect us to have some areas where we have good progress and others where we need to intensify efforts.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Turning to our strategic priorities, our transformation investments continue to modernize our infrastructure, simplify our processes, and reduce manual touchpoints. During the quarter, we retired legacy applications and automated reconciliations to name but a few accomplishments.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "At the same time, the transformation remains our #1 priority, and we will continue to make the investments needed, specifically as it relates to data and regulatory reporting.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "So, our focus is now ensuring we're delivering the risk reductions and the outcomes in a sustainable way. And I'm excited about the work we've been doing in making sure that our technology and our overall control environment is what we call modern and simple. We're simplifying and standardizing controls across common activities. We've put a lot more preventative and detective controls in place. We're upgrading others that weren't effective enough. We're driving automation. We're driving straight-through processing of our end-to-end processes across the bank. And you've heard us talk pretty consistently over the last couple of years about the work to make the technology infrastructure onto consolidating on to single platforms, retiring legacy applications.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "First, we continue to make investments in our Transformation and other risk and control initiatives which are necessary to modernize our infrastructure, automate our controls, as well as improve the client experience.

      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "We are investing in the execution of our Transformation and continue to see a shift in our investments from third-party consulting to technology and full-time employees.

      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "We'll realize the benefits from our investments in transformation and controls over the medium term. We'll also have the benefit of the remediation work getting done and expenses going away from that. And then the third one will be simplifying the organization, as we talked about. So, we'll continue to walk you, step by step, what are the different actions we're taking, what are we doing, and hopefully we are building up that track record of doing what we will say we are going to do every quarter.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Thank you, Jenn, and good morning to everyone. Before I discuss the results of the quarter, let me first address the regulatory actions by the Federal Reserve and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency which were announced on Wednesday. These actions pertain to the consent orders we entered into with both agencies in 2020 and those orders covered four primary areas: risk management, data governance, controls and compliance.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Addressing these areas is the primary goal of our Transformation, our number one priority. It is a multi-year effort to modernize our infrastructure, unify disparate tech platforms and automate processes and controls.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "This week’s actions focused primarily on data quality management. We have been public this year about the fact that we were behind in this particular area and that we had increased our investment as a result.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "The regulatory actions consisted of two civil money penalties and, under the amended consent order with the OCC, a new process designed to ensure we are allocating sufficient resources to meet our remediation milestones, called the Resource Review Plan. We are currently developing the Plan for submission to the OCC.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "And we are pleased that it was acknowledged on Wednesday that we have made meaningful progress in executing our Transformation, and simplifying our firm. A multi-year undertaking such as this was never going to be linear.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "The investments we have been making are starting to come together to reduce risk, improve controls and deliver tangible outcomes. The tech investments we have made are making a difference. We have reduced the time it takes to book loans; automated controls for our traders to reduce errors; moved risk analytics to a cloud-based infrastructure; and increased the resiliency of our platforms to reduce downtime.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "You have my and the entire management team’s commitment that we will address any area of the consent order where we are behind by putting the necessary resources and focus behind it. We will get this work where it needs to be, as we have with the execution of our strategy and the simplification of our organization.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "We have also made improvements in risk and compliance as we enhanced our risk assessments and technology capabilities to increase automation for monitoring.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "And in Data, while there is a lot more to do, we have stood up a data governance process and streamlined our data architecture to ultimately facilitate straight through processing. Overall, we have improved risk management, and consolidated and upgraded systems and platforms to improve our resiliency. These efforts represent meaningful examples of how we are making progress against our Transformation milestones.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "That said, we have fallen short in data quality management particularly related to regulatory reporting, which we have acknowledged publicly since the beginning of the year.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "As such, we have begun to put additional investments and resources in place to not only address data quality management related to regulatory reporting and data governance, but also related to stress testing capabilities, including DFAST and Resolution Recovery. We also re-prioritized our efforts to ensure we are focused on data that impacts these reports first.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "We take this feedback from our regulators very seriously and we are committed to allocating all the resources necessary to meet their expectations.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Hi. Could you elaborate more on the amended consent order, Jane? You said it was disappointing to have gotten that this week. It's almost four years into the consent order. And a little bit why it hasn't been resolved and what's on, that's the loss column and maybe a little bit more on the win column too. I mean, you have what 12,000 people thrown at the problem. Billions of dollars. Is it not enough people? Is it not enough money? Do you need to look at it in a different way? Are you not talking the same language?\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Yeah, and so as Jane says, the progress that we've made, it spans multiple parts of the consent order and transformation work. Remember, that consent order and transformation work includes risk, it includes controls, it includes compliance, it includes data and data related to the regulatory reporting, and we've got evidence and proof points of progress against all of those things.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "And just to add a couple of data points to that, Mike. You've heard us mention some of these before, but we've retired platforms. We've reduced the number of data centers. Platforms are down some 300. We've moved from 39 corporate loan platforms down to south of 20. We've got 20 cash equities execution platforms down to 1; we've reduced the 6 reporting ledgers down to 1; 11 sanctions platforms down to 1. So, we've been making considerable progress over the past couple of years.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "With that said, there's a lot more work to be done around the data regulatory reporting work. If you think about Citi, we've got 11,000 global total reg reports, right. So, we've got to make sure that the data that's going into those reports is the quality of the data that we want it to be, but more importantly, that we're doing it efficiently, that it doesn't take thousands of people to reconcile that information and so this is an end-to-end process in the way we're approaching it.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "One example is the 2052a liquidity report that we have. It has 750,000 lines of data and that data is, it's important again that we're efficiently collecting it from multiple systems with standards and governance that ensures it's of the quality that we want it to be without again having to have manual activity supporting it.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Got it. Okay. And just one follow-up on the OCC amendment and that's specifically related to the Resource Review Plan. Do you have a line of sight on how long that'll take you guys to finish because it seems like – and is that what we should be thinking about in terms of just understanding like what the side of what you need to get done in terms of the other language that's written in the order?\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "So, Ken, look, the Resource Review Plan is just that. It's a plan to ensure that we have sufficient resources allocated towards achieving a timely and sustainable compliance to the order.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Essentially if an area is delayed or looking as if it could be, we'll determine what additional resourcing, if any, is required to get back on track and then we'll share that with the OCC in a more formalized way than we do today and we obviously review this pretty constantly ourselves.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "No, you're not right. So, I think as you've heard us talk about, Vivek, for a while now, that we knew the areas that we were behind in elements of our transformation program and that we began addressing those and making the investments. Some of that's in people. Some of that is in technology spend. It's using different tools and capabilities to get areas addressed earlier and we began that earlier in the year and you saw that acknowledged as well by our regulators who pointed to the fact that we've already begun addressing the areas that we're behind.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Look, the plan, the Resource Review Plan, as Jane mentioned, is what we're working through now with the regulators. That will be a process for demonstrating to them that we are spending and allocating the appropriate resources to accomplishing the commitments that we have. Appropriate resources can range from people to technology to enhancing our processes and ensuring better execution.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Yeah, I think, Jane, that's right. And I think let's not lose sight of the purpose of the orders that are there and the purpose of the orders that are there are to ensure that we're funding and allocating the effort appropriately, right.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Until the Resource Plan is agreed and as you'll have seen, the Resource Plan needs to be submitted within 30 days, and as I indicated, we're working on that one and not anticipating that to be a problem.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Hi. Sorry, just to follow up on this whole consent order stuff, Jane. What do you think this does in terms of timing, how much longer for you to sort of get this past you? Are you talking couple of years? Is it now longer by a year? Any sense of that? Any sense of helping us think through that?\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Look, in terms of the consent order and the areas we've had delays, there are four areas to the consent order. It's risk management, it's data governance, it's around compliance and it's around control. As we've said, we were falling behind in certain areas related to data and we've been investing to address the areas that we were behind. We also saw an increase in the scope related to regulatory reporting, so we added some more bodies of work there and we're well underway. So, we are not expecting this to extend the original expectations that we have on when we will complete the body of work for the consent order.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Hi. Just two clarifications. So, this is a very high-profile amendment to the consent order. And I think what I hear you saying that if you can confirm, your risk compliance and controls are getting passing grade. It's really the data and as it relates to the data, you're talking about 11,000 regulatory reports, some which had 750,000 lines of data. Is that really the scope of what you need to fix? Because people see this externally and say, hey, you're failing in terms of overall controls and resiliency. But I think I hear you saying it's really more about just the data and the regulatory reporting, which is important, but more of a slice of a broader picture. Is that correct?\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "So, but what is the transformation doing? What it is doing is simplifying how data moves through the firm and it's about upgrading the management and governance over those flows. And as I've said, we're doing a strategic overhaul of large parts of our infrastructure, so what are we doing?\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "We're making sure we're capturing data accurately using smart tools and automation. We'll often talk about this smart system, makes sure there's no errors when we book a trade. We've seen our error rate down 85% as a result of it. We're housing our upstream data in two standardized repositories, they're the golden sources, an in-person data hub which you've heard me talk about a few times and they're a golden source now for all of the downstream data use, populating the thousands of regulatory reports Mark talked about and other areas. And what a single repository means is that the data models, the data quality rules, the controls you put in place that govern and manage that data, they all sit in one place rather than being distributed all over the firm as they have been historically.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Where we're behind, as we do the work on data, we identify specific issues we need to fix as we execute the plan that we have in place. There's some more areas to address than we knew back when we did the plan and we've also accelerated the work on improving the accuracy of our regulatory reports and we increased the scope of this work as well. It's more comprehensive than originally planned.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "So, what we're doing, we're adding resources and data experts. We're learning from best practices and we're using some great AI and other data tools that are helping to identify anomalies in data and data flows much more quickly. We're also, to some of the culture side, we're learning from pilots how do we accelerate broader deployment at scale across the firm in a consistent enterprise-wide manner. So, all of these things in the data side are going to enable us to leapfrog competitors, more revenue opportunities, better client service, fewer buffers, drive more efficiencies and hope at the end – the end goal here is it becomes a competitive advantage for the firm. That is the data plan.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Clearly, there's a very important element of it related to the consent orders. We're behind in a few areas. We're investing. We've already begun that investment, as Mark and I've talked about, to get it done. We'll get it done.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Yeah, just to say real short follow-up to that. So you're doing all this great stuff, but you still fell short, just in like one sentence, despite doing all of this great stuff that you described, the regulator still said you didn't get it done. Why, after doing all that, didn't you get it done in the eyes of the regulators and why will it be fixed now? Just like a one sentence explanation for that if you have it.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "I always said that a transformation of this magnitude over multiple years would not be linear. We have many steps forward. We have setbacks. We adjust, we learn from them, we move forward and we get back on track.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "And Mike, if I could just put one number into context because you played back the 11,000, which was a number of global regulatory reports across the landscape here. There are probably 15 to 30 that are core US reports that are pivotal to our US regulators and a lot of what we're discussing here is about ensuring that we're prioritizing the data that impacts those 15 to 30 reports as we work through this.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Transformation remains our number one priority. We are deep into the large body of work of automating manual controls and processes, consolidating fragmented tech platforms, and upgrading our data architecture. We are committed to doing this the right way, knowing that it will take time to meet our regulators expectations and to deliver a modern, more efficient infrastructure.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "As we said last quarter, our Transformation and technology investments span the following themes: Platform and process simplification, Security and infrastructure modernization, Client experience enhancements, and data improvements.\n",

      "This quarter we closed another long-standing consent order which related to the effectiveness of our anti-money laundering systems.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",

      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "As we’ve said before, we will continue to increase our investments to address data governance and data quality related to regulatory reporting and are committed to spending whatever is necessary to address these areas and the Transformation more broadly.\n",

      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Will there be headwinds? Yes. There will be, the transformation is a multiyear process.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "We now have a flatter organization with greater accountability and as Mark talked about through the investments in our transformation, we're focused on simplifying our operational model, modernizing our infrastructure risk and controls and all of that reduces risk as we go.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "We're well on the way in executing the transformation plans. We've made meaningful progress as was acknowledged publicly by one of our regulators and it's a wide range book of work.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "We've made significant strides in areas such as risk management, compliance and accountability and that's well beyond the big bodies of work about consolidating our platforms.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "A huge body of work reducing risk and high risk processes such as payments and Markets through systemic preventative controls.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "We've been implementing the XiNG platform, this is the strategic cloud solution for market risk analytics. Values trades on demand and at scale.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "I was very pleased that we closed the FRB, AML/BSA consent order particularly given heightened risk and scrutiny in this area.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "That is the third consent order we've closed since 2021 and we've been very transparent.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "So, just one follow-up. When, and you do have the amended consent order that's not new anymore, but is this a problem with your dealing with clients or is this an issue with giving the regulators the information that they need?\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "We are working closely with our regulators. We incorporate their feedback as well as our own lessons learned.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "If we fall behind in an element of the consent orders but do understand the breadth of the consent order work as I laid out and the meaningful progress we're making across multiple areas, and when we fall behind in an area we increase the investments needed and look at any lessons learned in the approach and address it.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "So again, we don't have – we're not talking about issues as it relates to client information, client data, client reporting.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "We're not talking about information as it relates to financials. We're talking about regulatory reporting, all right.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "And regulatory reporting as I've mentioned in prior calls, we're a global firm. We've got over 11,000 regulatory reports and we're talking about ensuring that the data that we capture at trade entry is the data that's required to ultimately show up on these various regulatory reports in the way that we need it ensuring that we've got the proper controls on that front end so we don't have to do a lot of the reconciliation and manual adjustments to that data in order to get it how we needed in the report and ensuring we have standardized rules and controls around that process so that we can do it as efficiently as possible.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "But this is largely around ensuring that we improve those regulatory reports that we have to produce by starting with the underlying data that's required to do that.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "We are in the very final stages and are working with our clients to prepare them for this switchover later on in Q4.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "So the implications of what we're doing is as I've laid out, we've increased investments in the areas where we were behind, particularly in the data related to our regulatory processes and regulatory reporting.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "I see. Okay. That's super helpful. We just haven't had that many of these, so that's helpful.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "So it's just even the amended consent order was surprising because you have taken so many efforts and if you should have had an amended consent order or other actions, they probably should have been in place one, five, 10 or literally 20 years ago. And so that's just confusing on the outside.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "So let me break it down to a couple of pieces. So I start off just remind everyone the consent orders are very, very broad and the action that was taken was because we're behind in a narrower area which is the data particularly regarding our regulatory reporting where we're behind is the main area of focus.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "So this is – and we are going to make – we have made some changes to our approach and those changes relate to how we get after resolving data issues that are identified ensuring that there's engagement from the front end business, from the functions that are most relevant and that there's consideration for what's required on reg reporting in order for us to get that process streamlined and correct.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "And that is in fact what the resource review plan was that was in the amended consent order. It was basically a statement saying that you need to ensure that you have sufficient resources and that they're allocated towards achieving the timely and sustainable compliance.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "And so part of our process is in fact that. Taking a regular review of what is on track in the way of our milestones and deliverables where we see things that are being delayed or going red, what is the underlying root cause for why.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "And so your question is spot-on. The answer is that in many instances it will be a little bit of both, but importantly our processes include that type of analysis and assessment so that we can get after the execution on this in an effective way. I hope that helps.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "The modernization of our tech infrastructure is proceeding at pace allowing us to deliver new capabilities to our clients.  During the year, we consolidated trading and reporting platforms, and retired 6% of our legacy applications for the second year in a row.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "We've done this while investing and I think this is another difference. We've invested heavily in our transformation. And while that was catalyzed by our consent orders, these investments will ultimately deliver benefits from automation, from well-governed data, from consolidated platforms. We also have made significant investments in our business to support the 4% to 5% revenue growth and to ensure client momentum. And those investments have helped us expand our product suite, invest in digital capabilities, automate our processes, capture synergies through the client organization.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "And the types of benefits we're seeing. This is the second year in a row that we've retired 6% of our legacy platform base. And you've heard me talking about moving 20 of our cash equity platforms on to 1, 6 reporting ledgers on to 1, 11 sanctioned platforms on to 1. So we start seeing some of the benefits of those come in.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "The investments we’re making to modernize our infrastructure, streamline processes and automate controls are changing how we run the bank. We consolidated our balance sheet reporting to one unified ledger.   We implemented a cloud-based solution for risk analytics to better value trading assets. We have closed out three long-standing consent orders. Our capital, liquidity and reserves are robust.  Our focused strategy, simpler structure and targeted client selection have all reduced our risk profile significantly.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "We have made considerable progress on our Transformation.  While there are areas that are more advanced, there are others where we still have a lot more work to do, particularly around data and regulatory reporting, as last summer’s regulatory actions reinforced. We have reviewed the entire data program and made changes to its governance and structure as well as increased the level of investment.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "The second priority, Transformation. I've got to tell you, I'm broadly pleased with the progress we've made in risk and compliance and accountability. Kind of excited by the work we've got going on in controls for the business as well at the moment. We've been very transparent. Data is an area we have more work to do in. We increased our investments last year, as you know. And then as part of the annual planning process, we took a big step back to reassess our plan. And I decided, along with Mark and the management team, we needed to expand the scope and accelerate some of the work to satisfy our regulators' expectations.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Well, if I jump in, I feel very confident indeed that we know what we need to do. We know what we need to be spending on. Through the annual planning process that that concluded last month, it was clear we did need to invest more. We increased the scope of some of the work on the data front. We brought some other work forward. We looked at what we needed to do on the technology front and some of the critical investments. So this is pretty forensic and when we're looking at Transformation, we're looking at technology, we know what our target states need to be, and we know what we need to do to get there and the outcomes we need to be delivering.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Whether ultimately it works out or not, well, you could second-guess that when it happens. But the fact is, I think people want to help the system.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Thank you. So you talked about in your letter about regulators avoiding the knee-jerk reaction, which you addressed earlier.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Yeah. I think there's a deep recognition of the flaws in the system, and there should be, and fortunately, they're going to take a good look at it.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "And I think some of the – and Mike Mayo mentioned the bit about regulation. He is right. There will be reductions in cost because rules and regulations will be modified a little bit. I mean we – I pointed out resolution/recovery, which is a complete waste of time, is 80,000 pages long. Okay. It will never happen that way. CCAR, which is virtually a waste of time, is 20,000 pages long. Okay. We report 1 trillion – I think it's 1 trillion bits of data every day or something like that to the – all the various regulators and stuff like that. There is this excessive cost built up that we – that hopefully we can get rid of and will reduce the cost of the system and – but it's not the new branches, so.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Systems integration is also proceeding apace and we are targeting being substantially complete by mid-2024.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "And if the repricing is not successful, then in some cases we will have to remix and that means getting out of certain products and services.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "But I think more broadly on benchmarking ourselves to low-cost providers, it sort of speaks to an area that you've been interested in for a long time which is all of the investment that we're doing in technology to improve generally scalability and get more of our cost base to be variable versus fixed in terms of how we respond to volumes – that's a big part of the reason that we're doing the investments that we're doing, and modernization and cloud and AI and all the type of stuff that we've talked about a lot.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Yeah. So, I'm not going to comment about any conversations with the Fed – not to confirm or deny that they even exist. That stuff is private.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "So, I think the larger point is just that, a little bit to your question, there are a number of tools in the toolkit and they're really the same tools that are part of our capital hierarchy. So, first and foremost, we're looking to deploy the capital into organic or inorganic growth.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "But AI is an extraordinarily good tool to use. We just put a woman who's running it at our table. So it's data analytics, AI, et cetera. And there are multiple types of AI.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "So we use AI for risk, fraud, marketing, prospecting. And the management team's getting better and better at saying how can we use the data to do a better job to reduce errors, to serve clients better, to have a salesperson have co-pilots so they know to widen the client's coin or something like that.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "I think I won't speak for the industry bodies that were the actual litigants, but it seems to me, if you just read what they said publicly in their press releases, this is as much as anything about preserving rights in light of the statute of limitations deadlines that were coming up. So, let's just hope that we see some significant progress on that front.\n",

      "Now, turning to how we performed during the quarter… We reported net income of $4.6 billion and an EPS of $2.19. We had good revenue growth of 6% ex-divestitures and both revenue and expenses were in line with our guidance. Our ROTCE of nearly 11% benefitted from the closing of the sales of our consumer businesses in India and Vietnam and would have been over 9% without those gains.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Within Markets, our Fixed Income revenues were up 4% from a year ago. We benefitted from excellent performance in Rates and continued engagement from our corporate clients. The first quarter of 2022 was no slouch, as you may recall, but this quarter was our third-best in a decade. Equities was weaker however - down markedly in both derivatives and cash, but still had revenues north of $1 billion.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "In US Personal Banking, our cards businesses gained momentum as all drivers continue to normalize to pre-COVID levels. Branded Cards and Retail Services saw revenues up 18% and 24% respectively. Retail Banking saw some growth as we continue to see good momentum in mortgages and installment lending and also experienced a significant increase in digital deposits.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Finally, we remain confident about the prospects of our Wealth business. Despite the challenging headwinds, growth in Citigold accounts, client acquisition and client advisors were all solid and we expect these drivers to flow through to revenue later this year and beyond. We also saw the early signs of a long-awaited Asian recovery.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "On slide 4, we show financial results for the full firm. In the first quarter, we reported net income of approximately $4.6 billion and an EPS of $2.19 and a RoTCE of nearly 11% on $21.4 billion of revenues. Embedded in these results are pre-tax divestiture-related impacts of approximately $950 million, largely driven by the gain on sale of the India consumer business. Excluding these items, EPS was $1.86 with an RoTCE of over 9%.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "In the quarter, total revenues increased by 12% on a reported basis and increased 6% excluding divestiture-related impacts as strength across Services, Fixed Income and .S Personal Banking was partially offset by declines in Investment Banking, Equity Markets and Wealth, as well as the revenue reduction from the closed exits and wind-downs.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "On Slide 5, we show an expense walk for the first quarter, with the key underlying drivers. Transformation investments drove ~1% of the growth largely in the data, finance and risk and control programs. And 4% of the increase is driven by structural, largely in the form of compensation and benefits including the full-year impact of the people we hired last year as well as those we hired in the first quarter.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Embedded in this structural bucket are a few key items. First, other risk and control investments that are enterprise wide and in the businesses make up about 2% of the total expense increase. Second, the impact of additional front and back-office hires. Third, inflation and severance costs. All of this was partially offset by productivity savings as well as the benefit from foreign exchange translation and the expense reduction from the exits and across the firm, technology-related expenses grew 12%.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "On slide 7, we show net interest income, deposits, and loans where I’ll speak to sequential variances. In the first quarter, net interest income increased by approximately $80 million, largely driven by interest-earning balances in cards. Average loans were up slightly as growth in PBWM was largely offset by a decline in ICG. Average deposits were also up slightly, driven by growth in both PBWM and ICG. And our net interest margin increased 2 basis points.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "On Slide 11, we show the results for our Institutional Clients Group for the first quarter. Revenues were up 1% this quarter, largely driven by Services and Fixed income, mostly offset by Investment Banking and Equities. Expenses increased 4%, driven by transformation, other risk and control investments and volume-related expenses, partially offset by FX translation and productivity savings.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "In Securities Services, revenues grew 23% as net interest income grew 94%, driven by higher interest rates across currencies, partially offset by a 6% decrease in non-interest revenue due to the impact of market valuations. We are pleased with the execution in Securities Services as we continue to onboard assets under custody and administration from significant client wins and we feel very good about the pipeline of new deals. As a reminder, the Services businesses are central to our strategy and are two of our higher-returning businesses with strong linkages across the firm.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Markets revenues were down 4% as growth in Fixed Income was more than offset by Equities. Fixed Income revenues were up 4%, relative to a very strong quarter last year, as strength in our Rates franchise was partially offset by a decline in FX and Commodities. Equities revenues were down 25%, also relative to a strong quarter last year, primarily reflecting reduced client activity in Cash and Equity Derivatives. Corporate client flows remained strong and stable and we continued to make solid progress on our revenue-to-RWA target\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Now turning to Slide 13, we show the results for our Personal Banking & Wealth Management business. Revenues were up 9%, driven by net interest income growth of 10%, partially offset by a 1% decline in non-interest revenue, driven by lower investment product revenues in Wealth.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Expenses were also up 9%, predominantly driven by investments in transformation and other risk and control initiatives.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Wealth revenues were down 9%, driven by continued investment fee headwinds and higher deposit costs particularly in the Private Bank. However, we did see notable improvement in revenues in Asia which were up approximately 20% on a sequential basis.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "On Slide 16, we show results for Corporate Other for the first quarter. Revenues increased, largely driven by higher net revenue from the investment portfolio. Expenses increased, driven by transformation and other risk and control investments, partially offset by a reduction in consulting fees.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Why don't I start, and then, Jane, feel free to jump in. Look, we saw better performance in the quarter in Markets than when I talked at the conference earlier in the quarter. And really that played through in our Fixed Income business which was up about 4% year-over-year driven largely by strength in Rates and we saw rate volatility in the back end of the quarter and we were well-positioned to take advantage of that and serve clients and that aided getting us to down 4% in aggregate across Markets.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "So a couple things I mentioned. So one, we did see inflows in the quarter associated with some of the sector turmoil. We've looked at kind of deposit levels from call it March 7th, March 8th through close to the end of March, and we certainly did see an uptick, call it probably a little bit under $30 billion or so of inflows in that period of time, with a good portion of that in our CCB, our Commercial Middle-Market client base.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "And that was both in the Institutional business that we saw the inflows as well as in PBWM.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "As a result of all these combined steps, which include the simplification, we are eliminating approximately 7,000 positions which will generate $1.5 billion of annualized run-rate expense saves. The combination of these actions and the measures we are taking to eliminate our remaining stranded costs will drive $2 to $2.5 billion in cumulative annualized run-rate saves in the medium term.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Turning to the quarter, we had a good start to a pivotal year. We reported net income of approximately $3.4 billion, EPS of $1.58 and an RoTCE of 7.6% on over $21 billion of revenues. Our revenues were up over 3% year-over-year, excluding divestitures, which was primarily the billion-dollar gain from the India consumer sale last year. Our expenses were slightly down quarter-over-quarter, excluding the FDIC special assessments.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Services continues to perform well and generate very attractive returns. Revenue was up 8% for the quarter as both businesses won new mandates and deepened relationships with existing clients.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Markets bounced back from a tough final quarter in ’23. While revenues were down 7% as lower volatility impacted Rates and Currencies, that was off a very strong first quarter last year. We saw good client activity in Equities and in Spread Products, where both new issuance and securitization activity were particularly robust. We fully integrated our Financing and Securitization capabilities within our Markets business and we started to see the benefits of having a unified spread product offering for our clients.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Our strong performance in both DCM and ECM drove Investment Banking revenue growth of 35% and overall Banking revenue growth of 49%. While M&A revenues are still low across the street, I was pleased that we participated in some of the significant deals announced in the quarter, such as Diamondback’s merger with Endeavor Energy and Catalent’s merger with Nova Holdings.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "In Wealth, while revenues were down in the quarter, we grew fees and gathered an estimated $22 billion of net new assets over the past 12 months. As you have seen, Andy continues to form his team and is focused on three areas: first, rationalizing the expense base, second, turning on the growth engine by focusing on investment revenues, and third, enhancing our platforms and capabilities to elevate the client experience.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "On slide 6, we show financial results for the full firm. In the first quarter, we reported net income of approximately $3.4 billion, EPS of $1.58 and an RoTCE of 7.6% on $21.1 billion of revenues. Total revenues were down 2% on a reported basis. Excluding divestiture-related impacts, largely consisting of the $1 billion gain from the sale of the India consumer business in the prior year, revenues were up more than 3%, driven by growth across Banking, USPB and Services, partially offset by declines in Markets and Wealth. Expenses were $14.2 billion, up 7%, on a reported basis. Excluding divestiture-related impacts and the incremental FDIC special assessment, expenses were up 5%. Cost of credit was approximately $2.4 billion, primarily driven by higher Card net credit losses, which were partially offset by ACL releases in Wealth, Banking and Legacy Franchises. At the end of the quarter, we had nearly $22 billion in total reserves with a reserve-to-funded loans ratio of approximately 2.8%.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "On slide 13, we show the results for Markets for the first quarter. Markets revenues were down 7% as lower Fixed Income revenues more than offset growth in Equities. Fixed Income revenues decreased 10%, driven by Rates and Currencies, which were down 21%, on the back of lower volatility and a strong quarter in the prior year. This was partially offset by strength in Spread Products and Other Fixed Income, which was up 26% driven by an increase in client activity, particularly in asset-backed lending. And we continued to see good underlying momentum in Equities, with revenues up 5%, driven by growth across cash trading and equity derivatives. And we continued to make progress in prime with balances up more than 10%.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "On slide 14, we show the results for Banking for the first quarter. Banking revenues increased 49%, driven by growth in Investment banking and Corporate Lending and lower losses on loan hedges. As I previously mentioned, Corporate Lending results include the impact of revenue sharing from Investment Banking, Services and Markets.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Investment Banking revenues increased 35%, driven by DCM and ECM as improved market sentiment led to an increase in issuance activity, particularly Investment Grade, which is running at near-record levels. Advisory revenues declined given the low level of announced merger activity last year. However, in the quarter we participated in the pickup in announced M&A across sectors, including those where we’ve been investing such as Technology and Healthcare.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Corporate Lending revenues, excluding mark-to-market on loan hedges, increased 34%, largely driven by higher revenue share. We generated positive operating leverage this quarter as expenses decreased 4%, driven by actions taken to right size the expense base. Cost of credit was a benefit of $129 million, primarily driven by changes in portfolio composition. The NCL rate was 0.3% of average loans, and we ended the quarter with a reserve-to-funded loan ratio of 1.5%. Net income was approximately $536 million. Average loans decreased 6% as we maintained strict discipline around capital efficiency, as we optimize Corporate loan balances. RoTCE was 9.9% for the quarter, reflecting a rebound in activity, reserve releases and continued expense discipline.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "On slide 16, we show the results for US Personal Banking for the first quarter. US Personal Banking revenues increased 10%, driven by NII growth of 8% and lower partner payments.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "This morning, we reported net income of $4.1 billion and earnings per share of $1.96 with an RoTCE of 9.1%.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "The three most significant Fixed Income businesses – Rates, Spread Products and FX – each contributed to an overall 8% increase over last year.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "And in a good macro quarter for Equities, we were up 23% as we continued with our long-term strategy to augment our high derivatives share with a larger prime business.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Banking was up 12%, as we continue to gain share in Investment Banking across most industry sectors.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Turning to Wealth, all three businesses contributed to overall growth of 24% and fee revenue drove non-interest revenue growth of 16%.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "We remain focused on capturing assets our clients have “off” us as demonstrated by the roughly 11% organic growth in client investment assets.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "In the U.S. for example, regulation and tax policy are all likely to look different in a year’s time.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "This quarter we reported net income of $4.1 billion, EPS of $1.96 and an RoTCE of 9.1% on $21.6 billion of revenues, generating positive operating leverage for the firm and in each of our five businesses.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "And total Markets revenues were up 12%.\n",

      "As we look at this quarter, expenses declined by 5%, which included a favorable FX impact.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Markets revenues were up 12%, driven by growth across both Fixed Income and Equities.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Fixed Income revenues increased 8%, with Rates and Currencies up 9%, reflecting increased client activity and monetization.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "And Spread Products and Other Fixed Income, up 7%, driven by higher client activity and loan growth.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Equities revenues increased 23%, primarily driven by Equity Derivatives, on increased market volatility and higher client activity, and momentum in Prime Services, with Prime balances up approximately 16%.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "M&A was up 84%, as we gained share overall and across numerous sectors.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Corporate Lending revenues, excluding mark-to-market on loan hedges, declined 1%, as increases in revenue share were more than offset by the combined impact of lower loan balances and higher recoveries in the prior year.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Expenses declined 12%, largely driven by lower compensation, as we see the benefits of our prior actions to right-size the workforce and expense base.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "This includes net new investment assets of $16.5 billion in the quarter and over $56 billion in the last 12 months, representing approximately 11% organic growth.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "End-of-period client balances increased 7%, driven by higher net new investment asset flows and market valuations.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "On slide 14, we show the results for U.S. Personal Banking in the first quarter. U.S. Personal Banking revenues were up 2%, driven by growth in Branded Cards and Retail Banking, largely offset by a decline in Retail Services.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Revenues declined 39%, with declines across both Corporate/Other and Legacy Franchises.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "It does have an impact on the Retail Services print that we have in the quarter and more importantly, the year-over-year that you see there of down 11% because, as you know, we share profits with those partners. And so that that that down 11% we see in the quarter is informed by last year where we had an assumption that the late fee rule was going to come into play and therefore, we had less profit to share with our partners versus this year first quarter where we've assumed it would not come into play and, therefore, have more profits to share with our partners. And so important to point that out on Retail Services, which jumps out in USPB, that it's unlikely that we see that downward percentage in the remaining quarters because it's really a byproduct of what we assumed last year. versus this year on late fees.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Hi Jane, Hi Mark. Mark, you touched on in your opening comments about the seasonal increase in trading-related assets. And then the growth was very strong. Was there any types of strategies that you guys employed? Because when you go back in other seasonal periods, first quarter of prior years, we've not seen this kind of growth. So, what led to this kind of success of growing your trading assets so well this quarter?\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "I was just rounding down.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Today we reported net income of $2.9 billion and an EPS of $1.33. Our revenues ex-divestitures are relatively flat to last year and we remain on track to meet our revenue guidance of $78-79 billion for the year.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Securities Services revenues were also up 15%, driven by higher interest rates across currencies. We are really pleased with execution in this business as we continue to bring in new assets under custody and administration, which are up by approximately $2.4 trillion in the last year. And we have gained 100 basis points in share year-over-year as a result of the investments we have been making2.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Markets revenues were down 13%, compared to an exceptionally strong second quarter last year. From early April, clients stood on the sidelines as the debt ceiling played out and we continued to experience very low levels of volatility throughout the quarter. Despite this, our corporate client flows remained strong, and we achieved our medium-term revenue-to-RWA target again this quarter.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "In Banking, the momentum in investment grade debt has spread into other DCM products. But the long-awaited rebound in Investment Banking has yet to materialize, and it was a disappointing quarter in terms of both the wallet and our own performance with Investment Banking revenues down 24%. We continue to right-size the business to the environment whilst making investments in selected areas such as Technology and Healthcare.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Let me end with capital. You won’t be shocked to hear that we were disappointed with the increase to our Stress Capital Buffer. We have engaged in active dialogue with the Fed to better understand the differences between our model and theirs in terms of Non-Interest Revenue.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "On slide 4, we show financial results for the full firm. In the second quarter, we reported net income of approximately $2.9 billion and an EPS of $1.33 and an RoTCE of 6.4% on $19.4 billion of revenues.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Embedded in these results are after-tax divestiture-related impacts of approximately $(92) million. Excluding these items, EPS was $1.37 with an RoTCE of 6.6%.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Our effective tax rate this quarter was 27%, primarily driven by the geographic mix of our pre-tax earnings in the quarter. Excluding current quarter divestiture-related impacts, our effective tax rate was 26%.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Severance in the quarter was approximately $200 million, and $450 million year-to-date, as we took further actions across Investment Banking, Markets and the Functions.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Expenses increased 13%, primarily driven by continued investments in TTS and risk and controls, as well as approximately $120 million of severance in Investment Banking and Markets, partially offset by productivity savings.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "In Securities Services, revenues were also up 15%, driven by higher net interest income across currencies.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "We are pleased with the progress in Securities Services as we continue to onboard assets under custody and administration, which are up approximately 11% or $2.4 trillion dollars And we feel very good about the pipeline of new deals in Securities Services As a reminder, the Services businesses are central to our strategy and are two of our higher-returning businesses with strong synergies across the firm.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",

      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Fixed Income revenues were down 13%, as strength in our Rates franchise was more than offset by a decline in Currencies and Commodities.\n",

      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",

      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Expenses decreased 2%, primarily driven by closed consumer exits and wind-downs. Excluding divestiture-related impacts, expenses decreased 8%.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "And we now expect the full-year tax rate to be approximately 25%, excluding discrete items and divestiture-related impacts.\n",

      "And our effective tax rate for the quarter should be approximately 25%, excluding discrete items and divestiture-related impacts.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "I'd highlight a couple of things that I'm sure are obvious to you, Betsy. One is this is the stress capital buffer for the 12-month period starting October 1. And two is the strategy that we've described and talked about and have started to execute against is intentionally designed to help morph the business towards a more steady, predictable, consistent stream of revenues, fee revenue growth as well bring our expenses down over time, and exit these markets, and those things should contribute to reducing our stress capital buffer over time and improving our returns. But the answer to your question very directly is, yes, the 13.3% would reflect where we'd be targeting as of October 1 for now.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Well, Mike, you know I love you, but I'm not going to play that game. What I will say is that we clearly have work that we're doing as it relates to the exits, but making very good progress on that, not just on the closing of the exits but also on putting a dent in the stranded costs associated with those exits that we have closed.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Now, turning to what was another good quarter, our results show the relentless focus we have in executing our strategy as we continue to drive towards our medium-term return targets. We reported net income of $3.2 billion with an earnings per share of $1.52 and an ROTCE of 7.2%.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Revenues were up 4% overall, as well as up in each of our five core businesses, where all but one had positive operating leverage. Expenses were down 2% year-over-year. The steps we are taking to simplify our organization, right-size businesses such as Markets and Wealth, and reduce stranded costs are beginning to take hold, even as we increase investment in our Transformation.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Over the medium term, we expect these simplification and stranded cost actions to drive the $2 to $2.5 billion in annual run-rate saves.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Banking was up 38% as the wallet rebound gained some momentum and we again grew share. Our clients continued to access the debt capital markets with investment grade issuance near record levels. Equity issuance increased, particularly in convertibles, as companies wait for a fuller opening of the IPO window. Investment Banking fees were up 63% versus the prior year.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Wealth is starting to improve. Growth in client investment assets drove stronger Investment revenue, especially in Citigold, and was up a preliminary 15%.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "U.S. Personal Banking saw revenue growth of 6%, with all three businesses again contributing to the topline. There was good revolving balance and loan growth in both branded cards and retail services. We continue to see differentiation in the credit segments with the lower income customers seeing pressure.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "On slide 6, we show financial results for the full firm. For the quarter, we reported net income of approximately $3.2 billion, EPS of $1.52 and an RoTCE of 7.2% on $20.1 billion of revenues. Total revenues were up 4%, driven by growth across all businesses as well as an approximate $400 million gain related to the Visa B exchange offer. A significant portion of this gain is reflected in Equity Markets, with the remainder reflected in All Other.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "The underlying growth in both businesses is a result of our continued investments in product innovation, client experience and platform modernization that we highlighted during our Services Investor Day last month. Expenses increased 9%, largely driven by an Argentina-related transaction tax expense, a legal settlement expense and continued investments in product innovation and technology. Cost of credit was a benefit of $27 million, driven by an ACL release in the quarter.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "On slide 14, we show the results for Markets for the second quarter. Markets revenues were up 6%. Fixed Income revenues decreased 3%, driven by Rates and Currencies, which were down 11% on the back of lower volatility and tighter spreads. This was partially offset by strength in Spread Products and Other Fixed Income, which was up 20% primarily driven by continued loan growth and higher securitization and underwriting fees.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "And in Advisory, we are seeing revenues from the relatively low announced activity in 2023 coming to fruition as those transactions close. Both year-to-date and in the quarter, we gained share across DCM, ECM and Advisory, particularly in Technology where we’ve been investing.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Corporate Lending revenues, excluding mark-to-market on loan hedges, increased 7%, largely driven by higher revenue share. We generated positive operating leverage again this quarter as expenses decreased 10%, primarily driven by actions taken to right size the expense base.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "On slide 17, we show the results for US Personal Banking for the second quarter. US Personal Banking revenues increased 6%, driven by NII growth of 5% and lower partner payments. Branded Cards revenues increased 8%, driven by interest-earning balance growth of 9% as payment rates continue to moderate. And we continue to see growth in spend volumes up 3%, primarily driven by customers with FICO scores of 740 or higher.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "That's helpful. And maybe just quickly, kind of a similar question on expenses. Better-than-expected this quarter, but there was no restructuring or repositioning charges. I think to get to the high end of your range, you'd have to be up a little bit in the back half from 2Q run rate. Is that because you expect more repositioning, restructuring in the second half or maybe just talk through expense trajectory from here?\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Yeah, so that's right. When I talk about it at the first quarter, I talked about kind of a downward trend for each of the quarters after Q1. The second quarter came in a bit lower than we were expecting. I'm sticking with the guidance and it does mean that the back half of the year will likely come in – will come in higher than the second quarter. That's a combination of a couple of things, including the pace of hiring and investment that we will do in the transformation work that has to be done. It also includes repositioning charges that we might take or need to take as we continue to work through our businesses across the firm and the franchise and then the second quarter did or – yeah, the second quarter did have a one-time or so and some delayed spending that will pick up in the third and fourth quarter around advertising and marketing and some of the other line items. So, yes, the third and fourth quarter, the back half will be higher than the second quarter, but consistent with the guidance that I've given.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Turning to the quarter, today we reported net income of $3.5 billion, an EPS of $1.63 and an ROTCE of 7.7%. Our revenues were up 10% ex-divestitures and each of our five core, interconnected businesses posted revenue growth. We remain on track to meet the revenue and expense guidance we set for the year.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Securities Services had revenue growth of 16%, with some good underlying fee growth. We took share again and we have grown our AUC/AUA by over $2 trillion in the last year. This business has considerable momentum and a strong pipeline of clients who are benefitting from the cloud and data investments we are making.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Markets was up 10% year-over-year on the back of Rates & Currencies having the best third quarter in 10 years and Commodities grew nicely. This was partially offset by Equities which was down slightly. Despite this we continue to see good momentum in cash and we have grown prime balances year to date.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Wealth revenues have stabilized and were up slightly. Most notably Investment revenues picked up across our geographies. The drivers for the franchise - such as referrals, client acquisition, and net new inflows - were all quite strong around the world.

      "Embedded in these results are divestiture-related impacts of approximately $214 million, after-tax, primarily driven by the Taiwan consumer business sale. Excluding these items, EPS was $1.52 with an RoTCE of 7.2%.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "On slide 5, we show expense drivers for the third quarter as well as our key investment themes. Expenses were up 6% and our level of expenses continue to be driven by a number of factors, including: Investments in Transformation as well as risk and controls, Business-led and enterprise-led investments Macro factors, including inflation and FX, Severance, which was approximately $190 million in the quarter and roughly $640 million on a year-to-date basis. This included actions across Banking, Markets, Wealth and the functions. And all of this was partially offset by productivity savings and expense reductions from the closed exits and wind-downs.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "On slide 6, we show net interest income, deposits, and loans where I’ll speak to sequential variances. In the third quarter, net interest income decreased by $72 million. Excluding Markets, net interest income increased $332 million, primarily driven by: Growth in PBWM, as we continue to see loan growth and higher loan spreads, a pickup in Services driven by higher deposit spreads, as a result of higher interest rates and active beta management, partially offset by reductions from closed exits and wind-downs.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Expenses increased 10%, primarily driven by continued investments in risk and controls and volume-related expenses, partially offset by productivity savings.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Cost of credit was $196 million, including $51 million of net credit losses. This resulted in net income of approximately $2.4 billion, up 12%, driven by higher revenues, partially offset by higher expenses and higher cost of credit.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "In Securities Services, revenues were up 16%, driven by higher net interest income across currencies. Non-interest revenues were up 3%. We are very pleased with the progress we are seeing in Securities Services as we continue to onboard assets under custody and administration, which are up approximately 10% or $2.1 trillion Markets revenues were up 10%, driven by Fixed Income.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Fixed Income revenues were up 14%, largely driven by strength in our Rates and Currencies franchise. While volatility remained subdued versus a year ago, we did see overall volatility tick higher relative to the beginning of the quarter Equities revenues were down 3%, driven by a decline in Equity Derivatives, partially offset by growth in Cash and Prime. And we continued to make solid progress on our revenue-to-RWA target.\n",

      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Expenses were $13.3 billion, down 2%, largely driven by savings associated with our organizational simplification and stranded cost reductions, partially offset by volume related expenses and continued investments in the Transformation and other risk and control initiatives.\n",

      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "And at the same time, Andy continues to right-size our expense base and drive productivity. Our advisor productivity increased over 50% in Citigold North America.

      "Perfect. Thank you. And as a follow-up question, I'm sure it is frustrating for you to see the stock reaction in a quarter where you had PPNR strength and better expectations for net interest income in the fourth quarter.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Wealth, again, really strong performance this quarter with revenues up 9%. But look at the client investment assets, up 24%. The client balances up 14%. That's driving fee momentum and it's a keen area of focus for Andy and that team that he's pulled together and it's a real opportunity for us given the $5 trillion or so of assets that our clients hold away from us and we're better positioning ourselves to capture that.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",

In addition to resetting the expense base and ensuring the right utilization of our balance sheet, he is tightening our focus to build fee-based revenue streams and investment AUM.

      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Fixed Income revenues decreased by 25%, largely driven by rates and currencies on lower volatility and a significant slowdown in December as well as the impact of devaluation.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "However, we saw good underlying momentum in equities, with revenues up 9%, driven by gains across all products. And we continued to grow prime balances while making solid progress on our revenue-to-RWA target.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Corporate Lending revenues excluding mark-to-market on loan hedges decreased 26%, largely driven by lower revenue share from Investment Banking, Services and Markets.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Expenses increased 37%, primarily driven by the absence of an operational loss reserve release in the prior year. Excluding the reserve release, expenses were roughly flat.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "We’re seeing good momentum in non-interest revenue, which was up 13% in the fourth quarter, driven by higher investment assets, increased client activity and market performance.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Expenses were up 4%, primarily driven by investments in risk and controls and technology, partially offset by re-pacing strategic investments and tighter expense control as we begin to right size the expense base in the business.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Client investment assets were up 12%, driven by new acquisitions and the benefit from higher market valuations.\n",

      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Net income increased to $201 million, driven by higher revenues, partially offset by higher cost of credit. Average deposits decreased 5%, driven by the transfer of relationships and the associated deposits to our Wealth business.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "On slide 18, we show results for All Other on a managed basis, which includes Corporate Other and Legacy Franchises and excludes divestiture-related items. Revenues decreased 17%, driven by a decrease in NII of 29%, largely driven by the closed exits and wind-downs, partially offset by higher non-interest revenue.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",

      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Okay, perfect, thank you. And then, Mark, can you discuss for a second maybe, just broadly, the flow of expenses through the year? I know that they should begin to decline towards the end, but what happens between now and then? Do they hold kind of flattish with a core rate, or would there be any normal course of business growth?\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "I think what I'd say is that, you should expect it in the first quarter. We'd likely see an uptick in our total expenses relative to the fourth, in part because, as Jane has mentioned, we anticipate that there'll be more to the org simplification and, therefore, dollars associated with that in Q1. And then, from there, I would expect that you see a downward trend through the fourth quarter.\n",

      "Fixed Income revenues increased 37%, driven by Rates and Currencies, which were up 39%, and Spread Products and Other Fixed Income, up 30%, both reflecting increased client activity. Rates and Currencies also benefitted from a conducive trading environment, compared to a challenging prior year quarter. Spread Products and Other Fixed Income was driven by Credit and Mortgage Trading as well as higher securitization volumes.\n",

      "On slide 13, we show the results for Banking for the fourth quarter and full year. Banking revenues were up 27%, largely driven by Investment Banking, with fees up 35% as we saw growth across all products. DCM was driven by continued Investment Grade issuance momentum and increased Leveraged Finance activity. ECM saw strong issuance activity particularly in follow-on and convertible instruments.  In M&A, growth was driven by continued strong client engagement as well as the completion of previously announced acquisitions, given the more conducive macro environment. For the year, we gained share across regions, products and several sectors, including Healthcare and Technology.\n",

These last few quarters, you've just seen us on that march. And the number I'm most excited by, net new investment asset inflow of $42 billion, up 40% year-over-year. The strategy is working.

      "For the quarter, long-term net inflows were $34 billion, led by Equities and Fixed Income.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Finally, you may have noticed that our effective tax rate has increased this quarter and it will likely stay around 23% this year absent discrete items, which can vary quite a bit. The driver of this change is the firm's adoption of the proportional amortization method for certain tax equity investments. Our managed rate is unchanged and it should average about 3.5% above the effective tax rate. This is a smaller gap than we previously observed and we expect this approximate relationship to persist going forward although the difference will continue to fluctuate as it has in the past.\n",

      "And so, you're asking a pertinent question. So, we're earning a lot of money. Our capital cup runneth over, and that's why we've increased the dividend. And if you're asking me what we'd like to do is to pay out something like a third, a third of normalized earnings. Of course, it's hard to calculate always what normalized earnings are, but we don't mind being a little bit ahead of that sometimes, a little bit behind that sometimes.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Yeah. Really good question. I would say, in general, that the sort of volatility and uncertainty in the rate environment overall on balance is actually supportive for the Markets revenue pool. And I think that, together with generally more balance sheet deployment as well as sort of some level of natural background growth, is one of the reasons that the overall level of Markets revenue has stabilized at meaningfully above what was normal in the pre-pandemic period.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Thank you. Your commentary with Ken's questions were great and clear on Investment Banking for the near term in this year. I have a bigger picture question in terms of, you're always so good in spelling out where you're over-earning. Do you feel like you're under-earning on the Investment Banking side? And I just use some of your own numbers from the past of like, the market has added like $40 trillion of equity market cap and $40 trillion of fixed income market cap last 10 years, yet the wallet is like 20% plus below the 10-year average. So, is there just a bigger upside and it's just a matter of when, not if.\n",

So, I guess one thing to say, right, is that we did have a sequential increase in NII this quarter and, as you may recall, at Investor Day, I said that there was some chance that we would see sequential increases followed by sequential declines and that people should avoid kind of drawing the conclusion that we'd hit the trough when that happens. So that's essentially exactly what we're seeing now.\n",

      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "The other thing is that we have continued to execute on our growth strategies this year so there's a not insignificant amount of annualization. You can't quite see that in the fourth quarter numbers because of the seasonality of incentive comp., but if you were to strip that out, you would see probably some sequential increases and so annualization as an additional headwind.\n",

      "Thank you, Jenn, hello to everyone joining us today. Well, 2023 is shaping up to be another interesting year, given the tumultuous events of the last few weeks. I am going to share some observations, and then we'll turn to what was a good quarter.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "And it is also thanks to our people. I want to express my pride in our colleagues around the world who have worked tirelessly last month to serve clients as they turned to Citi as a port in the storm.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "We made some significant leadership announcements. I am delighted that Andy Sieg will join Citi at my table as the new head of Wealth Management. Andy is a widely respected leader in this space and comes to us after running an $18 billion business with $2.8 trillion in client balances. He is the latest and the most visible example of the excellent talent we have attracted over the last couple of years.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Thank you, Jane, and good morning, everyone. I am going to start with the Firmwide financial results, focusing on year-over-year comparisons for the first quarter unless I indicate otherwise, and spend a little more time on expenses, our balance sheet and capital. Then I will turn to the results of each segment.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "We recognize these investments have driven a significant increase in expenses, but they are crucial to modernize the firm, address the consent orders and position Citi for success in the years to come.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "We are driving the strategy by investing in the client experience both in terms of our technology interface and innovative new products. We launched our cloud-based instant payments platform for eCommerce clients in TTS. We are also deploying CitiDirect Commercial Banking, our mobile and digital interface for Commercial clients so they too can open accounts and access all products and services across ICG in the same way our Large Corporate clients do.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "And this deployment is also linked to our strategy – we use our resources to lend and transact with our clients in ways that deepen the relationship and drive returns for our shareholders while maintaining strong liquidity and capital.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "While the environment continues to remain challenging for Wealth, we are seeing strong underlying business drivers as we execute against our strategy.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Yeah, thanks, Glenn, and good morning. Appreciate the question. Look, we did have a very solid first quarter, but as Jane mentioned in her prepared remarks, there are a number of things that are still out there in the global macro environment that are uncertain and unclear, including, frankly, as we contemplate the direction of rates and what's required to tame inflation, let alone the uncertainty that we've seen in parts of the sector here through the quarter.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "We're not shifting our strategy in Wealth. His mandate is consistent with the strategy we laid out at Investor Day. We see a lot of potential of growth in Asia as we fill in the coverage across the full wealth spectrum there. We'll be scaling up in the US by building out the investment offering and cross-selling into our existing and new clients across the country. We see tremendous potential of growth in our Private Bank and the family office franchise really around the world, and there's a lot of synergies to be realized as we point out in the different KPIs and drivers between the other four core businesses in terms of referrals and other business that we're able to generate across the franchise.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "The only thing I'd add is that, we are, I think, well-positioned for as the market recovers and it plays towards Wealth. When you look at kind of the client advisors, as you know, we've been investing in bringing on new client advisors. We've been increasing the number of new clients that we've been onboarding as well. We've invested in some of the investment products that we have, and so I feel like we are positioning ourselves for when this turns.\n",

      "My first question is a follow-up to Betsy. I think everybody were certainly impressed, Jane, at the Andy Sieg hire, and clearly, he was running a much larger business than what Citi has today. And this is sort of a tricky question. Clearly, you're still working through some of the transformation. There's still a consent order, but given your strength as a global player, could Citi participate in perhaps inorganic opportunities that could be out there, having a result perhaps of the liquidity crisis that we saw that could potentially enhance your Wealth Management footprint more quickly?\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "We see plenty of potential for organic growth potential, and I think that's really where we're going to be focusing, Erika, because I look at the Private Bank and the family office, there is so much wealth creation supplemented by our Commercial Banking relationships with a lot of the enterprises and the owners of those enterprises who are really generating the new industry champions in country after country, and we're extremely well-positioned to capture that.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "I don't see an inorganic play that would actually help us on it. We also benefit because we don't have our own proprietary products and a sales force pushing those proprietary products. We're an open architecture, and therefore, we're a very desirable partner for many of our key partners on the Institutional side of the business to be able to provide very interesting value propositions, investment opportunities and the like to our clients around the world.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "And finally, we can see certainly areas in interesting digital plays, different partnerships, areas like that that are of interest. So I'll never say never in the longer-run. I'm sure if something very attractive comes up, we'll be very interested and looking at it, but it's not something right now that I think makes sense, given where we're focused. Actually almost independent of the consent orders, I think what we're looking at doing right now is getting this organic play right and then we'll see from there.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Hey, good morning. So I wanted to start off with a question just on the IB and trading outlook. On the trading side, just given some of the recent macro shocks, have you seen any evidence of bad volatility and are you still confident that you can sustain that mid-single-digit growth target? And just on the Investment Banking side, I wanted to see if there's any evidence of green shoots. It's been a challenging backdrop, as you noted, Mark, but I was hoping you could offer some color just across some of the different product lines, across M&A, ECM, DCM.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "What we talked about for the full year is kind of relatively flat performance, and I still think that based on what we see today and subject to how the macro continues to evolve that we'll be able to deliver on that. But as you know, volatility in many instances plays to the favor of Markets businesses, and so there's a bit of an unknown as to how that evolves. But I feel confident in the guidance that we've given thus far on that.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Yeah, I'd jump in before you turn to Banking as well. I think one of the differences with our franchise compared to some others is that we are the go-to bank for corporates, and that provides a highly attractive but pretty steady flow of activity. This is obviously in the volatile markets we've been seeing is from our perspective very good volatility because we're able to support our clients in rates, FX, commodity hedging, and it makes our risk flows much more diversified than our competitors particularly in volatile markets like this. We're not taking positions. This is really attractive client flow business right at the heart of the global network.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "The other piece that I think is important in the mix here too is just the partnership with TTS, cross-border payments, these other elements and cornerstone of the FX franchise, so there's some pieces here of the volatility that one doesn't usually think of this as being so client-heavy, but that's what's differentiating on the Citi franchise.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "The other thing I'd add is that we continue to have very good dialogue with clients as they manage through the environment and try to anticipate what the balance of the year looks like, and at some point, it's clear that clients are going to need to get back into the markets, but that trajectory is going to largely depend on the geopolitical and macro environment and how we all manage and navigate that uncertainty.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "So very engaged, healthy pipeline, but subject to how the environment continues to evolve.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "But I'd end with just one final point that Jane has made already, which is that the outcome that we choose will be the best outcome for our shareholders, our clients, and employees.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Yeah, look, again, look, the expense base is a key area of focus for us, right? We recognize that expenses have been growing. They've been growing because we've been investing in the franchise both transformation-wise as well as business-led growth to support the competitive advantages that we have in many of our franchises, but we're managing that very actively and very deliberately, and that means that we're looking to ensure that we're spending the money in the right way in the right places and that we're going to yield the benefits that we expect from that over time. And that was all factored into the targets that we set at our Investor Day for the medium-term, and what that requires is that we start bending the curve in 2024 as I stated and that we end in that medium-term at a place where we have an operating efficiency of about 60% and we're positioned to have returns that are in that 11% to 12% RoTCE point of view.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "There are a couple of factors that are going to contribute to lowering that expense base. One, the divestitures that we've been talking about, right. The second is the benefits from the transformation and other investments that I've just referenced. And the third is further organizational and management simplification efforts that we have underway that are enabled by the idea that we're exiting 14 consumer countries. And so those three factors, if you will, become very important to ensure that we get to that lower cost structure and that we're able to deliver on the broader commitments that we're making with regards to returns.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Yeah, year-end, early next year, yes. We're still kind of on track, on trend for that. Again, I'd expect that they pick up a little bit after that before they start tapering down. But the answer to your question, Ken, is yes. That's still the timeline, fourth quarter, early 2024 reaching those normalized levels.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "So no surprises in what happened.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Yes, that's what I was talking about, Mike, in terms of those flows. They did come largely in the US in the month of March, call it March 8th through kind of the end of March. They were overshadowed by these normal payments that I referenced, and we did, we still see good activity kind of even as we came through March and into early parts of April.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Yeah, I often say it takes a root canal to extract us from the operations of our clients just because of exactly what we're talking about here, and that's also we see it even with the mid-market clients that are a growing portion here as well because we're helping them expand internationally, and that stickiness comes through and the LCR of 120% is a very high-quality LCR ratio.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Thank you, Jenn, and good morning to everyone. Today I am going to touch on the macroeconomic environment before I update you on the progress we are making and then I’ll discuss the quarter.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "In Asia, Japan is joining India as a bright spot and China’s economy has gained some more traction, although its property market remains a concern.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Amidst all these dynamics, we continue to focus on executing against our strategy and delivering the best of Citi to all our stakeholders. I said 2024 will be a pivotal year for us as we put our business and organizational simplification largely behind us and we focus on two main priorities: the Transformation and the performance of our businesses and the firm.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Last month marked the end to the organizational simplification we announced in September. The result is a cleaner, simpler management structure that fully aligns to and facilitates our strategy. We are now more client-centric. We’re already seeing faster decision making and a nimbler organization at work. We have clear lines of accountability, starting with my management team, fewer layers, increased spans of control, and frankly much less bureaucracy and needless complexity.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "We also took a number of other steps to sharpen our business focus and improve returns by right placing businesses to better capture synergies; exiting certain businesses in Markets that just didn’t fit with our strategy; and right sizing the workforce in Wealth.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "We are keeping a close eye on the execution of these efforts and overall resourcing to ensure we safeguard our commitment to the Transformation. As you know, given its magnitude and scale, the Transformation is a multi-year effort to address issues that have spanned over two decades.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "We have made steady progress as we retire multiple legacy platforms, streamline end-to-end processes, and strengthen our risk and control environment. All of which are necessary, not only to meet the expectations of our regulators, but also to serve our clients more effectively.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "A transformation of this magnitude is never linear. So while we have made good progress in many areas, there are a few where we are intensifying our efforts, such as automating certain regulatory processes and the data related to regulatory reporting. We are committed to getting these right and will look to self-fund the necessary investments to do so.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "We also continue to see strong engagement in digital payment offerings such as Citi Pay, a point-of-sale lending product which is easily integrated into merchants’ checkout processes. And we are driving more value from our Retail Branches as well as getting the expense base right to increase returns there.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "We have a great franchise around the world, with great clients who are served by great colleagues. I am pleased with where we are, and I’m excited about where we are going. With the organizational simplification behind us, and a good quarter under our belt, we have started this critical year on the right foot. While there will be bumps in the road, no doubt, we will continue to execute with discipline and we are committed to reaching our medium-term targets.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Thanks, Jane and good morning, everyone. I am going to start with the firmwide financial results, focusing on year-over-year comparisons for the first quarter unless I indicate otherwise, and then spend a little more time on the businesses.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "RoTCE was 4.6% for the quarter. Looking ahead, we’re going to improve the returns of our Wealth business by executing on our three foundational priorities. As Jane mentioned, this will take time but over the medium to longer-term, we view this as a greater- than-20% return business.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Hi. Well, you just finished your seventh month of your org simplification and you said 7,000 positions go away, with $1.5 billion of expense savings. So that's very concrete, but more generally, after 20, 30, 40 years of matrix structure down to five lines of business, you're reporting these differently, you're talking about them differently, but the question that I think a lot of people have is, are you simply reporting these lines of business differently, or are you actually running them differently? Thanks.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Thank you, Mike, for the question. The simplification that we've just gone through, it is what we said it is. It is the most consequential set of changes, not only to the organization model that we have but how we run the bank. It's aligned the structure with the strategy. It's simplified the bank. It's eliminated needless complexity. It's created greater transparency into the five businesses and their performance as you can see. It's increased accountability. And very simply, it's just easier for our people to focus on our clients, but also getting things done and the execution that we have ahead of us.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "So maybe if I try and bring this a bit more alive, the first thing we did was we elevated the five businesses and that eliminated the ICG and PBWM layer, and we brought all the elements that the businesses needed to run end-to-end under the direct management of those five business heads, an example being operations. It's enabled transparency, greater accountability, and this end-to-end and total P&L focus, so focus on the bottom line and the returns driving growth, expense discipline, etcetera.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "We also right-placed businesses to align with the strategy, so Banking all being under one umbrella, the Investment Bank, the Corporate Bank, Commercial Bank, really helping us drive synergies there. Putting F&S and Securitization into Markets, so that we have a unified spread product there, also beginning to see the benefits of that this quarter.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "So, by eliminating the regional layer and putting in a far slimmer, lighter management structure in place in the geographies, that's enabled us to make sure that our countries are focused on client delivery and legal entity management, and we've eliminated the whole shadow geographic P&L. We've eliminated a large number of committees in the geographies, and this is where a lot of the functional and management roles were streamlined and eliminated through the last seven months. And we also broke the regions into smaller, lighter clusters, and that allows us to much better capture the big changes in trade flows and financial flows, etcetera we're seeing around the world. It's just much nimbler.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "The third piece, we created the client organization. So that organization makes sure that our core capabilities and disciplines are being applied firm-wide to drive revenue synergies. And then the governance has got a lot easier, it took up a lot of time, and we've given much clearer mandates and we've more than halved the number of committees. That's 200 committees-plus that we've eliminated in the firm, either by consolidating them or eliminating them.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "The spans and layers, if you exclude me, 98% of the firm now operates within eight layers. That is a much, much faster decision-making, it's much quicker to get execution done. It also means that you can very quickly get close to where the engine room of the firm is. We've got clearer accountabilities. We've eliminated most co-heads. We've reduced matrix reporting. We've got the producer to non-producer ratio improved. So all of this really means, as I've said, a clearer deck, so we can be laser-focused on business performance in those five businesses and the Transformation.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "It already feels different. Around my table, I'm much closer to the businesses and the clients. It makes it much easier for Mark and I and the rest of the team to run the bank like an operator versus the head of a holding company. You don't have to go through these aggregated layers to get things done.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "And we're done, as we said we would be at this point, we're wrapping up the final consultation periods. Not an easy few months for the organization. We've had to say goodbye to some very good people. We've put a lot of change through the organization. And now, as we close the chapter on this, we look forward to being back in BAU mode again, continuing to drive improvements and simplification and processes and the like, but now the focus is going to be really getting the full benefit from all the changes we've made in business and organization and moving forward.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "North America is our key priority. It's the biggest contributor to the global IB wallet. Tech, healthcare and industrials are likely to constitute over 50% of the fee wallet going forward. So we have better aligned our resources to position the franchise for this. Defending areas of traditional strength in industrials and the like, energy, whilst investing in high-growth sectors such as healthcare and technology with some strong talent.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "And indeed, the new org structure that I was just talking about really enables us to drive a more joined-up, client-centric, strategic coverage across Corporate, Commercial and Investment Banking. So over and above the wallet recovery, Mark and I are going to be very laser-focused on ensuring that we're driving revenue growth from a more holistic focus on the wallet share across flow and episodic activity.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Yeah. Look, the top line growth, as you've heard us say, is a CAGR of 4% to 5%. We've put that target out there of $51 billion to $53 billion as a range of what we're working towards. We've given you a good sense of how we expect to get there with the $2 billion to $2.5 billion reduction by then. We've already signaled $1.5 billion that's in front of us.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "With that said, we've got to continue to invest in the Transformation. We're not going to compromise that. That's going to be something that we have to spend on to ensure we continue to get right. But that's kind of how the dynamic works. There's a top – we've got a mix of businesses that I think we've demonstrated resiliency around if you think about the past couple of years, and we expect for those to continue to drive some top line momentum. But we've got levers in case they don't.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Yeah. Thank you, Erika. On the first part of the question, I'd just remind you and everyone else that we're playing for the long-term here, right. So, we have set some medium-term targets. Obviously, Jane has recasted the vision and the strategy. I think we're making very good progress against that, but we're playing for the long-term. And what that means is that we have to continue to invest in the franchise.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "It's why I've given you a range around the expenses, at least in part. It's why I've continued to stress the importance of protecting the Transformation and risk and control spend. And it's why I started the answer to Ebrahim's question by saying that we want to be sure that we can match the client demand out there, where the returns to do so makes sense. And so, we are having to balance kind of the use of capital and other resources against that longer term strategic objective and utilize it where it makes sense and generates good returns against the idea of returning that to shareholders.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "And so, we'll continue to do that. It's an everyday assessment. It's an everyday discussion with the teams. Frankly, it's why things like the revenue sharing has been put in place to intensify the discussion around the clients that we're using balance sheet with and ensuring that we're driving broader revenues across the platform. And so, that's kind of how we're operating in terms of making that trade-off on a regular basis, in addition to obviously the broader regulatory environment that we're in.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "And now coming out of that, we're seeing the COVID vintages mature, albeit at a lagged pace from what would be normal, and we're seeing the incremental acquisitions that we've done start to mature at their normal pace. And so, these loss rates are exacerbated by that impact and that's an important factor we can't lose sight of. But the bottom line is that we're watching it. The macro factors matter. We feel good about the quality mix that we have, and we'll kind of see how things evolve from here.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "I think importantly, as we think about our Corporate Lending activity, you'll note that actually we've been very disciplined about how we want to deploy balance sheet. And part of that again is a by-product of the revenue sharing that we've implemented, where there's been healthy debate and discussion around the names that we want to continue to serve, and whether they're positioned to take advantage of the broader platform that we have.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "And so, I think the space will continue to evolve. I think there's been good, healthy demand, despite continued strong balance sheets and part of that demand has been because of where rates are likely to go and continue to evolve. And I think we're well-positioned to be thoughtful about that, but Jane, you may want to add a couple points to it.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "The other piece I’d just pop out there as well is the recent large M&A announcements in multiple industries is a sign of rising confidence from CEOs and boards and active discussions are increasing, as supportive capital markets create confidence, as people think about larger strategic transactions. This is going to feed acquisition finance, bridge financing and some of the higher-margin capital markets and lending activity as well.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "So, as we look forward, I think it's recognizing the shift in some of the drivers from company just investing, refinancing, looking at where they can diversify their capital raising in different quarters. But I'd just close by saying I couldn't agree with you more about geopolitical risks and fragility. I think the market's too benign in its risk pricing on some of these factors.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Yeah, look. I think, Matt, as we've talked about many times, the Transformation is our top priority, it will be for the next few years. It is foundational for our future success, both in terms of delivering the strategy and the medium-term financial path and we've been making significant investments behind it, as well as not only on the consent order, but also making sure we've got this modern efficient infrastructure.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "And we're currently deep into a very large body of work, upgrading our data architecture, automating manual controls and processes, consolidating fragmented tech platforms, and all of these help enhance our business performance more broadly, not just the risk and control in the medium term.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "And as I've said though, there are a few areas where we are intensifying our efforts, such as the automation of certain regulatory processes and data remediation, particularly related to regulatory reporting. We're committed to getting these right. The org changes will help us with execution and making sure that we have the impetus and everything that we need behind it, the investments that we need. We keep a close eye on execution, making sure we've got the right level of resourcing and expertise and we'll invest what we need to do to make sure that we address these different concerns.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "I can't go into much more detail in terms of CSI obviously, but something of this magnitude you'd expect us to have some areas where we have good progress and others where we need to intensify efforts.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "It's also a lot of the investments that we've been making, fuel a lot of the growth we've got. We have a market- leading product innovations and those continue to drive good returns, good growth. If it's Citi Token Services, Citi Payment Express, 24/7 Clearing, all of these different elements really mean that this business is utterly invaluable and indispensable to our clients and the stickiness of the deposits, the operating deposits comes with that, so we feel good about that growth. And you'll hear more about this as well, Mike, in the Investor Day in mid-June which will be I think we hope will be very helpful to everyone so you really get your arms around how this business operates, makes money, and see why we call it a crown jewel.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Thank you, Jenn, and a very good morning to everyone. First, I am going to discuss our first quarter results and then talk about the environment we are operating in and how we are positioning the bank for it.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Overall, it was a strong quarter, marked by continued momentum in each of our five businesses.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Turning to our strategic priorities, our transformation investments continue to modernize our infrastructure, simplify our processes, and reduce manual touchpoints. During the quarter, we retired legacy applications and automated reconciliations to name but a few accomplishments.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "From quarter to quarter, we are building on our track record of progress, and I am confident in our ability to continue delivering despite the uncertainty of the moment.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "While our corporate and consumer clients are resilient and in good financial health, the world is in a wait-and-see mode and is facing a more negative macro-outlook than anyone had anticipated at the beginning of the year.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "We appreciate the Administration taking a fresh look at regulations across all industries to unlock growth. We welcome the changes being discussed in our own industry to place more focus on material financial risks and to make it easier for banks to contribute to economic growth and to improve client service.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "The deep knowledge and breadth of capabilities that we have from decades on the ground in so many local markets are real points of distinction when serving our clients, from reconfiguring their supply chains, to addressing their hedging and funding approaches, to advising on their strategic agendas.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "I am very confident that we have built a strategy based on a diversified business mix that will perform in a wide variety of macro scenarios and is differentiating in times like these.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "As I look forward to the rest of the year, we shall remain disciplined about returning capital and managing our expenses whilst protecting necessary investments in our businesses as well as our transformation. And we shall not allow the uncertainty to distract us from executing our strategy and improving our returns.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Thanks, Jane and good morning, everyone. I am going to start with the firmwide financial results, focusing on year-over-year comparisons unless I indicate otherwise, and then review the performance of our businesses in greater detail.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "As we’ve said in the past, we are very focused on bringing down our expense base.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "At the same time, the transformation remains our #1 priority, and we will continue to make the investments needed, specifically as it relates to data and regulatory reporting.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Glenn, I would be delighted to do so. So, our diversified business mix is very well positioned for a variety of scenarios. We think we've got a very broad suite of products and services. And they are the ones that clients need if they're going to be repositioning for a new order in trade or broader impacts here. And think about what you've seen over the last few years where we played a very central role: the Ukraine- Russia war, China, the COVID-related supply chains. We saw a lot of growth from deepening with clients and acquiring new ones because they need us, because we have exactly the expertise and the products and services that multinational institutions need, and we have them in the places that they need it. Now, the mix of those different revenues, different products and services we have could be different depending on which scenario prevails. And what I have to say at the moment, the level of engagement that we have with our clients all around the world, is just off the charts, given the unique depth of our presence and the insights we have in all the markets.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "What I'd say about the clients at the moment, you're seeing deals still happening. We've done a number of them, as we've talked about, even over this last weekend, we were pretty busy, but I would say that most clients are pausing their plans.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Now no one is taking bets in the market right now. We're seeing them prep for more headwinds. So, we're seeing some bolstering of already strong balance sheets.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Remember, our client base aren't the smaller companies in the mid-market that are going to get more pummeled in this type of environment. So that our clients are getting ready. We're seeing some accelerating of imports to stockpile inventories. We are seeing a pausing on significant CapEx, while everyone waits to get clarity on the full agenda. And in that full agenda, remember, there's tax bill, there's deregulation actions. These are some positives that will be coming. It's a very big agenda. Clients appreciate it's going to take time.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "In terms of the trading side, what we're seeing is it is pretty orderly out there. There's a lot of complicated dynamics happening, but it's not being catalyzed by liquidity crisis or other things going on. Let's not fight the war, the last war. The issue we're tackling at the moment is something different. And we're seeing clients taking the opportunity to de-risk. We are, others are, so that if we have more turbulence ahead, everyone is in a stronger position for it, and that is a good thing.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "So, you've seen us perform extremely well over the last few years in the face of pretty wrenching changes in the global economy. You’ve seen it with say, shifts in supply chains after COVID and then between the geopolitical tensions that are going on, you saw it in pretty significant changes that were happening from the Russia and Ukraine war. And you see us exactly as that, we are where the clients come, it's hedging for foreign exchange, interest rates, commodities, you see it for how they're looking at changing their financing around, and we tend to be the ones that are helping them reconfigure the flows. So, from that point of view, we are the active agent in a lot this mix. And we are a port in the storm as I said, Mike, we've got very strong balance sheet, capital and liquidity to deploy. We have the big strategic changes and organization changes behind us, and they're enabling us to be on the front foot. And this is a firm that is much more agile and able to respond and be much more focused on clients right now. So, I feel good about this.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Okay. The flip side of this is you did say the drivers are same. They might be different in magnitude to take you from where you are now you had over 9% RoTCE in the quarter. You said you're on track to get to 10% to 11% next year. Can you put a little meat on the bones kind of verbal waterfall chart, if you would, or maybe some numbers around org simplification stranded costs, productivity savings. How do we get from 9% in the first quarter to that magical double-digit return target for next year?\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "And this is Jane's point around how that mix may evolve, but the 3% plus that we're expecting this year, and again, in 2026, is an important contribution to that.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "So, we sit here today and as Jane mentioned, we're seeing nothing that would suggest that we shouldn't be targeting the 10% to 11% [RoTCE]. So, we remain committed to that 10% to 11% [RoTCE]. There's a path with the combination of those levers that I've mentioned. And importantly, this quarter is yet another proof point that our strategy is resilient, that we've got the right team on the ground to execute against it and that it's showing up in our numbers it's showing up in our returns.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "And April is performing in line with that as well.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "And they're also focused on getting the work done to be able to go public, things like the prepared audited financial statements or filling the various regulatory requirements.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "We've also, I think one of the pieces Gonzalo and the team have done a good job with is, they've been proactive and tightening risk and acquisitions and existing programs in the last couple of years. And I think that also puts us into another reason where we feel in a good position as we head into whatever lies ahead.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Okay. Excellent. And then, Jane, just separately, on Slide 2, you identify the main priorities for 2025 and 2026, many of which we've talked about here this call. I just wanted to understand from your perspective on the transformation, how far along do you feel you are in the modernizing your infrastructure? And what kind of time frame do we have to go from here to check the box on that one, if you ever can check the box. And then separately on the Commercial Banking segment, if you could just give us some insights there, too.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Okay. There's a lot in there. So, as you remember, the transformation is a very large body of work. We're overhauling our infrastructure. We're reducing and modernizing our applications. We're simplifying our processes. And so, we're addressing the different root causes of what held us back, thoroughly and once and for all. And I feel good about the progress we've made. We're seeing more and more of the benefit into how we run bank.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "As you know, we fell behind in data, particularly regarding regulatory reporting. We've taken action to get that into shape, and we're confident in how that's now progressing. In many parts, the risk management compliance programs, we're already operating at or close to the target state.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "So, our focus is now ensuring we're delivering the risk reductions and the outcomes in a sustainable way. And I'm excited about the work we've been doing in making sure that our technology and our overall control environment is what we call modern and simple. We're simplifying and standardizing controls across common activities. We've put a lot more preventative and detective controls in place. We're upgrading others that weren't effective enough. We're driving automation. We're driving straight-through processing of our end-to-end processes across the bank. And you've heard us talk pretty consistently over the last couple of years about the work to make the technology infrastructure onto consolidating on to single platforms, retiring legacy applications.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "We've got quite a unique value proposition. I've been very pleased to see the growth we've been seeing in acquiring new companies, who will be the future major players as they grow in global economies. And this is happening in many of the big bright spots around the world. It's in India. It's in Australia. It's happening in Japan. It's happening through Europe as well as in North America. So, a lot of good future growth activities there, good returns.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "And when you're in the emerging markets, there is only one word for quality, and that's Citi.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Look, the strategy that Andy has laid out and talked about is working. We've got the franchise very focused around net new investment assets, bringing those in from the $5 trillion of assets that are off us with existing clients, as well as new wealth that that is being created and new clients we're bringing to the franchise. And so, I'm very pleased as well with the caliber of the team that he has brought to bear here. We've got real horsepower and firepower in our investment capabilities. And he is also investing to improve client experience, a new relationship with Palantir here as well. And it's a team that's on the front foot. And in this environment, around the world, clients are really looking to us for advice because there are not many global wealth managers. They're looking to us for a global perspective, the capabilities we've got on the ground all around the globe and helping put them into good position amidst the uncertainty. So, we are a destination of choice right now, and we're taking full advantage of it. I don't see that changing. This is the strength of Citi. The strategy is working.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Thank you, Jenn, and good morning to everyone. While this quarter wasn’t as eventful as the first quarter, it was not without its moments.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "China is the biggest disappointment, as growth decelerated after an initial post-reopening pop. I was there last month, and let’s just say few on the ground expect China to be as strong a driver of global growth this year as some had hoped.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "So bottom line, globally we continue to see the same quite challenging macro-economic conditions that we saw in the first quarter. From Citi’s perspective, we continue to see the benefits of our diversified business model and strong balance sheet. We remain laser focused on executing our strategy and simplifying and modernizing our bank. Despite the turbulence and macro backdrop of the first half, we are on track with the plan we laid out at Investor Day and remained committed to our strategy and medium-term ROTCE target.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Separate to repositioning, we remain committed to bending our expense curve by the end of 2024 through three significant efforts.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "First, we continue to make investments in our Transformation and other risk and control initiatives which are necessary to modernize our infrastructure, automate our controls, as well as improve the client experience. As we said before, we will start to see the more material benefits of these investments over the medium-term.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "All this means that by year end, considering how far the divestures and winddowns have progressed, Legacy Franchises will have materially reduced its exposures and primarily be down to Mexico, Poland, Korea and the elimination of the remaining stranded costs. As such, as we move through the second half of the year, we will be in a position to focus on the third leg of bringing down our expense base through a leaner organizational model.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Overall, we are pleased with the progress we have made but there remains a lot to do. We will continue to update you on the progress we are making every quarter.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Thanks, Jane and good morning everyone. I am going to start with the Firmwide financial results, focusing on year-over-year comparisons for the second quarter unless I indicate otherwise, and spend a little more time on expenses and capital. Then I will turn to the results of each segment.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "We are investing in the execution of our Transformation and continue to see a shift in our investments from third-party consulting to technology and full-time employees. And as we said last quarter, our Transformation and technology investments span across the following themes: Platform and process simplification, security and infrastructure modernization, client experience enhancements and data improvements.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "And we will continue to reassess how and where we deploy capital and evaluate the appropriate level of our management buffer over time.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "While there’s clearly more work to do in wealth, we are seeing good momentum in underlying drivers.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "And then the final one is around simplifying our organization. And you heard in Jane's prepared remarks, as we continue to make progress on these exits, it opens up the opportunity for us to lean more heavily into that simplification. So, we are focused on not only the guidance, but the bending of the curve as you point out and looking forward to delivering that and taking actions to ensure we do.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "So just as a follow-up, is the way to think about sort of 2025 and beyond as you get through a lot the automation on the sort of the non-legacy businesses and start to get much more efficient there. Is there an absolute expense decline story in the core business? Or is that more that you need the top line growth to get the improved returns?\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Plus, it's a fairly uncertain macroeconomic environment at the moment, so both Mark and I feel it's prudent to continue making that assessment until some of this uncertainty is clarified as to what precisely we’ll do.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "It's from exits and I think you've got a clear sense around the progress that we have been making on the divestitures. And therefore, we're pivoting, as we talked about, to focus now on really tackling the stranded expenses as we close off the final couple of sales there in Asia in the next few months.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "We'll realize the benefits from our investments in transformation and controls over the medium term. We'll also have the benefit of the remediation work getting done and expenses going away from that. And then the third one will be simplifying the organization, as we talked about. So, we'll continue to walk you, step by step, what are the different actions we're taking, what are we doing, and hopefully we are building up that track record of doing what we will say we are going to do every quarter.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "So, I hope that helps, Erika. I appreciate the focus on both capital and expenses. We are equally focused on it and know just how important it is to achieving those targets. We're not only kind of doing the things that we've highlighted in that strategy articulation, but we're also being responsive to the current environment that we're in. We think that aids in our ability to deliver the targets and the bending of the curve, and we know there's an additional opportunity that Jane has referenced to the simplification of the organization as we make -- what I would argue is considerable progress on the exits towards the end of this year. And all of those things will be important to ensuring we get to that lower cost base, which we will do.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "And it's a laser micro focus from us to make sure that we have the plans in place and the execution to be able to achieve it. This is something we're extremely hands-on around and making sure that, it’s going to get done on each of the different drivers that Mark talked about.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "I'll kick it off, Mark, and then pass it to you. So we're confident we're going to meet 11% to 12% RoTCE target over the medium term. The core drivers of how we get there remains unchanged.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "And I think what's important here is that whenever it comes out, whatever it looks like, as we dissect it and go through it, we'll figure out how to manage through it, right, whether that be through exiting certain products, seeking price adjustments as it relates to customers, clients and the markets or continuing to optimize RWAs and we have been doing very proactively, we'll figure out how to manage.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Yes. Again, the thing I'd point out and Jane, feel free to chime in here, is that what we talked about was getting to our medium-term returns, 11% to 12% and the medium term is ‘ 25 to ‘ 26, right? So it's not just ‘ 25, just to be clear. And we do continue to feel very confident around our ability to do that. You heard us mention the levers that we think will contribute to that. Obviously, capital is important and how that evolves, and we continue to kind of work to optimize the balance sheet while serving our clients effectively and importantly, growing the strong businesses that we have that are high returning as well.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "I think that the transformation spend investments and those things, look we are squarely into execution, as you've heard us mention before. And as I've mentioned, the expense base around that is going to continue to morph from spend that we've made around third-party consultants and that helped in the crafting of the plan towards technology, towards people that are critically involved in the execution of it and then a downward trajectory towards the benefits we get from that technology and reduced operational expense. And so, it's a multi-year journey, we've talked about that. We've got a number of years to continue to execute against it. But what's important is we know what we have to do, both in how we're investing that money and as it relates to being disciplined about our cost structure and bending the curve. And again, that's what we're going to do.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "I know this is going long here. Just a quick one, just, Mark, just wanted to get your sense on the sentiment around client activity in both the Markets group and what the pipelines are looking like in Investment Banking and the feel for that? Thanks.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Look, I'll jump in here. Corporates are pretty cautious. They've got another Fed hike in the offing, tensions in China and the West, OPEC and all, and a general sense of more limited growth. But I think clients have been trying to understand and get their arms around both the macro and the market outlook for a while. I think they now seem to accept the current environment is new normal and are beginning to position themselves globally.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "And on the investor side, most of the investors stayed on the sidelines in Q2. The debt ceiling was a bigger topic than economic news was, and then it was a very low vol environment. We saw a bit of a pickup at the beginning with the light bump in volatility in the last few days, but I wouldn't call that a trend yet.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "I can't speak to the peers at this particular stage. But what I would say is that you know that our book skews more so than peers to corporates, and that's important. And we obviously have a very, very strong FICC business more broadly as well. So dividend season, major driver here in that increase.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Addressing these areas is the primary goal of our Transformation, our number one priority. It is a multi-year effort to modernize our infrastructure, unify disparate tech platforms and automate processes and controls.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "This week’s actions focused primarily on data quality management. We have been public this year about the fact that we were behind in this particular area and that we had increased our investment as a result.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "While these actions were not entirely unexpected to us, it is no doubt disappointing for our investors and our people. We completely understand that. At the same time, we are confident in our ability to get these specific areas where they need to be, as we have been able to do in other areas of the Transformation.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "And we are pleased that it was acknowledged on Wednesday that we have made meaningful progress in executing our Transformation, and simplifying our firm. A multi-year undertaking such as this was never going to be linear.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "The investments we have been making are starting to come together to reduce risk, improve controls and deliver tangible outcomes. The tech investments we have made are making a difference. We have reduced the time it takes to book loans; automated controls for our traders to reduce errors; moved risk analytics to a cloud-based infrastructure; and increased the resiliency of our platforms to reduce downtime.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "The changes to our organization and our culture are making a difference. We have eliminated managerial constructs and layers whilst empowering our leaders. We introduced new tools to better manage human capital needs. Our focus on culture has increased accountability and attracted great new talent such as Vis Raghavan, Tim Ryan and Andy Sieg.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "You have my and the entire management team’s commitment that we will address any area of the consent order where we are behind by putting the necessary resources and focus behind it. We will get this work where it needs to be, as we have with the execution of our strategy and the simplification of our organization.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "At our recent Services Investor Day, we very much enjoyed the opportunity to talk to you in-depth about how we are going to continue to grow this high-returning business. And we are very pleased that people are starting to recognize why we describe it as our crown jewel.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "We have seen some healthy volumes associated with announced deals year to date, particularly in Natural Resources and Technology. Combined with a strong pipeline, advisory activity looks promising as we think about the rest of the year and into next year.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "We have made an incredible amount of progress in simplification- both strategically and organizationally. We have completed most of the exits of our international consumer markets. We streamlined our organization to catalyze agility and faster decision making. We are modernizing our infrastructure to improve our client service and automating processes to strengthen controls.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Thanks, Jane and good morning, everyone. I am going to start with the firmwide financial results, focusing on year-over-year comparisons for the second quarter unless I indicate otherwise, and then spend a little more time on the businesses.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "As we said over the past few months, we will continue to invest in the Transformation and technology to modernize our operations and risk and control infrastructure. We expect these investments to offset some of our saves and headcount reduction going forward.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Before going into the balance sheet and the business results for the quarter, I’d like to also give more color on the Transformation and address what the Fed and OCC announced Wednesday. We have made good progress on our Transformation in certain areas over the last few years, and I want to highlight some of those areas before discussing the announcement.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "First, Wholesale Credit and Loan operations, where we implemented a consistent end to end operating model and consolidated multiple systems with enhanced technology. This has not only reduced risk but enhanced operating efficiency and the client experience.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "We have also made improvements in risk and compliance as we enhanced our risk assessments and technology capabilities to increase automation for monitoring.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "DCM continued to benefit from strong issuance activity, mainly in Investment Grade, as issuers continued to de-risk funding plans in advance of what could be a more volatile second half in the context of a number of important global elections as well as the macro environment.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "As we’ve said before, we will continue to take actions to manage through regulatory headwinds, lap the credit cycle and grow revenue while improving the overall operating efficiency of the business to ultimately get to a high-teens return over the medium term.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Thank you, Mark. So transforming, to answer your question about how do we fix it and serve our investors at the same time. Transforming Citi will drive benefits for our shareholders, our clients, and our regulators. This is not mutually exclusive.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "At the beginning of the year, we honed in on two priorities, the transformation and improving our business performance, and we're able to do so because we've largely cleared the decks. We have a clear focus strategy, we've executed the divestitures, we've got a much simpler organization, so we can focus on these two priorities and we are able to do both.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "You can see that in our results again this quarter, multiple, solid proof points on the execution of the strategy and we know what we need to do on both fronts. We have plans in place on the transformation and on the strategy and we're executing against them. We have been and we will be transparent when we have issues and how we're addressing them.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "At the same time, we're investing in the business and we're looking to see continued growth in volume and on the top line. And the combination of those things, as we drive towards the medium term, will help us to deliver both the top line growth and certainly improve returns from where we sit today and in line with what we've guided to.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Okay. Appreciate all that. One quickie on DCM. You had amazingly good performance. There's been plenty of conversation about pull forward this year on just refi driving like three-quarters of the activity. Could you just help us think through the second half when thinking about DCM just to make sure that we don't like start modelling this into perpetuity?\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Essentially if an area is delayed or looking as if it could be, we'll determine what additional resourcing, if any, is required to get back on track and then we'll share that with the OCC in a more formalized way than we do today and we obviously review this pretty constantly ourselves.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "And I just want to reiterate, we remain confident that we will meet our 11% to 12% RoTCE target over the medium term. And we've got the, we have the ability to manage the different elements we've been talking about today, making sure that we're investing sufficient resources into the transformation so we can be on track with that, as well as in our businesses, as well as the return of capital to our shareholders. So, we feel confident around that and good about it, we can manage this.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "We've been able to find productivity opportunities that allow for us to still stay within the guidance that we've given for the full year. So, we are managing this entire expense base, right, so not – the whole $53 billion plus of it, we are actively managing that with an eye towards what's required from a transformation point of view to keep it on track, to accelerate in areas where we're behind and to shore up areas where we're tracking in accordance to what the order requires and where are the other inefficiencies that can allow for us to free up the expense base? And so, things like the work that Andy Sieg has done with the finance team around that expense base and finding efficiencies there are opportunities that we've been able to tease out of the business. Things that we have done in parts of USPB and that we have continued to get after in parts of Banking, which you see in the down 10% this quarter are areas where we've been keenly focused on, where are there duplicative roles, where are there inefficient processes that we can actually drive greater efficiency out of. So, longwinded way of saying, we understand the expense guidance that we've given, we also understand and stress the importance of funding the transformation with what's required and we're doing both.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "No, you're not right. So, I think as you've heard us talk about, Vivek, for a while now, that we knew the areas that we were behind in elements of our transformation program and that we began addressing those and making the investments. Some of that's in people. Some of that is in technology spend. It's using different tools and capabilities to get areas addressed earlier and we began that earlier in the year and you saw that acknowledged as well by our regulators who pointed to the fact that we've already begun addressing the areas that we're behind.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "That's right, Jane, and what you have heard is that despite having to spend more, some $250 million or so more, we're not changing the guidance, right. And so, we have, as Jane mentioned, we have worked on areas already that we've needed to and we have looked for ways to absorb that and are doing so within our guidance.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Look, the plan, the Resource Review Plan, as Jane mentioned, is what we're working through now with the regulators. That will be a process for demonstrating to them that we are spending and allocating the appropriate resources to accomplishing the commitments that we have. Appropriate resources can range from people to technology to enhancing our processes and ensuring better execution.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "If you think about what that will entail, it will entail areas where we are delayed or behind as we identify those areas, being able to tease out the root cause of any delay and ensure that we've got proper funding allocated to get it back on track and that's me framing out how I think about what something like this might look like. And so, what we're saying is that if we identify issues in the quarters to come, that we haven't identified already, that's the process we're going to apply to those issues. And as you've heard us say repeatedly, we're going to spend whatever is necessary to then get those things back on track. And as we've done thus far this year, we're going to look for opportunities to absorb those headwinds. I hope that's clear.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Yeah, I think, Jane, that's right. And I think let's not lose sight of the purpose of the orders that are there and the purpose of the orders that are there are to ensure that we're funding and allocating the effort appropriately, right.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Until the Resource Plan is agreed and as you'll have seen, the Resource Plan needs to be submitted within 30 days, and as I indicated, we're working on that one and not anticipating that to be a problem.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "And we have many of our business heads very much focused around that opportunity as well. So, winning in the US is a very important leg, for example, of the strategy that Vis is refreshing. Similarly, we see opportunities from the Commercial Bank. We see it in Wealth. We see it in, obviously in US Personal Banking and in Services. So, we're very, we're focused from a business strategy point of view on this, not just from the financial side.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Thank you, both, for that color. Maybe just a quick follow-up just on the Retail Services business. We are seeing some evidence that your competitors in this space have been more aggressive leading with price in an effort to win some new mandates. And was hoping you could just speak to what you're seeing across the competitor set and your appetite or willingness to potentially offer better economics in response to increased competition from some of your peers.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "We have a target state for the different areas of it. We have the plan to achieve those target states. We'll make the investments necessary to ensure that we do so. We'll try and get this done as quickly, but as robustly as possible and we're doing this by making strategic fixes and investments rather than, what I would call, the old Citi way, which is a series of Band-Aids that remediate, but don't actually fix the underlying issue and that way, we are delivering for our shareholders as well as our regulators and our clients because we're putting in strategic solutions that will benefit all, but I'm not expecting this to change the timeframes.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "So, but what is the transformation doing? What it is doing is simplifying how data moves through the firm and it's about upgrading the management and governance over those flows. And as I've said, we're doing a strategic overhaul of large parts of our infrastructure, so what are we doing?\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Mark's been investing in building a standardized reporting infrastructure. You've heard us talk about a single full suite reporting ledger versus the six or so reporting ledgers that we had in the past. And we're delivering all of this through consolidated systems, through the automation and streamlining of data flows, so instead of being in multiple pipes, the flows go through single pipes. So, it's a, sorry to get a bit plumber on you for a moment, but I think it is important to understand what it is because it's a lot of work. It's a strategic overhaul. It's not a series of tactical fixes.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Where we're behind, as we do the work on data, we identify specific issues we need to fix as we execute the plan that we have in place. There's some more areas to address than we knew back when we did the plan and we've also accelerated the work on improving the accuracy of our regulatory reports and we increased the scope of this work as well. It's more comprehensive than originally planned.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "So, what we're doing, we're adding resources and data experts. We're learning from best practices and we're using some great AI and other data tools that are helping to identify anomalies in data and data flows much more quickly. We're also, to some of the culture side, we're learning from pilots how do we accelerate broader deployment at scale across the firm in a consistent enterprise-wide manner. So, all of these things in the data side are going to enable us to leapfrog competitors, more revenue opportunities, better client service, fewer buffers, drive more efficiencies and hope at the end – the end goal here is it becomes a competitive advantage for the firm. That is the data plan.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "I always said that a transformation of this magnitude over multiple years would not be linear. We have many steps forward. We have setbacks. We adjust, we learn from them, we move forward and we get back on track.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "September is always a busy month seeing clients, and I am struck how consistently CEOs are less optimistic about 2024 than a few months ago. The shift in the rates question from how high to how long has catalyzed more client activity, however. Corporates have stopped waiting for rates to come down and are beginning to access the debt capital markets around the globe.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "As you know, we are committed to growing our Banking franchise. We have brought together the management of the Investment, Corporate, and Commercial Bank under one umbrella and this structure will help us better drive the important synergies between them. We have been bringing in new talent in key sectors and we have begun to provide more leveraged finance for key clients in the right situations.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Transformation remains our number one priority. We are deep into the large body of work of automating manual controls and processes, consolidating fragmented tech platforms, and upgrading our data architecture. We are committed to doing this the right way, knowing that it will take time to meet our regulators expectations and to deliver a modern, more efficient infrastructure.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Last month we announced consequential changes that align our organizational structure with our strategy and changes how we run the bank. I said at Investor Day that organizational simplification would follow the divestitures. The changes will eliminate layers, duplication, and complexity allowing us to operate the bank more agilely and freeing our people up to focus on clients and execution.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Elevating the five core businesses to my leadership team will enable me to drive greater accountability and sustainable results. To bring it alive, the actions we have taken in the last four weeks will eliminate over 15% of the regional and functional roles at the top two layers, and 60 committees, freeing up over tens of thousands of people hours annually. We have identified about 1,000, or 50%, of our internal financial management reports that we won’t need any longer and have taken out co-heads and dual reporting lines to enable faster decision-making.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "We are cascading these changes through the organization at pace. We announced the first two layers in September and the next set of changes will be implemented by mid-November, and we aim to bring the entire process to a close by early next year.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "And at the end of the work, we will have a simpler firm, that can operate faster, better serve our clients and unlock value for our shareholders.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "We have made tough decisions here. I want to note how pleased I have been with how the leaders of the firm, especially the next generation, have embraced these changes and are stepping up to implement them. They fully understand that we need to change how we run Citi in order to truly transform it once and for all.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Thanks, Jane and good morning, everyone. I am going to start with the Firmwide financial results, focusing on year-over-year comparisons for the third quarter unless I indicate otherwise, and then spend a little more time on the businesses.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "So overall, while the market environment remains challenging and there is more work to be done, we are making solid progress against our strategy in these businesses.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Before we move to Q&A, I’d like to end with a few points. We are executing on our strategy and delivering top line revenue growth of 5%, year-to-date. We continue to invest for the long term with discipline while remaining on track to deliver on our expense guidance.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "We are focused on simplifying our organizational and management structure, which will further support our speed of execution. We are managing our capital in a disciplined way in light of regulatory headwinds, while continuing to optimize and return capital to shareholders. And we remain confident in our ability to achieve our RoTCE target of 11-12% in the medium term.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Hi. Jane, you spoke more about the restructuring that you commented on recently. The real question is, why is this restructuring different than the other 5 or 10 or 15 restructurings we've heard about since Citi's creation in its current form 25 years ago, I think, just like a week ago? So, I'd say, why is this different? We hear the talk about cascading downward and the simplification, reducing dual heads and the committees. But we've heard this so much that why is this time different?\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Yeah. It's a very important question, Mike, thank you for asking it. As I've said, we view these as the most consequential changes we've made, not just to our organization model, but how we run the bank, in almost two decades. And the first piece is simple, which is our org model was set up for a financial supermarket, that is simply not the bank we are today. So we are aligning the organizational model with that simper business mix and strategy.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "But what's truly different is we're changing how we run the bank. And these are permanent changes that will be driven all the way down through the organization. So let me give you some examples to bring it to life. We talked about delayering the first two or three layers of the bank. That will continue through the organization, through the spans and layers, particularly getting rid of aggregator roles. And let me give an example: HR, we had HR in a region, you had the region head, you had the Institutional Client Group head, you had the Banking head, in addition, you had a North Asia head and a South Asia head. We're just going to have the North Asia head and the South Asia head. And all of those roles collapsed into those two.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "We're eliminating activities in the geographies that we just don't need anymore, because we are no longer running local consumer franchises in them. So, let's take the financial reporting, sorry, the management reporting that Mark and I referred to in the opening remarks. We can reduce our management reports by about 50%. That's 1,000 reports. What does that mean? Shadow P&Ls by country, quarterly outlooks, monthly performance updates, all the associated tracking and reconciliations that are there that are effectively for a shadow P&L, rather than the one that matters to our shareholders. And so, that greatly declutters.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "It also means we can eliminate processes for our Transformation, where we are looking at how do we automate those processes, automate those controls. If they're a duplicative process, we're getting rid of them so we don't need to do that anymore and it will accelerate the work on Transformation.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "We are taking activities out of some of the businesses and centralizing them. A lot of the client activities that will go embedded into a business, we move that up to centralized utilities that the whole firm can benefit from and that will get scale economies. These strategy teams, marketing teams, many of the little cottage industries that build up over time.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "We can speed up decision-making with fewer committee layers. We'll take down the number of layers and drive that from some places 13, we're looking to getting to 8 in as many places as we possibly can. We're giving clarity of decision rights and changing decision rights from two or more people to just one.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Our strength is our global network. I don't want our geographies focused on the full monty of management processes that are a duplication of what's happening in the product organization. I want them focused on delivering to our clients, engaging with our clients and also managing their responsibilities of the legal entities.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "So, it's very different. You'll get more flavor of it in the fourth quarter earnings call, but I hope that gives you a sense of why this is really different. This is how we are running the place. It's not just an org restructuring. Both are necessary.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "So, I'm curious, you mentioned that you're still marching towards the 11%, 12%, which is good because everyone was going to ask that. My question is a little bit different of, with the denominator going up 25%, in other words, a lot of things are working towards your Transformation, but there's sort of a curve ball in there with upping the denominator by 25%. So, you seem to be a beneficiary of higher for longer for sure. And you also mentioned you're working on mitigation as we speak. So, maybe you could talk about what are the offsets that we don't see that give you confidence still working towards that, because the top line stuff is working?\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "The equity investments, and now that they go from 100% risk weighting to 400% risk weighting, I think we're going to take a hard look at whether those are worth keeping in light of the higher capital associated with them. That's going to challenge the returns, that's going to force us to look at those through a different strategic lens, and we're going to do that. And that's not to even mention the credit component that impacts both corporates and consumers as it relates to unfunded commitments, for example.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "And so, as we've done with SA-CCR and other types of reg changes, we're going to have to look at what it means for our product mix, the returns associated with those, whether there are opportunities to pull levers like pricing, or whether we have to take other decisions around those. And so, that's what I mean by the mitigating actions that we're dimensioning and putting on paper and working through, but again, want to be thoughtful because the rule is not final yet, and there are more discussions to be had around those important elements that I mentioned already.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "So, there’ s a couple of unstoppable trends that we’ re going to be riding in the next, I think it’ s decade-long. The corporate client of today, and indeed consumer, has to build resiliency. The multinational client is on a long-term trend of building resiliency, be it because of green, be it because of geopolitics, be it because of regulatory, whatever the different reasons may be, and there are multiple, they're having to build resiliency into supply chains, into their own operations as they operate around the world. We’re the bank that is absolutely there for them. And I think you've seen that in TTS, where we've had such strong drivers of growth in the last few years at the beginning of this trend. So, that is an important one. Wherever the clients want to go, we are there. We have been there for decades. We understand the risk. We understand the client base. We understand the opportunities there, at that. That micro level and local levels that someone who is flying in with a suitcase can't possibly deliver. And it's connected globally. So, this thing is just a thing of beauty.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "And finally the other one I do love, which is our Commercial Bank. We serve these entrepreneurs all over the world, who are going to be the drivers of many industries going forward. And we're serving them, helping them go international for the first step, tap them into global supply chains and the like. It's almost by definition the fastest growing of the mid-market companies are the ones that tap into what we can offer them. We build great relationships with them. And then our private bankers call on them, and then our investment bankers call on them. We have our capital market teams calling on them. And we help them grow and succeed. And that is going to be a big engine in the medium-term of new client acquisition feeding us.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "So, deeper client relationships, more growth in terms of new clients that fit with our proposition fairly uniquely, and some great mega trends that we are going to be riding and pretty uniquely positioned on. And we'll keep investing to make sure that where areas we're behind we get into the forefront of and the areas we are crushing it in, like our win rate is 82% in TTS, and we're going to make sure that we continue to do so and innovate that way. So, sorry to be so excited about this, the 4% to 5% just feels very, very doable to Mark and I.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Hey good morning. On the capital markets side, I heard the comments around it being hard to predict when deal activity will sustainably rebound. Can you just give us an update or more color on how CEOs are thinking about bringing deals live across M&A, ECM and DCM? And does the market and rate volatility over the last few weeks have any significant impact on bringing deals to completion or on the pipeline?\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "We still think that how our recovery and return to normal wallet plays out, when you talk to CEOs, is largely dependent on the macro environment. That's the main piece for them. ECM, we're seeing increased interest and activity on ECM. You obviously had several IPOs coming to market in September, three big ones that we were involved in. But the market is still somewhat fragile. We're watching it closely. And quite a few questions in Q4, things may move to Q1. We just have to see how that unfolds. But there's a good pipeline. I mean, there's a lot of pent-up demand here.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "In debt, we had a big pick-up in DCM. We feel confident that the gradual recovery in DCM and the beginnings of that lev fin one will continue. You're certainly going the see us more active in the lev fin space in the right situations for our key clients.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "So, it's there, but I think just given where everything is geopolitically and particularly from the macro, no one is going to make that call as to when we're going to see that sustainable turn in banking at this point.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "And then I think the final point is that as we continue to execute against the Transformation work, and as we implement the org simplification that we've just announced, undoubtedly the technology investment, the automation that we're putting in place, the straight-through processing that occurs, the fewer reconciliations that are required, the streamlining from all of those layers that Jane mentioned we'll be eliminating, all of those things will also work to reduce headcount as well.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "And so, while we're investing and hiring on the front-end to capture the upside as markets turn, but also as we position ourselves to grow with clients, we're also going to realize efficiencies that come out of headcount reduction.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "And then I think as we get to the medium term, you will start to see some of the benefits from the Transformation spend and investments that we would have made start to play out, as well as efficiencies that we start to get in a lower structural cost base. But again, that's in that medium-term period. So, all of those things will be drivers to getting the bending of the curve. I haven't broken down, I'm not going to break down here on this call how much comes from each of the pieces, but all are important factors to achieving that.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Good morning, Jane and good morning Mark. Jane, as you pointed out, you're very excited about the opportunities in TTS. You're winning some new mandates in the custody business. Can you feel is it because the competition is struggling with other issues? What gives you, because Citi has always been well-regarded in this area, so what gives you that added excitement that this is even getting better?\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "The momentum we have in 24/7 clearing that's been put in place, we've had over $1 billion processed year-to-date. Putting our Commercial Bank clients onto CitiDirect so they have seamless access to our whole TTS network globally. You heard us talking about Citi Token Services, you can see us innovating with the Fed in new capabilities.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "And it's opportunities as well with our Markets business linked in. One of our really differentiating factors that Andy Morton talks about all the time is his partnership with TTS. The fact that one of our major client bases are corporates and they have a different profile, let's say, to an asset manager or a hedge fund. And we uniquely can serve them. So, that's the piece. It's that combination in trends we see.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "I think that's spot on, Jane. The only thing I'd add is that the middle market commercial space is a huge opportunity for us, as you said earlier, leveraging that TTS platform. And then on the Securities Services side, the reality is that we're finally seeing real traction in North America, right? We've always had kind of strength in many of the other regions, but we're really winning some major mandates here in North America, which I think is enough to get really excited about.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Hi Jane. Hi Mark. Want to just clarify the reorganization a little bit. So, Jane, I heard you say that you're keeping North Asia and South Asia heads. So, did you just get rid of the Asia head and get rid of the product heads, where product heads in each country were reporting to a regional product head? So, is that that dotted line is no longer there or what's going on there? And when you get rid of all the monthly management reporting, what are you planning to replace that with from your management, your MIS perspective?\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "The first question was about, okay, help you understand what we've done. So, on the geography front, we have done two main things already. One is we've eliminated the regions and have just put a single international head reporting to me. So, that makes it much simpler for me. I have one international head, and then he will help us manage the geographies collectively.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "The second piece is we really narrowed the mandate of geography to delivering to our clients and covering our clients in their countries. And secondly, the legal entity management. And otherwise, before, we had a huge amount of management on shadow P&Ls and different, a lot of very heavy committee structure. That was necessary because the business was still very local, as a retail bank, a local credit card business, a local onshore wealth business. They've gone. It's just serving multinationals. The subsidiaries are multinationals and in some markets the investors and the wealth clients in some markets. And that's a much simpler business to manage. So, we could get rid of the regional layer, and we just jump straight down to the clusters that we have today. They too have less of a mandate than they had before, a much more focused one.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "And around the other piece that I think is also just an important point, globalization is changing and we're seeing these lanes all changing through trade, financial flows, et cetera. By actually having a single international organization and then the different clusters, North and South Asia, Europe, UK, LATAM, Middle East, Africa, the connection points between them are really changing at the moment. And so, this makes us much more agile in our delivery of the global network because I think it's much more in line with how the world is operating today.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Yeah, look, we remain confident around our ability to hit these targets. We've got, you heard me talk earlier around the revenue growth and what are some of the tailwinds that we've got behind us as well as the core strategy and the drivers that we're in control of and that we've been investing behind to achieve. So, our strategy is unchanged, we're confident it will drive the revenue growth of 4% to 5%. It's not the primary purpose, but the org simplification is the third driver of the expense reductions that we've talked about.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "And I would also say that when you look at revenue, expenses, and the targets we've laid out at Investor Day, we've certainly had plenty of headwinds in macro, regulatory, geopolitics in the last couple of years. We have delivered on what we said we would do in the revenue, in the expense guidance, and on the strategy. We've made adaptions along the way as we've needed to. But I think that's the piece that we're also really trying to drive into the firm is a culture of we will do what we say we will do, and we'll adapt accordingly to different areas.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "And while I usually start our calls with our views on the global macro environment, we are particularly proud of our progress this quarter, and so I shall start there.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Indeed, in a pivotal year, this quarter contains multiple proof points that we are moving in the right direction and that our strategy is delivering concrete results.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "And we continued to attract top leaders in the industry and successfully combine them with our own teams in Banking and Wealth.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Turning to the macro, now while growth is a notch slower than last year, global economic performance continues to be surprisingly resilient.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "India, Asean, Japan, the Middle East, Mexico and Brazil are all notable global bright spots.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "And the significant upside of our franchise continues to attract the top talent to Citi.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "I continue to be excited by the opportunities and the sheer potential of our franchise.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "As you know, our Transformation is our number one priority.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "We have increased our investments in areas where we have not made sufficient progress, such as data quality management.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "I and the management team remain steadfast and determined to get this Transformation right and to get this done.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "We will close out this pivotal year with momentum and with determination to continue to improve performance in each business and the firm overall.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "We are committed to meeting our revenue and expense targets for the year as well as our return target for the medium-term.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "It is a privilege to lead this firm.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "I am going to start with the firmwide financial results, focusing on year-over-year comparisons for the third quarter unless I indicate otherwise, and then spend a little more time on the businesses.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "As we’ve said before, we will continue to increase our investments to address data governance and data quality related to regulatory reporting and are committed to spending whatever is necessary to address these areas and the Transformation more broadly.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Although a lot more work remains, we have started to see benefits from our prior investments play through.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "As you can see from our performance this quarter, we are making good progress against our strategy and expect that momentum to continue.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "We will continue to drive revenue growth through product innovations while improving the operating efficiency of the business.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "As we take a step back, the third quarter represents another quarter of solid progress and a set of proof points towards improving firmwide and business performance.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "We remain focused on continuing to improve our performance and executing on our Transformation.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "These priorities remain critical to strengthening our operations and becoming a more efficient, agile and client-centric company as we continue to make progress on achieving our medium-term targets.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Okay. Thanks for all that, Mark. Just one quickie On your partnership with Apollo, very interesting and in line with a lot of other things we've seen. Curious on how you thought about going with one specific partner versus a group and then more importantly, are there other parts of the franchise that could benefit with stronger ties to private markets, I'm thinking specifically in the asset-backed world. Appreciate it. Thank you.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "So we're delighted to partner with Apollo because what this does is it's uniting our comprehensive banking reach and expertise together and it's enabling us to offer our clients more innovative and tailored financing solutions.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "And when we look at this, it's very, very beneficial for our clients. We're always looking at how we can best serve our clients, give them the most options and this platform enhances corporate and sponsor clients access to the private lending capital pool at real scale in $25 billion is a very sizable partnership here and it provides funding certainty and strategic transactions.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "So you've got this long-winded way of saying, I do expect flat into the fourth quarter. I'm not going to give guidance for 2025.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "The Wealth target we have in the medium term is 15% to 20% and with that a 25% to 30% operating margin and we're making steady progress there.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "I think the first piece was putting the pieces of the global wealth organization together and now we're focused on positioning for growth and reshaping the business to deliver the returns that we all expect.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "In other words, assurance that Citi can both walk and chew gum at the same time.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "And I guess I'd highlight as you know, on October 2 Senator Warren asked the OCC to impose growth restrictions because Citi is \"too big to manage.\"\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "So, look, we put out medium term targets of $51 billion to $53 billion in 2026, revenue dependent, of course, and that's consistent with the target we gave of less than 60% efficiency ratio.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Will there be headwinds? Yes. There will be, the transformation is a multiyear process.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "We're also investing in risk controls and regulatory spend to support improving our operations. Of course, there will be headwinds but there will also be things that we shift away from.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "As you know, and as Mark's talked to you about, the transformation reverses historic underinvestment in Citi's infrastructure. It enhances our risk and control environment. And it's a strategic overhaul as we've talked about that goes well beyond the consent order to simplify and to strengthen Citi to the benefit of all of the stakeholders we have.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "We are already a very different Citi today. We've made enormous change over the past three years, dramatically simpler business model, significant org change so we align our structure to that model.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "We now have a flatter organization with greater accountability and as Mark talked about through the investments in our transformation, we're focused on simplifying our operational model, modernizing our infrastructure risk and controls and all of that reduces risk as we go.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "We're well on the way in executing the transformation plans. We've made meaningful progress as was acknowledged publicly by one of our regulators and it's a wide range book of work.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Other areas of progress, enhance our stress testing capabilities, they're faster, more frequent, more precise assessments.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "And we've embedded risk and controls into our performance management framework and tied that to compensation for the full firm. So these are just giving you a flavor of these big body of work that we are executing and getting done.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Where there are areas in which our execution is delayed against our original timelines as is the case with our data work. We take a step back, determine what we need to change in those areas and get back on track and make relevant tech and people investments.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "So I would say quite the opposite. We are a source of tremendous strength for them and you see that in the results of this quarter which were very pleasing across the board in every single one of our businesses.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "If we fall behind in an element of the consent orders but do understand the breadth of the consent order work as I laid out and the meaningful progress we're making across multiple areas, and when we fall behind in an area we increase the investments needed and look at any lessons learned in the approach and address it.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Yeah. So, let's take it in pieces. So I think – the first thing is that, I think Jane and I have been very consistent with trying to give guidance on full year performance for the past couple years and we've largely actually delivered on that guidance.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "I also hope that you would then see that as we deliver on the expense target that we have a path to continuing to deliver on the medium-term expense target, the drivers of which I mentioned earlier.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "It's been a mantra for a long time in our Markets business, in Banking and a discipline that we've driven throughout the organization and I would say there isn't anyone at Citi that is not keenly aware of the focus around optimizing our capital.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "We are in the very final stages and are working with our clients to prepare them for this switchover later on in Q4.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "So I'm pleased with where we are and I hope that gives you a bit of a flavor of what the path ahead looks like.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "And I think it's about $4 billion or so of TCE that we have associated with this business. So that gives you some sense for the contribution, but it continues to perform quite well as we manage it through this process.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "And additionally, I think perhaps because capital markets is so strong across the board, across all of your peers, maybe that's not why you're getting, \"credit for your strength this quarter\".\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "And so that type of product creation is important to acquisitions, it's important to ensuring the card stays top of wallet and important to driving some of that top line performance.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "And this restructuring component was largely driven by the org simplification. That will be done this year.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "So the implications of what we're doing is as I've laid out, we've increased investments in the areas where we were behind, particularly in the data related to our regulatory processes and regulatory reporting.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "We're increasing investment behind it. And we continue to make progress, material progress on the orders in place including closing the BSA/AML order this quarter. The third order closed since 2021.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "It's much more a focus on what the market conditions at that point will be and Mark and I are very, very much focused on the shareholder value and maximizing that over – rushing over one quarter versus another quarter.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "And so those are important components of the NII story for Services.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Again, I don't want to get into 2025 at this stage. I assure you, we will give more color and commentary on that as we get into the fourth quarter earnings in January.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "But I'm just wondering – and you have consolidated systems apps, layers, bureaucracy and you're divesting lots of activities.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "And as you say, Mike, I listed a number of areas of progress and trying to make it as tangible as we can, given what we can and can't say as this is supervisory.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "I'm pleased that our businesses continue to improve their performance while the transformation is going on. They're the two priorities we have this year so I think effectively, yes, we can walk and chew gum at the same time and the huge benefit of all of the simplification on the business, on the organization, the other efforts, is making it easier for us to execute and be very focused.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "I think your question's helpful in the sense that you said is it kind of a rethink on our approach or is it the need to spend more money and one of the things that we've done, Mike, is take a step back and look at how we've been approaching data, for example.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "And so there are aspects of this that require a change in our approach and we've been taking that change, making that change rather, and we'll make more changes accordingly as we've taken that step back and there are aspects of it that require at a minimum review of what is causing either the delay or us not moving at the pace that we would like to move or that our regulators would like.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "And all of this drives productivity and other benefits for our shareholders as well as making sure that we're strengthening Citi from the regulatory perspective.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "It's clearly given where we are trading, we're very focused around the opportunities to buy back stock and mindful of the importance of it and equally, yes, we are proud of the performance of the franchise this quarter.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "It was a very strong quarter and important set of proof points for our investors. We are on a deliberate path.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "2023 was a foundational year in which we made substantial progress simplifying Citi and executing the strategy we laid out at Investor Day.  With that said the fourth quarter was clearly very disappointing.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Today I will provide a high-level view on our progress in 2023, discuss our Q4 results, and finish with our priorities for 2024.  We know 2024 is critical as we prepare to enter the next phase of our journey and we are completely focused on delivering our medium-term targets and our transformation.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "In September, we began the most consequential series of changes to the organization and the running of our firm since the aftermath of the financial crisis.  We restructured around five core, interconnected businesses to align our organization to our business strategy and to provide greater transparency into their performance.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Simplification is also enabling Citi to be more client focused and less bureaucratic.  Realizing the synergies between our five businesses is one of the key drivers to achieving our medium-term revenue targets. With this new structure, I am holding my business leaders accountable for enhancing connectivity across clients and products.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "In addition, having a Chief Client Officer acts to ensure we are disciplined in bringing the full power of our franchise to our clients.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "It was also a year where we upgraded talent with key internal promotions supplemented by selective external hires, including Andy Sieg.  The simplified reporting structure has been embraced by colleagues who feel empowered by the new structure to serve clients and drive value for shareholders.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "We certainly aspire to be better.  We are seeing improved confidence among CEOs and we like our pipeline, but of course the timing for a robust recovery is uncertain.  The share gains we have made in areas such as healthcare put us in a good position when this business turns more decisively.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "We remain committed to continuing to return capital to investors through both of these channels.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Moreover, we think environments like these play to our strengths. Given how far we are down the path of our simplification and divestures, 2024 will be a turning point as we will be able to completely focus on the performance of our five businesses and our Transformation.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Overall, we remain confident in our ability to adapt to the evolving capital and macro environments to reach our medium-term return targets and return capital to our shareholders, whilst continuing the investments needed in our transformation.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Thanks, Jane and good morning, everyone.  We have a lot to cover on today’s call – I am going to start with the fourth quarter and full-year firmwide financial results, focusing on year-over-year comparisons unless I indicate otherwise. I’ll also focus on our guidance for 2024 and end with the path to our medium-term return target.  The presentation of our results reflects the changes we have made in conjunction with our organizational simplification including reporting Legacy Franchises and Corporate/Other in All Other. However, before I go into the results, let me walk you through some of the notable items that impacted the quarter that were included in the 8K we recently filed.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Before I take you through each business, as Jane mentioned, we are not satisfied with the performance and returns of our businesses and therefore we are laser focused on executing against our strategy, simplifying the organization and right sizing the expense base. As a reminder the investments that we have been making have impacted each of the businesses as you will see in the next few slides.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "So clearly, we have more work to do on returns. And while it’s difficult to predict when activity will normalize, we’re positioning the business to capitalize on the rebound in the market wallet. And that includes continuing to invest in key growth areas, upgrading talent in traditional sectors, and continuing to right size the business.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "In TTS, we expect revenue growth to be driven by new client wins, deepening with our existing clients and continued momentum with Commercial Clients as we continue to leverage our global footprint and product innovations.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "The decrease in expenses will be driven by the benefits of our organizational simplification, a continued reduction from exit markets and wind-downs, and productivity savings, partially offset by investments in risk and controls and volume-related expenses.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Organizational simplification including the reduction of management layers. Eliminating stranded costs as we take additional actions to reduce excess overhead in light of the exit markets. And realizing productivity savings from our investments in the transformation and technology.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Well, thank you very much indeed, Mike. I'll start with, who is Citi? Citi is, I'm delighted to say, finally simple. At Investor Day, I set out a vision to be the preeminent banking partner for clients with cross border needs. That vision was based on five core interconnected businesses. We set off on a deliberate path to get there, and over the last three years we've done so.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Page 4 is who we are today. We are five interconnected businesses; no more, no less. We have our organization that now aligns with those five businesses, and this enables us to focus on two priorities. The first is improving the performance and the returns of those five core businesses, so that we can meet the medium-term RoTCE target we laid out. And the second is on addressing our regulatory issues through the transformation. And I would also be, I need to note that I fully recognize that 2024 is an inflection year, Mike. And I and the management team are accountable to deliver. And that you and our investors have the transparency you need to hold us accountable.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "So, why is this time different? Look, it's not lost on me that there's been many attempts in the past to change this firm. I and the management are fully committed to transforming this company for the long term and we are addressing the issues that have held us back in the past. And you've got proof points of the last three years where we've made a lot of tough decisions and we have put through a tremendous amount of change to get to the simple Citi that we are today. We completely reset our strategy. So, we now have a significantly more focused business and operating model.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "We've announced the most consequential set of changes to our organizational model, and frankly, from my perspective, more importantly, how we run the bank, since the financial crisis, aimed at simplifying the bank and increasing accountability. You've seen we’ve moved quickly. We're on track with our execution of this effort. And it will generate over $1 billion of run rate saves the end of the first quarter, purely from the organization efforts that we've put in that we announced in September.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "We've done this while investing and I think this is another difference. We've invested heavily in our transformation. And while that was catalyzed by our consent orders, these investments will ultimately deliver benefits from automation, from well-governed data, from consolidated platforms. We also have made significant investments in our business to support the 4% to 5% revenue growth and to ensure client momentum. And those investments have helped us expand our product suite, invest in digital capabilities, automate our processes, capture synergies through the client organization.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "We've also brought in some incredible external talent in key strategic areas, including Andy, to lead Wealth. And we now have a good balance between experienced Citi people and external talent with fresh perspectives through multiple layers of the organization.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "So, we are doing things the right way, we're doing it for the long term and we're moving with urgency. We will need and are spending the money that we need to, to address our regulatory requirements, but that's already embedded in our path to the 11% to 12% RoTCE in the medium term. And this already feels like a different bank. We have more work to do. I recognize 2024 is a critical year, and as I said, the decks are much clearer now, so that we can focus on two imperatives: improving our business performance and executing the transformation. Neither is an entirely linear path as we've seen over the last three years. We all know that. We get we have to build our credibility. We're committed to doing so. And we are providing far more transparency around the business performance, so investors have a better sense of how we're doing. And I and my management team, to your final question, are fully accountable for getting this all done. We will.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Yeah, thanks, Glenn. I guess, I'll start, and Jane, feel free to add in on it. Look, it is a balancing act, right, and we do look at each of our five core businesses. We obviously are clear on the strategy, but where's the growth? Where are the return opportunities associated with them? And how do we ensure we're deploying resources after them in order to deliver for the client and deliver on those returns over time? We have to juxtapose that against the required investment to modernize our operations and we're making those trade-offs on a regular basis. But importantly, when we do invest to capture those growth opportunities, we're trying to be agile about it, which means if those opportunities don't play out in the way we're expecting because the cycle just doesn't mature or materialize in that fashion, we've got to be disciplined enough to dial them back, and that's what you've seen over the past year plus, is that we've been investing in the business.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Where we didn't see the upside that we anticipated, we dialed back that spend, right, and that's the type of iterative process, if you will, Glenn, that we're putting in place to ensure that on the other side of this, we're still positioned to capture growth. Investment Banking, for example, we have invested in healthcare, in technology, building out to prepare ourselves for when that market rebounds. We feel good about that. We've done similar things in the way of our Wealth business. We're investing heavily in our TTS franchise to ensure we can remain competitive there, so it's that type of discipline that's required. It is sometimes a trade-off, but it's one that we've been very focused on being smart about.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Okay. And just as an expense follow-up, I wasn't clear. Has the transformation spend peaked, when you think about what you'll spend on transformation this year versus last year? And are the transformation benefits starting to kick in at this point?\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Yeah. So to be clear, we're going to continue to spend whatever we need to spend on the transformation and on risk and controls. And so, we did see a tick up this year. We've got a plan for 2024, and if we've got to spend a bit more than we spent this year, we're going to spend more. That's what the plan calls for, and so that's what we'll do. That's inside of the number that I've given you for guidance, all right. And so, that's important for us. I think it will drive, obviously, operational improvement and saves down the line.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "And the types of benefits we're seeing. This is the second year in a row that we've retired 6% of our legacy platform base. And you've heard me talking about moving 20 of our cash equity platforms on to 1, 6 reporting ledgers on to 1, 11 sanctioned platforms on to 1. So we start seeing some of the benefits of those come in.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "So there is a cumulative effect that is beginning to build now from all the work we've done, but it will take some time to really kick into the, as Mark said, when you really feel it, is a few years out. But we'll keep giving you the proof points of things as we're going, so it's not a just trust us that it’ s coming, you'll begin to see it build.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "The second thing I'd point out, as I just mentioned to the prior question, is that we're continuing to invest in risk and controls and in the transformation over this period of time.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "In terms of the spread products, we've been putting our financing and securitization business as part of our simplification, fully within Markets, so that we've created a unified, scaled spreads product business. And then finally, equities, where we're focused on improving our prime offering, building balances. We still have a way to go obviously in that. Prime balances we're pleased they were nicely up this year, driven by client momentum. And we're a leading equities derivative franchise. So, you do have these four core businesses.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "And I'd go back to our big point of differentiation and why we feel we're well-positioned. We have a very differentiated corporate client base and very strong partnerships between our core Markets franchise, TTS, and Banking and Securities Services, and that helps us in FX, in commodities and in rates around the world. So, Markets is important both in terms of its leadership, but also, how it fits into the strengths that we have from this simpler Citi of those five core interconnected businesses.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "We've demonstrated solid returns in the past. I think a lot of the actions we've been taking will help drive returns in the future. And you should be getting confidence when you see the discipline we're putting on to RWA, 5.3%, getting close that target, we said at Investor Day. We're moving that up to 6%. The exits we've got of nonstrategic businesses shows our focus on efficiency. And we've also been doing some good investments in our technology, and that's getting us into a good place there. So, I think, don't be concerned about the shrinking. We're just making sure that it really plays to our strengths and we optimize the returns.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Very good, I appreciate that. And then, Jane, more of a qualitative question rather than quantitative, but obviously, there's numerous moving parts of the strategies that you guys are executing on, exiting businesses, downsizing businesses. Especially on the downsizing, I think you guys mentioned, the head count of about 20,000 coming down. How do you keep the morale of the organization elevated when you have these types of tough decisions that you all have to make?\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Yes. Well, we've also got areas which are growing, so that does help, too. We have a diversified portfolio here. I think we're very mindful of, that there is a human impact of the decisions that we're making. We're trying to be as transparent with our people, as we are with our investors about what we need to do, why we're doing it, what to expect and laying that out so people understand the logic behind the decisions, and then they understand what the decisions are as quickly as they can. I think that's the most humane way to do this.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "If you think about Citi, we have a differentiated global business model, and that means we're committed to the countries in which our multinational clients operate over the long run. So, that means we hold long-term capital in those countries, upon which we generate solid returns through the cycle. And let me just point to our leading Services and FX businesses are the heart of that network, and they're generating double-digits, as you can see.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "And I think similarly, if I just touch on Argentina for a minute, because I'm sure, folks have got a few questions on that. Similarly, over the last several years, we've de-risked our business model there. We don't have a consumer bank, so we've really reduced down our emerging markets exposures to just our institutional presence, focused on the multinational clients, you've heard us talk about that, and select high-grade local clients.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Then, there's a lot of optimism and debate around capital markets rebound. Are you seeing that? And can you help update us on Investment Banking pipeline across M&A, ECM, DCM?\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Yes. We certainly had a much more constructive market environment to the end of 2023. Interest rate spreads and volatility at lows for the year. Equity prices are high. And I think we view this as a helpful foundation for activity to accelerate in 2024, assuming the tailwinds persist.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "And speaking of our own pipeline, the breadth, the depth, the quality of it's very sound. It's higher than it was pre-COVID. So when markets are constructive, we expect to move these opportunities forward. And we're hearing a lot more confidence from the CEOs, CFOs around this.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "And yeah, we're looking at our own side. As you know, we've been investing in some higher-growth areas, so we get a good balance between our traditionally strong sectors as well as high-growth areas. And we've been seeing some very good momentum in healthcare and technology, as well as areas of traditional strength, which is energy and industrial.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "And I think we feel very confident in the recovery in DCM. The beginnings of one in LevFin. And so, cautiously optimistic here. So I wouldn't say that it's going to accelerate enormously and with incredible speed, but I think we're feeling much better about the foundation. Mark, anything you'd add?\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Okay, no, no we haven't. I think a lot of the moves that we've made from the organization simplification, so the 5,000 or so roles we talked about, they're mainly managerial roles. And they've mainly impacted the functions and the geographies, not nearly so much the revenue from revenue generators.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "And the other piece is with the client organization, we're actually putting much more time into the hands of our people to drive revenue forward, so I think what we're looking at here is getting rid of areas of bureaucracy and where we've been too complicated, where we can drive efficiency whilst preserving our frontline and encouraging them to be as revenue-productive and delivering the full force of the firm to the client. So I like to see the opposite actually.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Then, when we think about where are other expense opportunities on top of this, as Mark was talking about earlier, the stranded costs, we'll be completing the elimination of the stranded costs from the divestitures. We'll be continuing, and you've seen us –  been continuing that, exiting marginal businesses and hobbies and the like and being very disciplined about that.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "We've got some businesses where we feel we need to right size the core expense base. Andy Sieg is going to be kicking off that in Wealth, and you'll begin to see some of the impact of that in the first quarter. He's off to a strong start. And then, we've got others where we'll be creating more utilities. We've still got different fragmented activities across the firm that the organization simplification has highlighted. We'll be aggregating those, creating utilities, or are consolidating some of those different functions. And that is before we get to, beginning to get benefits from the transformation, where there'll be efficiencies that come through.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Thank you, Jenn, and a very good morning to everyone. I am going to start with the macro backdrop, and then walk you through our results for the full year. I will share some thoughts on the progress we are making executing our strategy and then conclude with why we have decided to adjust our 2026 return target.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "We attracted top talent throughout the year in Wealth, most recently bringing in Kate Moore as our CIO and Anne McCosker as our Head of Lending.  This business has tremendous potential with both new and existing clients, and we are really leaning into it.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "To align our structure with our strategy, we went through a significant simplification of our organization, removing management layers and the regional construct.  This has accelerated decision making and made us a better partner to our clients.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "We have strengthened our culture by better aligning compensation with our shareholders’ interests, enhancing our scorecards to ensure we are delivering for clients. We attracted top industry talent throughout our organization and that includes new leaders around my table for Banking, Wealth and Technology.   We have raised the bar on what we demand from each other and what we expect to deliver to our clients.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "We have continued to innovate to improve the client experience and our efficiency.  We are now live with Citi Payments Express in 18 countries, and have converted four million retail bank customers to our Simplified Banking platform in the U.S.  We accelerated our use of AI, arming 30,000 developers with tools to write code and launched two AI platforms to make 143,000 colleagues more efficient.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "We have made considerable progress on our Transformation.  While there are areas that are more advanced, there are others where we still have a lot more work to do, particularly around data and regulatory reporting, as last summer’s regulatory actions reinforced. We have reviewed the entire data program and made changes to its governance and structure as well as increased the level of investment.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "However, when we take the required investments into account, we now expect our 2026 RoTCE to be between 10% and 11%. The 2026 RoTCE is a waypoint; it is not a destination.  Our intention is to continue to improve returns well above that level and we are accountable for doing so.  We are relentless in our determination to run the bank more efficiently, fulfill Citi’s potential and meet the expectations of our shareholders.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Before I turn it over to Mark, I’d like to acknowledge the catastrophic wildfires in Los Angeles. Many of our clients and several of our colleagues have lost their homes and we will do whatever we can to help them recover from this devastating event.  They and their loved ones are in all of our thoughts at Citi.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Thanks, Jane and good morning, everyone. I am going to start with the fourth quarter and full-year financial results, focusing on year-over-year comparisons unless I indicate otherwise. I’ll also focus on our current expectations for 2025 and 2026.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Embedded in our outlook for the year is roughly $600 million for repositioning, which remains elevated, as we continue to reduce stranded costs, drive efficiencies across the businesses and as benefits from investments in Transformation and technology allow us to eliminate manual processes. As Jane said, we recognize that our expense base remains elevated. And we remain very focused on bringing down our expenses each year while ensuring that we have enough capacity to invest in the company.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Now turning to slide 21, I’ll talk through our expectations for returns going forward.  As we enter 2025 and think forward to 2026, we continue to have a clear path to improved returns. Having gone through another robust planning process, and having provided revenue and expense targets for 2025, we want to update our 2026 RoTCE target range.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "We will maintain strict discipline on the entire expense base, looking for more opportunities to drive further efficiencies as we go into 2026.  We also remain laser focused on continuing to optimize RWA but as you know, the future of capital rules and therefore requirements remain uncertain. In light of all of this, we are now targeting an RoTCE in the range of 10 to 11% in 2026.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "As we take a step back, 2024 represents another year of solid progress and a set of proof points towards improving firmwide and business performance, as well as continued execution against our Transformation. And as we enter 2025, these priorities remain critical as we continue to make progress on improving our returns.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Happy New Year, Jim. I know you want to talk about the guidance, so let me put it into context here. Last year, you've heard me be very clear about our two priorities. First one is driving the business performance and the second is executing the Transformation. You've seen this quarter, you've seen last quarter, you've seen the full year our businesses are delivering the progress we wanted them to.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "We said Services as a crown jewel. It's delivered growth, high returns, it's taken share. It's a crown jewel. We made a strategic play in Wealth, and you've seen us very steadily prove out why we can be a force globally with a clear path to delivering the financial performance that we said we would do. We've consistently delivered on our revenue and expense targets. And I see a lot more opportunity and more upside to strengthen our business performance. We're very tangibly getting after it. We're pretty excited by it.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "The second priority, Transformation. I've got to tell you, I'm broadly pleased with the progress we've made in risk and compliance and accountability. Kind of excited by the work we've got going on in controls for the business as well at the moment. We've been very transparent. Data is an area we have more work to do in. We increased our investments last year, as you know. And then as part of the annual planning process, we took a big step back to reassess our plan. And I decided, along with Mark and the management team, we needed to expand the scope and accelerate some of the work to satisfy our regulators' expectations.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "I'm confident that the decision to do that, it was the right one. It's the right one for our Transformation efforts, it’s certainly the right one for the firm overall. I could have taken a short-term decision to cut other investments that are important for our long-term competitiveness, I'm just not going to do that. You shouldn't want me to do that. And as I said in the opening comments, this 2026 target is a waypoint, not the final destination.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "I just want to address the second part of your question, Jim, in terms of the path to the less than 60%. I think Jane framed it out quite nicely in that we're building a franchise that will have continued and sustainable top line revenue momentum. We are focused on driving out the inefficiencies and stranded costs and Legacy Franchise expenses from the organization and the benefits from these investments we've made in the Transformation will yield a lower cost structure over time as well. And so the combination of those things will get us to that targeted operating efficiency as we come out of 2026 at less than 60%. So yes, there is still a path, and we are focused on that path.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Thank you. Mark, just wanted to follow up on your answer to Jim right there. So when you look at the 10% to 11% RoTCE target for 2026. Is that kind of assuming you'll be around the target or like using the 13.1% as the target? And then longer term, you hope to bring that target down as rules get clarified and the franchise gets simplified?\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "On expenses, Mike and everyone, expenses are a focus not just for Mark and I, but for the entire management team. We're making sure that focus and discipline is really getting installed and instilled into the DNA of Citi. And you've seen that, as you referenced, we've been meeting our expense guidance over the last couple of years, we've been driving positive operating efficiency.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "We're all very focused on improving our operating expense base. Consolidating technology, the simplification work, automation, getting different utilities put in place rather than fragmented around the firm, using AI tools now our, location strategy, right? So that core operating expense base is something that we're really looking at how do we drive to be more efficient, more modern and getting it to the level it should be for the revenues that we generate.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "We all want Transformation to get done quickly, and we want it to get done right. So that is why our expenses are temporarily elevated to make the investments that needed there. This is not all run rate.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "And as you say, as CEO, I will not sacrifice the right long-term investments in our growth and competitiveness for short-term expediency. This is a way point. It's not a destination. And we know what we need to do. We've got our arms around all of this, we're just getting on with execution.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "So we have some great growth opportunities. I look at the different areas. I'm excited by what we see in Wealth. We've got a great runway with our clients who want to do business with us in Banking.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "I guess maybe, Jane, I wanted to follow up on a couple of segments. I think you said 2024 turning point for Wealth, and we've seen very steady progress on the RoTCE in Wealth. Just talk to us in terms of, Andy Sieg’s being in the seat for a year now, you've seen progress. What needs to happen? Just talk to us a little bit about the franchise positioning competitively both in the U.S. and abroad as you think about going head-to-head with some of your global competitors and where are the most likely growth opportunities over the next year or two?\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Yes. So, our vision, my vision is that we become a global leader in wealth management. There are not many firms that have the globality of Citi. We have all the assets, especially the client relationships all around the world, which were just not tapped for investments in the past. It's a big opportunity. We have $5.3 trillion “off us” from existing clients. And I think the fact that I would find interesting is 55% of it, it's almost $3 trillion with affluent clients in our branch network in America, in the U.S.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "We're also very well-positioned to capture new wealth, just think about what Citi does in terms of our footprint, our capabilities really supports the wealth creation, from the Commercial Bank, our Investment Banking side, Markets, obviously, Services supporting it, too. These are all great feeders for us to strengthen wealth relationships with our clients.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "What I have also got to love is the surgical approach that he's taking to the expense base and driving productivity, something that we're doing across the firm. I'm also excited by the talent he's bringing, in the market leaders like Kate Moore and Keith Glenfield in the investment space.  And we've made a lot of investments in training and building this investment culture that we didn't have before.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "So when Vis joined, the mandate, a bit similar to Andy, becoming a top three investment bank, deliver the full potential of One Citi to our clients. So we've got a lot of upside there, instilling some more discipline in capital allocation, client coverage, some of the cross-firm linkages. We're getting a lot more from our people. We've been bringing in some great new talent we've also been cutting some of the unproductive spend.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Got it. And just my second question, as we think about 2026. And again, I don't want to put words in your mouth because clearly, it's very critical in terms of your targets and hitting them. So you targeted less than $53 billion. Is it fair to assume like Jim was asking that $51 billion to $53 billion is not the target, but it's less than $53 billion? But to that end, I mean just taking a step back, I think, Jane, you said something very important in that want to get to the returns in a sustainable way. And clearly, your shareholders are scarred by previous management when the returns went up to double digits and went back tumbling down and wasn't sustainable. And should we just really think of this as, look, like it takes a while to turn around a money center bank and 2026 may have been the target in 2022, but we're going to get there in 2027, 2028 anyway, and just doing this in a sustainable way, and we're not robbing the bank of investments.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Retail Services being forensically focused on improving the partnership economics and driving top line growth. And then Retail Banking, there we're driving primary checking growth, we’ve put in simplified banking, so we get a much more streamlined customer proposition that's driving more of a relationship-based banking approach as opposed to a transactional one.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "And so there are puts and takes, but Transformation and technology specifically, we are continuing to invest in, in order to achieve what we need to get done here and also ensure the businesses have what they need to drive sustainable growth going forward.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "And I guess, like how do you know that the recent increase that you're modeling internally in these areas, how do you know you're spending enough and in the right ways to address your goals in the Transformation and also satisfy the regulatory requirements?\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Hi, this is your first full year of having the five line of business structure. So, Mark, do you still have the same line of business targets that you had last year? And Jane, with all the, it must have been a degree of hell to organize this way, get rid of your two intercompany holding companies, eliminate five layers of management, expand span of control and you guys went through a lot last year. And I'm just wondering, is the worst over in terms of that kind of reorganization internally and the culture and the sentiment and how you see that continuing? But first, the concrete question about the targets, please.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "So I guess I'll start first. So in terms of the targets, look, we set the targets across each of the lines of business for the medium term. We've obviously brought down the 2026 to 10% to 11%. And so you'd imagine there's some movement, at least for the 2026 in terms of those targets, Banking will likely be a little bit lower than the mid-15%, if I think about 2026 as being that medium-term target date. But over time, I expect that the targets that I've set are the targets that we will achieve and even more because, as Jane mentioned, 10% to 11%, while that's our 2026 target, it is not our longer-term target as we think about RoTCE and the strength of these businesses in the aggregate franchise. So hopefully, that answers your question.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Now back to the quarter, touching on a few highlights.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "In terms of the outlook, the dynamics remain the same: our pipeline is relatively robust, but conversion is sensitive to market conditions and the economic outlook.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "So to wrap up, our strong results this quarter once again highlight the earnings power of this diversified franchise.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "We have benefited from our fortress principles and commitment to invest, which we will continue to do as we head into an increasingly uncertain environment.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "And I think it should be done knowing what you want the outcome to be.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "And as you said, we're getting a lot of positive feedback from the field on our product offerings.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "And I'll just remind you that at a conference in February, I suggested that we were already starting to feel like some of the uncertainties we mentioned when giving the guidance had started all moving in the same direction, and that was one of the things that contributed to the upward revision, like all of the uncertainty kind of went the same way.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "But as Jamie's pointed out – those uncertainties are all still there, we highlight them on the page, and as we look forward to this year and to next year and the medium-term we remain very focused on those.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "I think we feel really good about how the company is positioned for a recession, but we're a bank.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "A very serious recession is of course going to be a headwind for returns, but we think even in a fairly severe recession, we'll deliver very good returns – whether that's 17% or not is too much detail for now.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "And you'll remember last year that even though we did predict an increase, we were off by almost a factor of two in terms of how big it wound up being, and that was a big surprise for the whole industry.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Yes, Jamie, has also mentioned all the re-fi dynamics that you mentioned too are something that the office space is processing one way or the other.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Those exposures will be in multiple parts of the economy. I say to all of our clients – now would be the time to fix it.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "It's kind of earnings in store – you get to deploy it later and maybe at a more opportune time, when the time comes.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "And I would say that if you look at the evolution of our outlook last year, it was pretty clear that we were very asset-sensitive, certainly in terms of the sort of one year forward EaR type measure.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "And we're also peering ahead, looking at those little bit of storm clouds so we're going to be kind of cautious.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "So we're going to make this decision every day. We also don't like to tell the market what we're doing, just so you know.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "And I would just remind you that there are a lot of different levers, so when the NPR comes, that's only going to be a part of it, there's going to be other pieces – the holistic review.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "And there were supposed – I just remembered, there were supposed to be pauses in there about how they looked at banks relative to the global economy, which are getting smaller.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "You're seeing a lot of the private equity do the life insurance companies, and I expect that we're going to come up with a whole bunch of different things over time. And we'll shed certain assets, too.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "In terms of the outlook, while we're encouraged by the level of capital markets activity we saw this quarter, we need to be mindful that some meaningful portion of that is likely pulling forward from later in the year.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Similarly, while it was encouraging to see some positive momentum in announced M&A in the quarter, it remains to be seen whether that will continue and the Advisory business still faces structural headwinds from the regulatory environment.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Dialogue is quite good. A lot of interesting different types of conversations happening with global firms, multinationals, carve-out type things. So, dialogue is good. Valuation environment is better, like sort of decent reasons for optimism there. But of course, with ECM, there's always a pipeline dynamic and conditions were particularly good this quarter. And so, we cautioned a little bit there about pull-forward. Which is even more acute I think on the DCM side, given that quite a higher percentage of the total amount of debt that needed to be refinanced this year, has gotten done in the first quarter. So, that's a factor.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "And then, the question of M&A I think is probably the single most important question, not only because of its impact on M&A, but also because of it's knock-on impact on DCM through acquisition, financing and so on. And there is the well-known kind of regulatory headwinds there and that's definitely having a bit of a chilling effect. I don't know, I've heard some narratives that maybe there is like some pent-up deal demand. Who knows how important politics are in all this? So, I don't know.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "We're fundamentally, as I said, I think on the press call, happy to see momentum this quarter. Happy to see momentum in announced M&A. A little bit cautious about the pull-forward dynamic. A little bit cautious about the regulatory headwinds. And in the end, we're just going to fight really hard for our share of the wallet here.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "And so, all of that creates risk management needs and active managers need to grapple with it, and so on and so forth. So, I think that – those are some of the themes on the Market side at the margin. And yeah, we'll see how the rest of the year goes. But it sort of seems to be behaving relatively normally, I would say.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "And in terms of the Wholesale Payments business, it's going great. We're taking share. There's been a lot of innovation there, a lot of investment in technology, a lot of connectivity to payment systems in different countries around the world. And yeah, I'm sure we'll give you more color in other settings on that, but it's a good story. It's a nice thing to see.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "But I think the other piece is that, our willingness to invest which has always been a focus of yours, is one of the key things separating us in this business right now. And so, we are seeing the benefits of that.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Cool. Maybe one other follow-up. You're always investing. You clearly get paid in growth across the franchise as you do. But relative to a lot of other banks that have been keeping the expenses a lot closer to flat, do you envision environment, or maybe I should rephrase that, what type of environment would have J.P. Morgan pull back on this tremendous investment spending wave that you've been going through?\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Could there be some environments that for whatever reason change the business case for certain investments, or even certain businesses, that lead us to make meaningfully different strategic choices? Yes, but that would be because the through-the-cycle analysis has changed for some reason. I just don't see us fundamentally making strategically different decisions if the strategic outlook is unchanged, simply because of the business cycle in the short-term.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "In light of market conditions, we are adopting a cautious stance on the Investment Banking outlook. While client engagement and dialog is quite elevated, both the conversion of the existing pipeline and origination of new activity will require a reduction in the current levels of uncertainty.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "So to wrap up, we're pleased with another quarter of strong operating performance – but of course, the focus right now is on the future, which is obviously unusually uncertain.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "In terms of our corporate clients, obviously, they've been reacting to the changes in tariff policy. And at the margin, that shifts their focus away from more strategic priorities with obvious implications for the Investment Banking pipeline outlook towards more short-term work, optimizing supply chains and trying to figure out how they're going to respond to the current environment.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "So as a result, I think we would characterize what we're hearing from our corporate clients as a little bit of a wait-and-see attitude.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "I do think you see obvious differences across sectors. Some sectors are going to be much more exposed than others and have more complicated problems to solve. And also across the size of the clients, I think smaller clients, small business and smaller corporates are probably a little bit more challenged. I think the larger corporates have a bit more experience dealing with these things and more resources to manage. So that's a little bit our read of the situation right now. But certainly, a bit of a wait-and-see attitude. It's hard to make long-term decisions right now, and so we'll see how that plays out.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Thank you both for that perspective. And just for my follow-up, did want to ask on the Markets outlook. So, admittedly, less surprising to hear some of the cautious IB commentary in light of the uncertainty. But was hoping you could just speak to the Markets businesses which have been performing extraordinarily well of late and just given the combination of elevated volatility, but also some indications that clients are taking down risk, how you expect that business to perform over the coming quarters.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Yeah. It's a good question. As you know, Steve, we're obviously not going to give Markets guidance. Your guess is as good as ours at some level. But the ingredients are the right ingredients. I mean, we've often discussed about how this business, all else equal, benefits from a volatile environment if markets are operating relatively normally, which they more or less have been. Of course, it's not guaranteed. We need to do a good job managing the risk. And yeah, there are states of the world where if our clients are struggling or deleveraging or taking down risk, that could be a headwind for us. So we're going to just do what we always do and try to manage the risk well and serve our clients, but we were certainly happy to see the performance this quarter.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "For most – mostly haven't dealt with this stuff before, and you're going to see a lot of stuff taking place shortly in the next couple of months, and then we'll know.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "...well, whatever. We give guidance and we do our best, and it's contingent on a variety of external variables, and we always make our guidance contingent on that. So in that context...\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Jamie, you've been through many cycles. And I think we're all interested in understanding how you think this next cycle is likely to progress. And I'm wondering, is there anything that you've seen in the past that looks like this, or that you would suggest if any slowdown coming forward, is it more likely to be similar to what kind of prior cycle you've seen?\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "An almost impossible answer. We look at all the cycles. And you know we prepare for a full range of outcomes. We're not – I don't personally like predicting what the future is going to hold. But I do – I've pointed out over and over, there's a lot of issues out there. I think some of those issues, you are going to see them resolve, for better or for worse, in the next four months.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "So maybe when we're doing this call next quarter, we won't have to be guessing. We'll actually know what the effect of some of these things was with some predictability and stuff like that. But it's – the result in a bank is almost always the same, which is volatile markets, credit losses go up, people get more conservative, investments go down, what looks like a recession. Is it mild or hard? I don't know and – but we are – I've been quite cautious, and you can see in our capital, our liquidity, our position, our balance sheet. And so we're prepared. But we do all that so we can serve our clients through thick or thin. We're not guessing about what the future is going to hold. Obviously, if you look at our numbers, we have the margins and capability to get through just about anything.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Yeah. What we've heard from our Markets colleagues is that that's actually functioning quite smoothly.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Hi. Just one follow-up on this whole risk management/regulatory front. I see, I hear and I agree: flawed regulatory system, could be better. We've had massive volatility. The market plumbing has held in okay so far and you and others have had borderline spectacular trading results. So, has something changed? Are the systems better? Are they better able to handle your risk management, your people, the diversity of your platform better? Or are there still environments where not all volatility is good? Just curious to get your big picture thoughts. Thanks.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "I mean, maybe I'll start with that one, Glenn. So, I guess, I think that your points aren't mutually exclusive. Meaning, I mean, we're always continually improving the franchise. We've talked a lot about inward investment in all of our businesses, including Markets. And so we try to be more complete and invest in technology and work more closely with our clients. So I'm sure we're kind of better at it than we were five years ago, as I think probably everyone is at the margin. I'm not sure that you can associate that with the current performance. I think these just happen to be very favorable conditions that we've managed very successfully.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "It's also true that there are conceivably certain investment business cases, which depending on how the environment changes, could no longer make sense analyzed in the same way that we analyze them originally, i.e., through the lens of their ability to generate long-term shareholder value through a long investment cycle. And so if for whatever reason the environment changes in such a way as to make certain of those investments less compelling, we would obviously adjust.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "This quarter, as it happens, a question you might have is how are you managing to keep your guidance the same with what you're saying about, for example, the Investment Banking outlook? But it's worth noting that Investment Banking performance this quarter was actually fine. As you know, Markets performance was very strong. And there are also some ups and downs in there, I should note, including the fact that there is some sensitivity to the expense base to the strength of the dollar, or weakness in this case. And while some of that is offset in revenue, it's a little noisy, so that's a factor as well. It's small, but I'm just highlighting that there's some slightly non-obvious things that are non-strategic, obviously.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "And you can – if you go to – if you read my Chairman's letter, the last section is called Management Learnings. And if you look at companies that over time fail, it's almost always bureaucracy, complacency, arrogance and lack of attention to detail. And so there is – we're making a – I shouldn't say it, but I'm mad at myself for not doing it sooner to spend a little more time that after COVID – the buildup in headcount, the buildup in rules and regulations, the people working or not working from home. After all of those things, we just think there's more efficiency here.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Systems integration is also proceeding apace and we are targeting being substantially complete by mid-2024.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "As the integration continues, some of those items will get allocated across the segments.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "In terms of the second half outlook, we have seen encouraging signs of activity in Capital Markets and July should be a good indicator for the remainder of the year.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "However, year-to-date announced M&A is down significantly, which will be a headwind.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "So to wrap up, we are proud of the exceptionally strong operating results this quarter.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "It seems to be coming in a little better than expected.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "So we're not suggesting that we can price our way out of it, but we obviously need to get the right returns on products and services, and where we have pricing power we will adjust to the higher capital.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "And Erika, I would just add one thing. We do have a mix of businesses that earn from like 0% ROTCE to 100%. We have some which are very capital-intensive so we look at kind of all of them, and I think 17% is a good number and a good target.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "So there are details, there is a lot of the FRTB stuff; we can get way into the weeds there within the Markets business. And we do have a good track record of adjusting and optimizing, but this time around, it may be a more fundamental set of questions around business mix as opposed to the ability to sort of optimize in a very technical way.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Sure. Good question, Ken. So I think in terms of Investment Banking and Markets, yeah, slightly better than expected last month. What I would talk about green shoots especially in Capital Markets generally, still definitely some headwinds in M&A, lower announced activity, some regulatory headwinds there, so we'll see.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "And, yeah, I think the consumer continues to surprise on the upside here.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "So not really a lot of change in our positioning, and that's obviously including the fact that we took on First Republic which, even net of some of the liabilities, had a long structural interest rate position. We did not actually want to get longer as part of the deal, and so as a result we took actions to ensure that net-net we are still about the same as we were last quarter.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "And if the FRTB proposal goes through as currently written, that product just becomes not viable. So, obviously, if we need to stop doing that product, no one really cares. But it's just one example of the way sometimes, when you're really disciplined about allocating capital thoroughly all the way down to individual products and responding accordingly, you can wind up having to change your business mix.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Hi. I had another question on Vice Chair Barr's speech from this week. To the extent that capital ratios do go up 20% for you and perhaps others, to what degree would you think about changing your business model in terms of remixing where you do business, repricing or simply removing activities that you used to do?\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "And if the repricing is not successful, then in some cases we will have to remix and that means getting out of certain products and services.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Alright, and separate question. I appreciate the Investor Day – gives a little bit more color on the degree that your investments may or may not pan out; we are still all watching that closely.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "But I think more broadly on benchmarking ourselves to low-cost providers, it sort of speaks to an area that you've been interested in for a long time which is all of the investment that we're doing in technology to improve generally scalability and get more of our cost base to be variable versus fixed in terms of how we respond to volumes – that's a big part of the reason that we're doing the investments that we're doing, and modernization and cloud and AI and all the type of stuff that we've talked about a lot.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "So I think we feel really good about our efficiency as a company, but there definitely is room for improvement.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Just to give a couple examples, like in Consumer, we've got some of our branch expansion markets seasoning and so there are share opportunities there.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Yeah. Matt, it's really just about primary bank relationships in the end. That's the core of the strategy.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "As you know, we completed CCAR a couple of weeks ago and have already disclosed a number of the key points. Let me summarize them again here.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "In terms of the outlook, we're pleased with both the year-on-year and sequential improvement in the quarter. We remain cautiously optimistic about the pipeline, although many of the same headwinds are still in effect.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "And, as always, we remain focused on continuing to execute with discipline.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "So, when we think of our balance outlook, we see it as flat to slightly down maybe with our sort of market share and growth ambitions offsetting those system-wide headwinds.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "In terms of dialog and engagement, it's definitely elevated. So, the dialog on ECM is elevated, and the dialog on M&A is quite robust as well. So, all of those are good things that encourage us and make us hopeful that we could be seeing sort of a better trend in this space.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "But there are some important caveats. So, on the DCM side, yeah, we made pull-forward comments in the first quarter, but we still feel that this second quarter still reflects a bunch of pull-forward and therefore, we're reasonably cautious about the second half of the year. Importantly, a lot of the activity is refinancing activity as opposed to, for example, acquisition finance.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "So, the fact that M&A remains still relatively muted in terms of actual deals has knock-on effects on DCM as well. And when a higher percentage of the wallet is refied, then the pull-forward risk becomes a little bit higher.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "And while secondary market performance of IPOs has improved meaningfully, in some cases people still have concerns about that. So, those are a little bit of overhang on that space. I think we can hope that over time that fades away and the trend gets a bit more robust.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "And, yeah, on the advisory side, the regulatory overhang is there, remains there, and so, we'll just have to see how that plays out.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "So, we feel optimistic about our offering there. I think the current environment is maybe a little bit quieter than it was. So, it's maybe not a great moment to, like kind of test whether we're doing a lot more or less in the space, so to speak.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "No. That's great for you if you're not hearing much about it, so we can leave it at that. Maybe just one quick follow-up in terms of your just overall posturing. You were patient and smart when rates were low, waited to deploy, worked out great, we know that story. Now, it seems like you have tons of excess liquidity and you're being patient and rates are high, and I'm curious on how you think about what kind of triggers, what kind of things you're looking for in the market to know if and when you would extend duration.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Yeah. I mean, I think in short, Mike, and we've talked about this a lot and Jamie's talked about this a lot, it's a very, very, very competitive market, and we're very happy with our performance. We're very happy with the share we've taken, and 17% is like an amazing number actually.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "So, you have to assume there will be some upward pressure on that. But in any given quarter, the C&I numbers tend to be quite lumpy and quite idiosyncratic. So, I don't think that anything in the current quarter's results is indicative of anything broader, and I haven't heard anyone internally talk that way, I would say.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "So, there's always a balance between capital deployment and assessing economic risk rationally and frankly, that is, in some sense, a microcosm of the larger challenge that we have right now. When I talked about if there was ever a moment where the opportunity cost of not deploying the capital relative to how attractive the opportunities outside the walls of the company are, now would be it in terms of being patient. That's a little bit one example of what I was referring to.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Thanks, Jamie. And of course, I very much echo the sentiment. Now let's turn to our third quarter earnings results. The presentation is available on our website and please refer to the disclaimer in the back.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "And of course, given the absence of a fix to the GSIB flaws it continues to present a headwind into the indefinite future.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "In terms of the outlook, we're encouraged by the level of capital markets activity in September, and we have a healthy pipeline going into the fourth quarter.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "So to wrap up, we're pleased with another quarter of strong operating results.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Sure. Thanks, John. I think the themes are pretty much the same as we've seen in prior quarters.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "So, as we talked a little bit about on the press call, we've been trying to be a little bit cautious about recognizing that we don't think the current levels are sustainable and we do think that we'll have to reprice in some pockets to some degree, maybe tiering or whatever at some point in the future. And, of course, that hasn't happened yet this year, so that's one factor.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Hi. Jeremy, I was hoping to just inquire about the capital markets outlook. You cited improved activity levels in September. But given persistently higher rates, geopolitical tensions, and just poor performance of recent IPOs, how are you thinking about the outlook over the near to medium term? And how are you thinking about just the timing of an inflection activity?\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "So it feels to me like a little bit of a slow grind with some positive momentum but obviously significant uncertainty in the outlook and some structural headwinds given lower levels of announced M&A and some regulatory headwinds on that side.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "And so talking a lot about optimizing away stuff that might change just feels like a bit premature at this point.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "And the broader answer to your question about why we're able to be effectively really comes back to a decade, two decade long history of investing for the future and recognizing that there's a holistic value proposition here that includes branches, and the app, and all of the online services, and the entire suite of products and services that is around this enterprise which drives engagement and customer loyalty.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Hi. Thank you. So I very much appreciate the comments in the release on the big picture things, what's going on in the world and their potential impact on markets, on food markets, global trade, everything that you mentioned, and sadly agree about the most dangerous time in decades. The question I have is, does it surprise you that markets are hanging in, that you, yourself, have green shoots or still green shoots type of mindset about banking while that's going on? And then maybe more importantly, if you believe what obviously what you wrote, what are you doing about it? How do you manage yourself conservatively? How do you prepare for tougher times?\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "You want to start? Okay. So, I mean, on green shoots, you'll just note that our comments are cautious. I mean, there is momentum. I do think we are a little bit more optimistic than we were, but obviously, markets have been bumpy, both equity markets and rate markets have been very whippy recently.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "So we don't want to get too carried away with optimism here. We are coming in off a very low base and so there's a hope and an expectation that we are on the path to normalization and improvement.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "And like I said, the other thing about the green shoots, regardless of that, we try to run the company so that we serve the clients day in and day out, better products and better services, securely, safely, and all those things, so that's the ultimate goal.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Younger generations have different expectations, and we have to be nimble, and we have to be on our front foot. And otherwise, we risk getting severely disrupted. So I don't know if Jamie wants to add anything.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Just the competition, when we look at it, it's Wells, who's coming back, which I'm happy for you guys. It's obviously Marcus, it's Apple, it's Chime, it's Dave. There are a lot of people coming up after these businesses in different ways, and there some have been quite successful. It's Stripe in payments.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "I think we're still kind of in the ballpark, but I would say at the margin there's going to be a little bit of upward pressure.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Yeah, this is all now including First Republic. And I think there will be a little bit of upward pressure on that as we sort of do our usual thing and look at all of the opportunities that we see and the investments that we want to make. So no surprise in that sense that we're going to invest prudently. Nothing dramatic, but probably a little bit of upward pressure at the margin.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Yeah. And I think that last point of Jamie's is particularly important because, sure, if you want, you can construct what I would consider a very optimistic argument that the higher cost of doing business will lead smaller scale players to exit and that's a share gain opportunity for us, but if I refer back to the comments about the disincentives to beneficial diversification and scale, getting bigger, especially in markets is quite expensive from, for example, a GSIB perspective, and so you wind up kind of hemmed in on all sides which is one of the reasons why we're sort of highlighting, but it does seem like the only way out, sometimes, when you look at the cumulative effect of everything that's happened in markets over the last 15 years, is a fundamentally very different system, and while obviously...\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "And the goal is to make sure that those other things are sized appropriately to what we believe sustainable through the cycle returns are. So we're always very focused on cost. You can be rest assured of that. That discipline internally is as aggressive as ever as we go through the budget cycle. But there are long-term plays and you really shouldn’t expect us to see trying to generate cosmetically lower costs in response to a lower revenue environment where we didn’t balloon the costs when the revenue became as we’ve argued unsustainably high.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "And yeah, in terms of how it's going overall and deepening the relationships, that remains a focus and I think more of that will happen as we continue the integration and we continue stabilizing.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "And yeah, I think as I said on the press call, things are going well arguably a little bit better than we'd sort of modeled as part of the acquisition, and we're happy to see that.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "In light of the positive momentum throughout the year, we're optimistic about our pipeline, but the M&A regulatory environment and geopolitical situation are continued sources of uncertainty.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "So, to wrap up, we're pleased with another quarter of strong operating performance. As we look ahead to the next few quarters, we expect results will be somewhat challenged as normalization continues, but we remain upbeat and focused on executing in order to continue delivering excellent returns through the cycle.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "In terms of priorities and investments, really nothing has changed, like the strategy hasn't changed. The strategy hasn't changed and the plans haven't changed and we're just kind of executing with the same long-term perspective that we've always had.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Okay. First of all, when you say dominant, I'd be very careful on that. We've got some very tough competition, different in different countries, different around the world, fintech companies, direct lenders and I want to give you a very specific comment on direct lending and stuff like that. So our goal is always to serve our clients. And when I talk about some of these expenses, that is a deployment of capital, and it's a deployment in a different way.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "So maybe you could talk about what things you're working on and why that's too narrow of a view of your ability to serve all parts of clients’ lending needs, not just the public markets and public lending side. Thanks.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Yeah. So let me take time to cover this one, because obviously it has become very important. People talking about how they're growing and partnering and things like that.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "And so first and foremost – I’m going to talk about very strategic and then very tactical, I think they're both important. First and foremost, we are here to give our clients an agnostic view of the world and what the best product and services are for them. Therefore, when a client comes in, we will offer them both direct lending, ourselves, and syndicated lending or other specialized kind of lending. And they all have pluses and minuses.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Direct lending could be done faster, maybe simpler covenants, unitranche. It is more expensive and you're just seeing a little things go back and forth between syndicated lending and direct lending. But we're going to offer the clients basically what's in their best interest and tell them what those products are across the venue.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "So if you look at the arbitrage today, where a bank has to hold for things, where insurance could, they are dramatically different. That's a disadvantage, but we've had those disadvantages in other businesses for a long time. We are going to do what's right for the client. Remember, when we do business with a client, we also get other revenues off of them. So it isn't just the loan; we look at the whole relationship. So we're quite comfortable we can compete. I just announced much bigger lending platforms and sizes and stuff like that, so I hope if any of the press is on they heard this too.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "And I do think, Gerard, it depends a lot on what type of loans you're talking about, right? So I think in the end, as Jamie says, like it's capital. We're going to deploy it ideally to grow the franchise organically, and that could include loans that are almost good loans on a stand-alone basis, as well as loans that are part of an overall relationship, what we're getting other revenue as part of that. So it's the same strategy that we've always had, but I wouldn't think of it as like excess capital to be deployed against a particular product. I would think of it as it's there for a rainy day. Let's hope the environment doesn't deteriorate a lot, but if it does, we'll be ready. And there will be opportunities hopefully to deploy it against a client franchise or against a stock. And if not, we'll return it. But not now.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Now those firms are, in many cases, also clients. And that's the same type of dynamic that you see, for example, in the private credit space that we've discussed before. So there's no question that the ecosystem is changing. You've got new competitors. You've got changes in market structure, new dynamics. And as with any business, we are innovating and adjusting and making sure that we're prepared to compete in all the traditional ways and all the new ways.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "And side point, it's just another reason why it's important to look at the whole framework holistically when we think about the regulatory response of the events of two springs ago. You don't want those types of spikes and it raises some questions about why there isn't more readiness to deploy into those types of disruptions, albeit this one was relatively minor.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Very good returns in business in both Banking & Wealth Management. We're growing market share. And when we build branches and stuff like that, we don't necessarily assume current margins. We look at what would be normal margins over time. And we're very comfortable doing very nice business for you all.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "We are starting the year with a healthy pipeline, and we are encouraged by the level of capital markets activity, but announced M&A remains a headwind, and the extent as well as the timing of capital markets normalization remains uncertain.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Yeah. Mike, thanks for the question. And yeah – and of course, you will, as I noted, be hearing more from us at Investor Day and between now and Investor Day. But I will take a little bit of extra time here to answer your question, because you're right, it's important to give you the transparency. And I'm going to follow the structure that we used on the page and go through each line of business.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "So, I think that – I think of this as being a little bit barbelled, where on the one hand, we're very excited about this. There's clearly some very significant opportunities, not for nothing, starting with technology developers themselves in terms of the opportunity for significantly increased productivity there. At the same time, we're JPMorgan Chase. We're not going to be chasing shiny objects here in AI. We want to do this in an extremely disciplined way, it's very commercial and very linked to tangible outcomes. And so, the current focus is on making sure we have a contained, well-chosen list of high-impact use cases and that we're throwing resources at those in the right way, that's extremely pragmatic and disciplined, and we're holding ourselves accountable for actual results.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Hey. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. There has been a lot of talk about capital markets rebound. You noted you're starting the year with a healthy pipeline. Could you give us some more color on what you're seeing there and how the rate in – how the change in the rate environment is changing the conversations that you're having across M&A, ECM and DCM?\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Yeah, sure. So, as you know, all else equal, this more dovish rate environment is of course supportive for capital markets. So, if you go into the details a little bit, if you start with ECM, that helps. Higher and – well, the recent rally in the equity markets helps. I think there've been some modest challenges with the 2023 IPO vintage in terms of post-launch performance or whatever. So, that's a little bit of a headwind at the margin in terms of converting the pipeline, but I'm not too concerned about that in general. So, I would expect to see rebound there.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "In DCM, again, all else equal, lower rates are clearly supportive. One of the nuances there is the distinction between the absolute level of rates and the rate of change, that sometimes you see corporates seeing and expecting lower rates, and therefore, waiting to refinance in the hope of even lower rates. So, that can go both ways. And then, M&A is a slightly different dynamic. I think there's a couple nuances there. One, as you obviously know, announced volume was lower this year. So, that will be a headwind in reported revenues in 2024, all else equal. And of course, we are in an environment of M&A regulatory headwinds, as has been heavily discussed. But having said that, I think we're seeing a bit of pick-up in deal flow, and I would expect the environment to be a bit more supportive.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "So, it's really going to be a function of how 2024 plays out. The softer the landing is, the more supported the utilization should be, I would think. If things turn out a little bit worse, I think management teams are going to be incrementally more cautious about CapEx and so on, and so you might see utilization even lower.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "We've made some enhancements and some new initiatives to ensure that we can compete effectively both in our traditional syndicated lending businesses, but also go head-to-head with the private credit providers in these types of unitranche structures, if and when that's what the client actually wants. It tends to be a trade-off between the best possible pricing versus speed and certainty of execution, and we can provide both off our sort of exceptionally strong long-time DCM franchise. So, that's been a priority, and we're actually already starting to see some results from that across both the Commercial Bank and the CIB with certain client segments.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "And so, we really focused on having our guidance be Firmwide, including First Republic, now that everything is embedded in the franchise.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "And taking a step back, we think it's important to acknowledge the tension between the risks and uncertainties in the environment and the degree of optimism embedded in asset prices and expectations. In that context, we remain upbeat about the strength of the franchise, but we are focused on being prepared for a wide range of scenarios.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Finally, let me say a few words about the wildfires in Los Angeles. While we don't expect much of a financial impact from it, we have a presence in the area across all three lines of business, so we're keeping in close contact with our customers, clients and employees. We are offering support in a variety of ways, including waiving consumer and business banking fees as well as making a contribution to local relief organizations, offering employee donation matching and supporting employee volunteer efforts.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Good morning, everybody. I just want to point out that Daniel Pinto is not leaving the company yet, so it's a bit premature what I'm about to do. I just wanted to say and I'd be remiss not to say, he was a young man who joined the company at 20 years old in Argentina. He ran trading in Argentina, then he ran trading for Latin America, then he ran global emerging markets trading, then he ran fixed income trading and then became co-head of the Investment Bank and then sole head of the Investment Bank for 10 years. Over that whole time, helped me build one of the great investment banks in the world. And then, obviously, was President for five years or more; a great partner of mine, trusted by everyone at the company. So we're thrilled to have his skills and talents going forward, but I just wanted to recognize the contributions he made.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "We do have a few top-down areas of focus. I think if I go, for example, into technology for starters, we're putting a lot of effort into improving the sort of ability of our software engineers to be productive as they do development, and there's been a lot of focus on that – the development environment for them, in order to enable them to be more productive. And so all else equal, that generates a little bit of efficiency. We also have a lot of focus on the efficiency of our hardware utilization. And so that's embedded in there as well.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "And another thing that's worth noting, you'll recall that, at Investor Day, I talked about how we had probably reached peak modernization spend. As Jamie always says, we're always modernizing. So, the fact that we've gotten to a peak and then it might come down a little bit from here still means we're going to be constantly modernizing. But, at the margin, that means that inside the tech teams, there's a little bit of capacity that gets freed up to focus on features and new product development and so on, which is also in some sense a form of efficiency.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Finally, though, what I would say is that if you look at the head count trajectory of the company over the last few years, we have grown a lot and it has been for very good reasons. And it has contributed quite a bit to our growth and to our ability to run the company efficiently.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "But any time you have that quantum of headcount growth as well as that rate of headcount growth, you have to believe, all else equal, that some amount of inefficiency has been introduced. And so, this year, as we went through the budget cycle, we ask people, at the margin, to try to support the growth of the company while living within their means on the headcount front. So we're going to try to run things, with some important exceptions that I'll highlight in a second, on roughly flat head count and have that lead to people generating internal efficiencies as they get creative with their teams, and we consider more efficient ways of doing things. The obvious exceptions are the ongoing areas of high certainty investment and growth, so, obviously, branches and bankers and so on. And also, critical non-negotiable areas of risk and control like cyber or whatever independent risk management needs to ensure that we're running the company safely. So that's how we're thinking about efficiency in the current moment.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Who's your successor?\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Okay. And then just separately, a strategic question. There's been some reports about you further expanding the Consumer Banking business globally. And I guess I just want to push on that where we really haven't seen other banks do it in a successful way. Obviously, your approach is kind of coming from a position of strength, leading digitally. But I guess I'm just wondering like is it worth it? Is there enough upside to justify maybe some of the increased regulatory and execution risk of doing global consumer banking?\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "And in terms of the reds and the ambers under the green, I think you know them, right? And they're aligned with our big long-standing investment strategies. The biggest single one arguably is that in what you might call the affluent section of the Wealth Management space, we are significantly underpenetrated relative to the number of households that we bank in the country and our capabilities and our brand and what we think we bring to the table. So, that's why we're pushing so hard on that front, because I think we can get more share there and it completes the franchise very nicely. There are a bunch of examples elsewhere, but we talk a lot about drilling down inside the Markets business, inside Investment Banking and finding the places where even where at the aggregate global sector level we look great and any given region and any given subsector we can do better. And as I mentioned, we continue to look at that as aggressively as ever.\n",
