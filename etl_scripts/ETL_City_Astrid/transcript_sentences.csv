2022,Q1,Glenn Schorr,"But now that you've given us some of the color, I start to understand it.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q1,Glenn Schorr,"So, it feels to me – and correct me if I'm wrong – you just were slower to release the COVID reserves and it sounds like you still have a lot in the coffers with that 7.6% that you mentioned.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q1,Glenn Schorr,"So, I just want to see if you can give a little more color between what you took reserves for, what you released reserves for, and if you tweaked your economic scenarios at all to get to the current reserve, if that's not too much to ask.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,

2022,Q1,Jane Fraser,We were comfortable that this quarter that was the appropriate thing to do given the state of COVID and the US economy.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q1,Jane Fraser,"And as you can see from the numbers, with a 2.35% ACL coverage ratio and with the ratio that we have in Cards, 7.6% in particular, I'm very comfortable that we have a prudent and appropriate reserve level.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q1,Jane Fraser,But let me hand it over to Mark for the down and the dirty.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q1,Mark Mason,Yeah.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q1,Mark Mason,I think you've captured it right in the sense we obviously did a meaningful build related to Russia.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q1,Mark Mason,The majority of the release was in fact tied to the COVID-19 management adjustment that Jane referenced.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q1,Mark Mason,"As we thought about these scenarios, as you know we run a base scenario, we did tweak that a bit in bringing the GDP assumptions down from what they would have been in the fourth quarter, and that obviously also impacted kind of the outer years in our assumption.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q1,Mark Mason,"And the other piece is, when we look the downside scenario – so our analysis for CECL is a combination of a base scenario and a downside scenario.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,

2022,Q1,Jane Fraser,"And I'd just add in, as Mark talked about in his prepared remarks, we took an additional reserve of $900 million for the second and third order impacts of the war and the impacts on supply chains and other pieces that as we look forward we were concerned about for the global economy, it's a huge source of uncertainty as to what that will be.",million,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q1,Mark Mason,Yeah.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q1,Mark Mason,"That's part of the $1.9 billion, obviously.",billion,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,

2022,Q1,Operator,Your next question comes from Erika Najarian with UBS.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q1,Operator,Your line is open.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q1,Erika Najarian,"I just wanted to ask you a question, Jane and Mark, on CET1, and wanted to make sure we get – your investors get the message correctly.",cet1,no,Yes,cet1,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q1,Erika Najarian,"So from the 11.4%, you said that net income capital release from divestitures and DTA utilization are going to be the drivers to build to 12% CET1 by year end 2021.","net income, cet1",no,Yes,cet1,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q1,Erika Najarian,"Obviously, AOCI is a wild card, unpredictable, but perhaps give us a sense of should we then think about the buyback as just a fallout in terms of that equation, right, is the first question.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q1,Erika Najarian,"Number two, what is the desire to increase the dividend even nominally in this stress test year?",,no,No,,No,,No,,Yes,stress test,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q1,Erika Najarian,"And third, how does the DTA impact that was negative in the first quarter turn to a positive impact?",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q1,Erika Najarian,"And Mark, nice job on the RWA.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q1,Erika Najarian,I think that everybody was scared that that was going to be a big negative number this quarter.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q1,Mark Mason,"You got a lot there, Erika, that we've got to unpack, so I'll try to capture it all and you'll point to whatever I may miss.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q1,Mark Mason,"But let's start with the beginning of your question, just kind of the 12% and how we build back up to the 12%.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q1,Mark Mason,"So, we ended the quarter at an estimated 11.4%.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q1,Mark Mason,"To get to the 12%, that'd be somewhere between $7 billion and $8 billion of capital that would be required.",billion,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q1,Mark Mason,"Jane mentioned, I mentioned there are a number of puts and takes that play through that.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q1,Mark Mason,You pointed out a few of them.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q1,Mark Mason,"So, you will have estimates for our net income between the second and fourth quarter, so you can forecast what that would be.",net income,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q1,Mark Mason,There is probably another $1.6 billion or so of a benefit from the DTA.,billion,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q1,Mark Mason,"So, what I mean by that?",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q1,Mark Mason,"There's the $800 million that I've referenced in the past of utilization of the DTA, and the balance would be the elimination of the amount that we tripped above the threshold this quarter.",million,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q1,Mark Mason,"So, there are two components that carry forwards that impact, the DTA and then there is the timing difference which is equated to about 10% of our capital.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q1,Mark Mason,"So, this quarter we actually tripped that timing difference portion of the disallowed DTA, in part because of how the OCI reduction played through.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q1,Mark Mason,"So as that bleeds back in, over time, we would expect to have capital build up which increases that threshold and, therefore, be able to back off the increase that we saw in the quarter related to the DTA.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q1,Mark Mason,The third component would be the capital from exits.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q1,Mark Mason,"So, you didn't mention that one.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q1,Mark Mason,"As you know, there are a number of exits that we're looking to close by the end of the year.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q1,Mark Mason,They'll contribute about $4 billion of capital to that equation.,billion,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q1,Mark Mason,"And then there is the bleeding back in of the OCI impact, which will, give or take, give us another $1 billion.",billion,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q1,Mark Mason,"So, those are the pluses.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q1,Mark Mason,Those are the things that kind of play in on the capital-generation side.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q1,Mark Mason,"And then on the offsets, you've got preferred dividends, you got common dividends, whatever growth we play out or put to work from an RWA point of view, and that leaves the balance for share repurchases.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q1,Mark Mason,"As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we would expect in the second quarter a modest level of buybacks in light of all of those puts and takes.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q1,Mark Mason,"The good news is that the headwinds that we've talked about, all things being equal, so assuming no further rate changes, many of those headwinds bleed back in over time, allowing for us to do what we've committed to, which is returning capital to shareholders over time.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q1,Mark Mason,"In terms of dividends, we always look at that as part of the CCAR submission and part of our broader capital planning, but we'll see how the results come out from CCAR.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,Yes,ccar,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q1,Mark Mason,"But I would lean in on a point we've had to make a number of times now, which is given where we're trading, it makes a lot of sense to be doing buybacks, and so we'll likely continue to lean that way as opposed to doing a lot to change the dividend.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q1,Mark Mason,But stay tuned as the capital planning continues to evolve.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,

2022,Q1,Operator,Your line is open.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q1,Mike Mayo,"Could you talk some about Treasury and Trade Solutions both at the first quarter level – I guess, Securities Services did better, what you're seeing just combination of rates and more corporate demand and the complexity around the global situation.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q1,Mike Mayo,"And then just more generally, the joint calling efforts you guys are doing with lending and payments, so from the specific to the general.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q1,Jane Fraser,"Well, maybe I kick off with a couple of pieces and then hand it over to Mark.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q1,Jane Fraser,"I think what we've seen, frankly, Mike, across the board, this quarter has been the value of our global network that we talked about, be it in Markets we had a lot of strong corporate activities and FX, that we saw tremendous activity for TTS, growing with our commercial banking clients, and we saw a lot of linkages across, and obviously it was a strong quarter for us in trade because, again, with the global network the ability to provide clients with end-to-end solutions in this interesting world that we're living in is something they really rely upon us.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q1,Jane Fraser,"So you saw trade loans up 16%, you saw really many of the drivers that we laid out for you in Investor Day performing particularly strongly.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q1,Jane Fraser,"But, Mark, why don't I pass to you?",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q1,Mark Mason,Yeah.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q1,Mark Mason,I'd make a couple comments.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q1,Mark Mason,"So, one, I'd point out that, again, we had a strong quarter in TTS.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q1,Mark Mason,"The revenues were up 18% versus the prior quarter up – that was year-over-year – versus the prior quarter up 8%, and, yes, some of that was due to rates playing through, so net interest income was up 18%.",net interest income,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q1,Mark Mason,"But look at the noninterest revenue, that was up 19%.",revenue,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q1,Mark Mason,"So to your point, Jane, we're seeing good fee revenue growth play through as well.",revenue,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q1,Mark Mason,"Securities Services had a good quarter as well, it was up 6% revenue year-over-year and part of that was through fee revenue growth as well.",revenue,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q1,Mark Mason,"So as you said good, strong engagement with clients and helping them think through some of the uncertainty that's out here, particularly as it relates to supply chains, helping them work through with their partners through the trade lending growth that we're seeing and making good headway with the commercial client offering as well.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q1,Mark Mason,"So I would say a very good quarter – very strong quarter for TTS, and we expect that momentum to continue.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q1,Jane Fraser,"And, to your question about sort of joint calling effort, we're quite for it – making sure that we're forensically managing the synergies that we talked about cross-calling efforts, and I think Paco and I are both pleased with how those are going, and this quarter was an example of that.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,

2022,Q1,Connor,"I guess, first question, why don't you take just a bigger kind of stab at reserving for maybe the severe stress scenario?",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q1,Connor,"I'm not really an expert on what's going on, but from what I read it – it feels kind of pretty severe and it seems like, broadly speaking, kind of other corporations, not as many banks, but just corporations are taking kind of more material losses versus $1 billion on $10 billion.",billion,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q1,Connor,"And then just a related question, if you could elaborate on what the broader impacts is.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q1,Connor,I guess I'm a little surprised that the reserve for that was as big as the direct Russian reserve or roughly the same.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q1,Mark Mason,Why don't I take that?,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q1,Mark Mason,"So the first thing I'd say is that we're not a $10 billion, right?",billion,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q1,Mark Mason,"So we ended the year last year, 2021, at $9.8 billion.",billion,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q1,Mark Mason,"We ended the quarter at $7.8 billion of exposure, so we brought the exposure down by $2 billion inside of the last three months.",billion,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q1,Mark Mason,I'd also point out that a number of things were important components of that.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q1,Mark Mason,"So if you look at slide 6, you'll see that the loans – and these are both ICG and consumer loans, largely ICG, largely corporate loans – have come down by $600 million, and that's really been a reduction in our risk exposure, right?",million,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q1,Mark Mason,"So borrowers paying down, us limiting the extension of new credit, et cetera.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q1,Mark Mason,"The AFS securities have come down $600 million, and that is really a reduction mostly driven by sales.",million,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q1,Mark Mason,So we've gotten out of those securities.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q1,Mark Mason,"Yes, there are some market-to-market losses, but they're not material.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q1,Mark Mason,"That flows through OCI, not material.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q1,Mark Mason,You can see that the off-balance sheet unfunded commitments have trended down as well.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q1,Mark Mason,"Deposits and cash equivalents have gone up because we've actually seen the repayment of those loans come back, and we've been – we've had to put that cash with the central bank just given some of the restrictions that are there.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q1,Mark Mason,"We've been actively working down the reverse repo assets which are really secured with sovereign bond exposure, and we've been bringing down the third-party cross-border exposure.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q1,Mark Mason,"So a lot of hard work has gone into bringing that exposure down to $7.8 billion, and if you think about the $1 billion that I referenced, it's kind of net of $6.8 billion, right?",billion,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q1,Mark Mason,So the second part of your question was how do we think about reserves and what are those different components.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q1,Mark Mason,"Well, we look at the reserves in terms of the actual name-specific loan exposure we have, how we're rating those entities in this environment, and then we actually run that through our models and we come up with an appropriate reserve tied to that rating.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q1,Mark Mason,So that $1 billion is related to the direct exposure that we have to these Russian clients and entities.,billion,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q1,Mark Mason,The broader impact takes into consideration the spillover effect that might impact other names or other industries outside of Russia due to things like commodity pricing and what have you.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q1,Mark Mason,And then there's a third component that is tied to the global uncertainty that gets created from a dynamic like this.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q1,Mark Mason,So we built the reserves considering those multiple components.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q1,Mark Mason,"The last point I'd make is that when you look at some of the names, there are a significant number of names that are large multinational names that have this exposure in the country, and they provide parental support for some of the exposure that's here as well.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q1,Mark Mason,So we really try to take a detailed comprehensive look at this and build the reserves in a way that we think are prudent recognizing that there are other scenarios that could play out that we want to be prepared for and have a view on as well.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q1,Operator,And our next question – thank you.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q1,Operator,Our next question comes from Gerard Cassidy with RBC Capital Markets.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q1,Gerard Cassidy,"Mark, you did a good job in describing the CET1 ratio walk for us.",cet1,no,Yes,cet1,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,Yes,cet1 ratio
2022,Q1,Gerard Cassidy,"What's new that none of us have experienced yet on an ongoing basis is the SA-CCR, the 49 basis points that reduced your CET1 ratio.",cet1,no,Yes,cet1,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,Yes,cet1 ratio
2022,Q1,Gerard Cassidy,Can you share with us how does that work on an ongoing basis?,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q1,Gerard Cassidy,"Is that a number that's going to stay constant, or does that change every quarter based upon increase or lower risk in this area?",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q1,Mark Mason,Yeah.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q1,Mark Mason,It's an increase in our risk-weighted assets that's really tied largely to the derivative exposures that we have.,risk-weighted assets,yes,Yes,risk-weighted assets,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q1,Mark Mason,What I'd say is obviously how one manages their exposures and balance sheet and engagement with clients will impact that.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q1,Mark Mason,"But importantly, it's a market dynamic that needs to play out as well.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q1,Mark Mason,"So as more RWA and capital is required for these types of positions, there has to – it's going to impact returns and ultimately will impact pricing as the market starts to incorporate this now higher requirement.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q1,Mark Mason,And so it will continue to evolve.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q1,Mark Mason,"The thing I'd point you to is that as we think about managing our businesses and in particular Markets, you would have heard us mention at Investor Day that we're looking – continually looking for opportunities to optimize the balance sheet – optimize RWA, right?",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q1,Mark Mason,And so we talked about targeting our revenue to RWA for our Markets business and we're actively working at that now.,revenue,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q1,Mark Mason,And that's going to be important as we continue to manage not only the balance sheet requirements that we have but our intent to try and return more capital to shareholders and improve our returns.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q1,Operator,Your next question comes from Ebrahim Poonawala with Bank of America.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q1,Ebrahim Poonawala,"Just sticking with capital, a two-part question.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q1,Ebrahim Poonawala,"One, if rates continue to move higher, Mark, is there anything you can do to hedge the AOCI?",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q1,Ebrahim Poonawala,"And secondly, if you can walk us through around Banamex if you do strike a deal at some point this year, what are the implication on capital at deal announcement versus deal close, would appreciate that?",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q1,Mark Mason,"So, look, I mean there – what we've built in – what we've got built into the forecast and the walk back to 12% is the forward curve as of the end of the quarter, so that's what we've built in.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q1,Mark Mason,"As we think about that, that was a pretty sudden move through the quarter, 160 basis points on the two-year in the quarter.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q1,Mark Mason,That's now in the expectation.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q1,Mark Mason,We have built in an assumption around more rate moves that could happen just as a bit of cushion as I think about the outlook and as I think about the walk.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q1,Mark Mason,"We do have hedges in place as it relates to some of the positions that we have and as it relates to OCI, and we'll continue to manage that to ensure we reduce the risk from rate increases, which, by the way, we've been actively doing over the past couple years.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q1,Mark Mason,"If you look at kind of how the balance sheet has evolved, we've been moving from out of AFS and into held to maturity over the past couple years, reducing that risk of a negative impact to OCI.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q1,Mark Mason,"And if you look at the DV01, we've cut that down from as high as $60 million to about $30 million or so.",million,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q1,Mark Mason,"So we've been actively managing with an eye towards how do we reduce that sensitivity, if you will.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q1,Mark Mason,Why don't I let Jane kind of touch on the Mexico piece?,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q1,Jane Fraser,Yeah.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q1,Jane Fraser,"So as I said, it's quite a complex separation and transaction as we're going to be separating our market leading and sizeable ICG franchise in Mexico from the consumer and the small business – business that we'll be selling.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q1,Jane Fraser,It will take a bit of time as we work through this.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q1,Jane Fraser,"It's a fantastic franchise, and as we are starting some very preliminary conversations with the buyers, it's attracting a lot of attention, because it is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity here and we have a range of options I'm sure ahead from IPO sale, et cetera.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q1,Jane Fraser,But this is going to take time.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q1,Jane Fraser,We want to do it properly.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q1,Jane Fraser,"And by time, I mean a few quarters.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q1,Jane Fraser,"So, I think, we're not anticipating at this very early stage whether that would be this year or early next year.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q1,Jane Fraser,"But, Mark, why don't I pass to you in terms of how we look at the CTA impact of that one.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q1,Mark Mason,Yeah.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q1,Mark Mason,"So, look, I mean, as you said, Jane, the – what's going to be important is that we make the right decision for the people, for the business and equally important for our shareholders, and we're going to absolutely make sure we do that.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q1,Mark Mason,"In terms of the way this plays out, as I think you're aware, and I've mentioned before that we've got roughly a $2.8 billion, $2.9 billion currency translation adjustment related to our consumer Mexico franchise.",billion,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q1,Mark Mason,"And so when we sign the deal, we will have that flow through the P&L.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q1,Mark Mason,"It ultimately gets offset at closing, and so, again, you'd have another timing difference between the accounting impact and the ultimate economic impact, but that's kind of the component that would play through at signing, whenever that were to occur.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q1,Operator,And your next question comes from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q1,Operator,Your line is open.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q1,Betsy Graseck,Couple of questions.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q1,Betsy Graseck,"One, a little bit ticky-tacky, but on your NIM sensitivity that you gave in your 10-Q – 10-K, it would be helpful to understand how much of that NIM sensitivity is coming from the non-Legacy businesses, how much that have NIM sensitivity is going to be retained after you sell out the businesses that you've identified?",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q1,Mark Mason,Yeah.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q1,Mark Mason,"I don't have that breakout, Betsy.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q1,Mark Mason,"I mean, I – we'll have to kind of get back to you on that.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q1,Mark Mason,I don't have that breakout.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q1,Operator,And your next question comes from Vivek Juneja with JPMorgan.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q1,Operator,Your line is open.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q1,Vivek Juneja,"A quick question, probably more for Mark.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q1,Vivek Juneja,"The RWA increase from the higher volatility that you'd have seen in your trading assets in the first quarter, what was the offset to that?",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q1,Mark Mason,"So, look, in the first quarter, the major driver that we've seen is really on the credit risk side from an RWA point of view, and that was really tied to SA-CCR.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q1,Mark Mason,"That's the biggest driver of the fourth quarter, the first quarter RWA increase that we've seen.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q1,Mark Mason,So the RWA from a market risk point of view was mostly flat due to reductions in trading book securitizations that was kind of – those are kind of the main drivers there.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q1,Jane Fraser,"And what I'd say is, and you certainly heard this loud and clear from Paco at Investor Day, a lot of the strategy here is also making sure that we're optimizing our capital.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q1,Jane Fraser,"We're very mindful around the returns that we're generating and how we allocate and deploy capital, and this was a quarter that Andy and Paco in running the businesses are being very mindful around that, so that also helped.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q1,Mark Mason,Yeah.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q1,Mark Mason,"So like I said, securitizations would be an offset as would some of the equities derivatives.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q1,Operator,Our next question is from Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q1,Operator,Your line is open.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q1,Steven Chubak,"So, it was encouraging certainly to hear you guys reaffirm the 2022 guidance for a low-single digit revenue growth, mid-single digit expense growth.",revenue,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q1,Steven Chubak,"But just given the positive surprise on revenues in the quarter, the number of rate hikes getting baked into the forward curve has increased since your last update.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q1,Steven Chubak,Want to get some perspective on just why you didn't revise the revenue forecast higher.,revenue,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q1,Steven Chubak,"And just given the pace and timing of investments, as we look ahead to 2023 and beyond, how should we think about the timing for when you guys can get back to positive operating leverage?",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q1,Mark Mason,Yeah.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q1,Mark Mason,"Look, let me kind of take that.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q1,Mark Mason,"So on the revenue side, as you would have heard us describe, there have been puts and takes that have played through the quarter and there is still a fair amount of uncertainty that's out there.",revenue,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q1,Mark Mason,"And so while there have been increases as it relates to rates, and we've seen and expect to see some benefit play through for that, there has also been an impact on banking revenues as we see the uncertainty creating a dynamic where corporate clients are pausing particularly as it relates to equity capital markets and debt capital markets.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q1,Mark Mason,"And so as I mentioned, there are offsets that play out, and so we felt comfortable kind of maintaining the guidance on the revenue top line.",revenue,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q1,Mark Mason,"In terms of the expenses, as I mentioned at Investor Day, the spend that we have going on in expenses is critically important, and we're still growing them as it relates to transformation and as it relates to business led investments.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q1,Mark Mason,"On the business-led investment side, the good news is that we're starting to see some of the top line strength play out, not just driven by rates, but also driven by things like fees, which is what we've forecasted.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q1,Mark Mason,"On the transformation side, we continue to make progress, and we've talked about how critically important that is to our operations going forward.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q1,Mark Mason,"We expect that that will peak or arc, if you will, as we talked about at Investor Day, and that will occur in the near term and will be an important offset, if you will, to the structural expense base that we have as the efficiencies from that spending plays through.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q1,Jane Fraser,"And just to chip in as well, we're committed to the arc of the investments on our transformation and on our growth.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q1,Jane Fraser,We think they're both critically important.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q1,Jane Fraser,We're equally committed to managing our expense base prudently and forensically.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q1,Jane Fraser,"And I think the piece – if there is any comfort from our numbers, is we're getting on with it.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q1,Jane Fraser,We're not hanging around here.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q1,Jane Fraser,You've seen us do that with the divestitures.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q1,Jane Fraser,"We're doing the same on our transformation and on our investment side, getting very focused on making sure we deliver the results you'd expect from them.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q1,Jane Fraser,"You'll see something similar when we start divesting and closing the different transactions, and we'll talk to you about what we're doing on getting those any stranded expenses out and getting focused on that.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q1,Jane Fraser,"So, you can expect us – to see us going pretty aggressively after different elements of our cost base as the timing is appropriate.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q1,Operator,And your next question comes from Ken Usdin with Jefferies.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,

2022,Q1,Operator,If I may move along to the next.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q1,Operator,Next question is from Jim Mitchell with Seaport Global.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q1,Operator,Please go ahead.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q1,Jim Mitchell,Hey.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q1,Jim Mitchell,Maybe just a question on – just following up on the last question.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q1,Jim Mitchell,Do you have a specific update for NII growth this year given the forward curve is substantially higher than 100 basis points and how you're thinking about NII overall?,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q1,Jim Mitchell,"And then as a subset of that, how do we think about your deposit base, your more institutional deposit base acting in aggressive QT environment?",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q1,Mark Mason,"Yeah, sure.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q1,Mark Mason,"Look, I'm not giving kind of guidance kind of broken out, if you will, for the revenues.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q1,Mark Mason,We're standing by the full year guidance that we've talked about.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q1,Mark Mason,"Obviously, with rates moving the way that they have, we would expect that we would see some improvement on the NII line, but I haven't given specific guidance broken out for the two lines.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q1,Mark Mason,"In terms of the deposit base we have, as you know, we've got a mix of consumer and corporate client deposits.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q1,Mark Mason,We skew a bit more heavily towards the corporate client deposit base.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q1,Mark Mason,"That generally comes with a higher beta, and so they're likely to be more reactive to and reactive sooner to the increase in interest rates, and quantitative tightening will certainly have a longer-term impact on the level of deposits that's out there.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q1,Mark Mason,"But with that said, our plans, both in the near term and as we've played out the Investor Day forecast, don't hinge upon significant growth in deposits.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q1,Mark Mason,"We'd expect some growth, but growth consistent with kind of pre pandemic levels, but that's not outsized growth, and we believe our strategy, which is broader than just going after deposits, but really is around solutions for corporate clients and the full spectrum of financial services for the consumers that we focus on will allow for us to capture an appropriate level consistent with how the economy evolves.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q1,Operator,And your next question comes from Erika Najarian with UBS.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,

2022,Q1,Operator,Your next question comes from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,

2022,Q1,Betsy Graseck,"And I just wanted to get a sense as to how you're thinking about the trajectory this year in particular since it's one of the better margin businesses that you've got and it also, obviously, keys into the reserve ratio a bit.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q1,Jane Fraser,Yeah.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,

2022,Q1,Operator,And our next question comes from Andrew Lim with Société Générale.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q1,Operator,Your line is open.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q1,Andrew Lim,So I get the impression that maybe people are surprised by your NII guidance because in the past you've officially given it as based on a run-off balance sheet whereas it appears based on a static balance sheet.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q1,Andrew Lim,"And I think you mentioned a few quarters ago that if it was on the same basis, a static balance sheet, that your NII uplift would be about $2.5 billion to $3 billion for a 100-basis point parallel shift.",billion,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q1,Mark Mason,Yeah.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q1,Andrew Lim,Is that something you're still sticking to?,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q1,Andrew Lim,"And then within the shape of that, how much of that is due to the short-term increasing by 100 basis points?",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q1,Andrew Lim,I think you're much more sensitive to the short term going up.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q1,Andrew Lim,Is that something that you can disclose a rough figure on?,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q1,Mark Mason,Yeah.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q1,Mark Mason,"Yeah, I'd like to separate kind of NII guidance from the IRE sensitivity and disclosure that we have.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q1,Mark Mason,And so you're absolutely right and I'm not moving – we're not moving off of our IRE disclosure at all.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q1,Mark Mason,The analysis is such that with a parallel shift in rates of about 100 basis points that we see somewhere around $2.5 billion to $3 billion of an increase kind of play through.,billion,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q1,Mark Mason,"And as you know or as I've said before, that's across currencies with about two-thirds of that being to non US currencies and the other third, obviously, being US.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q1,Mark Mason,So that is still our view from an IRE point of view.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q1,Mark Mason,We're not – we haven't changed that view.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q1,Operator,And our next question comes from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q1,Mike Mayo,"I guess this is not new, but the expenses are just so high, and we haven't heard the 4% inflation number from others, and maybe others were able to offset that a little bit more.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q1,Mike Mayo,"And the 1% due to volume related, when Jane you mentioned, you don't expect this level's capital markets to be sustained.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q1,Mike Mayo,So I guess I'm just – I'm griping about something that's been around for a while.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q1,Mike Mayo,"I get it, you have the reg order, you have the transformation, you have business sales.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q1,Mike Mayo,You've said you underinvested in the past and everything else.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q1,Mike Mayo,"But, I mean, you have 1,200 basis points between your expense and revenue growth.",revenue,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q1,Mike Mayo,And it just seems so high.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q1,Mike Mayo,"But you're also guiding for what I think is, like, 300 basis points of that spread for the full year.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q1,Mike Mayo,So does that mean this is as bad as it gets and that spread should be narrowed?,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q1,Mike Mayo,"And just some of those other – inflation, volumes, expenses – expenses generally, because it's frustrating for investors.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q1,Mark Mason,Yeah.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q1,Mark Mason,"So, Mike, why don't I take that and kind of try and talk through it.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q1,Mark Mason,So the first thing I'd say is that the 10% growth that we have in the quarter is consistent with the guidance.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q1,Mark Mason,I just want to be clear that in Investor Day that's what we talked about.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q1,Mark Mason,"We would love for the number to be different, but we understand and we know that this is what's required to get the franchise to where it needs to be.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q1,Mark Mason,"And so we're taking those hard decisions, we're spending the money where we need to spend it, we're being diligent about that to make sure that we're not being wasteful in that effort, but we don't want to create or go through the things that we've gone through in the past in the way of underinvesting, and so we're going to avoid that.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q1,Mark Mason,The second thing is – and you acknowledged that kind of in your reference to transformation and business led investments.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q1,Mark Mason,"On the structural investments spend I should say, about half of that is from inflation, so not the full 4%.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q1,Mark Mason,"A portion of it is also from non-consent order, risk and control spend that we're making, things like the financial crime unit, things like cyber spend, things like the work we're doing around our wholesale credit operations, important things.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q1,Mark Mason,And there are some productivity savings that play through that.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q1,Mark Mason,And then the final piece on the volume-related is there are transactional costs that are associated with the activity that we do in the trading side.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q1,Mark Mason,"They're spend that we make in order to drive – in order to drive that activity, and the mix matters.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q1,Mark Mason,"And so while revenues kind of play out in one way for the quarter, the mix of the markets activity impacts the level of volume-related expenses that's generated through those transactions.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q1,Mark Mason,So those are a couple of things.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q1,Mark Mason,"Again, we're consistent with guidance.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q1,Mark Mason,We believe we're on track for the guidance we gave for the full year of mid-single digits.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q1,Mark Mason,And we're looking forward to generating the efficiencies that come out of this spend and put a dent in our structural expense base over time.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q1,Jane Fraser,Yeah.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q1,Jane Fraser,"And let me jump in as well, Mike, because this is something Mark and I have – we're very, very aware of.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q1,Jane Fraser,We're managing it in excruciating detail on multiple dimensions.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q1,Jane Fraser,We are taking the lessons that we've got to take some of the short-term pain here in order to get us into the position we need to be in the medium term and the long term.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q1,Jane Fraser,And from the stranded costs and the divestitures we know we'll have opportunities there.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q1,Jane Fraser,We talked about at Investor Day also being in a position to simplify the management structure and take out some of the structural expenses there.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q1,Jane Fraser,So this is going to be an area of continued focus for Mark and I.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q1,Jane Fraser,"But we'll make sure that not only are we managing the arc and ensuring there is one, but also that we generate the benefits from our shareholders from all of this.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q1,Jane Fraser,"And it's something I feel exceedingly high accountability for, as does the management team.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q1,Jane Fraser,We get it.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,

2023,Q1,"Question Andanswer
Operator",Ourfirst question will come from Glenn Schorr with Evercore.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,"Question Andanswer
Operator",Your line is now open.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Glenn Schorr,"Hi, thank you, a simple one.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Glenn Schorr,"I appreciate the many, many moving parts, but your first quarter NII and revenue production was great, and if you just annualize it, you're handily ahead of your full year guide.",revenue,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Glenn Schorr,So I'm just curious on how you're thinking about maintaining the guide but running ahead of schedule.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Mark Mason,"Yeah, thanks, Glenn, and good morning.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Mark Mason,Appreciate the question.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Mark Mason,"Look, we did have a very solid first quarter, but as Jane mentioned in her prepared remarks, there are a number of things that are still out there in the global macro environment that are uncertain and unclear, including, frankly, as we contemplate the direction of rates and what's required to tame inflation, let alone the uncertainty that we've seen in parts of the sector here through the quarter.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Mark Mason,"And so when I think about that and I think about how frankly betas have evolved and the likelihood of a recession in the back half of the year, which we have built into our outlook, I remain comfortable with the guidance that we've set here.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Mark Mason,"And when you think about where that comes from, the strength in TTS, the strength in Securities Services, both benefiting from the rate hikes we saw last year, but also deepening relationships with new and existing clients, the Card momentum, which is really about seeing more revolving activity as payment rates start to slow, and the recovery in Investment Banking and Wealth is not as swift as we would like and so we have to see how that plays out too.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Mark Mason,"So when I put those things together, there's certainly some puts and takes that speaks to the diversification of our business model, but it leaves me in a place where I'm comfortable with the guidance that we've set, and if that changes, we'll certainly update you, but that's where we are.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Glenn Schorr,I appreciate that.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Glenn Schorr,"Maybe if I could follow-up on your comments,the previous ones on TTS and Securities Services.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Glenn Schorr,"I try to learn from all my mistakes, I make a lot of them, but in 2008 we thought housing prices couldn't go down much, and then they went down a lot, and we all adapt.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Glenn Schorr,"The same thing in March, thought deposits couldn't leave a bank so quickly, but they did.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Glenn Schorr,"So, slide 25 and 26 people should look at because they're great and they show the stability of your deposit franchise, but I'm curious if history can change at all.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Glenn Schorr,"Meaning right now, those are cash and operating deposits that clients keep with you and they need you, and you're fully integrated, but do you have client concentrations we should know about or are you thinking about any big changes that can happen in terms of client behavior relative to the past in terms of what they keep at any given bank?",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Glenn Schorr,I know it's a tough one.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Jane Fraser,"Glenn, I'll kick it off and pass it over to Mark.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Jane Fraser,"I feel very comfortable about how very well diversified our deposit base is across different countries, industries, clients, and currencies.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Jane Fraser,"It's extremely strong in that respect, and as you say, the majority of the Institutional deposits are integrated into the operating accounts all around the world to enable the clients to run their day-to-day operations, the payroll, the working capital, the supplier financing, et cetera.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Jane Fraser,"And I think what's changed in the more digital world is frankly these have become even stickier because the amount of data, the extent of integration into the technology platforms and systems of the clients and the value that we extract and present back to the clients from the combination of our FX trade, cash, et cetera, flows, is incredibly important in driving their efficiency, their risk management, and their financial performance as well.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Jane Fraser,"So both the extent of that diversification and the increasing stickiness versus history is something that we're certainly not complacent about, but I think is why you see from the pages we've put into the deck as well including in the back on just the consistency of this base.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Jane Fraser,"Mark, what would you add?",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Mark Mason,"I think that's exactly right, Jane, and Glenn, I'm glad you pointed out pages 25 and 26 which clearly lay out that diversification but also the scale and stability of those deposits over an extended period of time.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Mark Mason,The only thing I'd add additional to that would be obviously we're in an environment where there's quantitative tightening that's occurring.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Mark Mason,"That's going to have a broad industry impact as we've started to see already, but we're also in an environment where rates are increasing.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Mark Mason,We'll see how that plays out through the balance of the year.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Mark Mason,"That has an impact on betas, but we shouldn't mistake price-sensitivity or interest rate sensitivity with the stickiness of the deposits.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Mark Mason,"And so we've obviously talked about betas increasing particularly in our TTS portfolio, more so in the US.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Mark Mason,"It obviously will continue to increase outside of the US, but we'll work the relationship that we have with those clients and the breadth of services that we bring to influence and impact pricing, and more importantly, because of the operating nature of them, we do see them as very stable.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Operator,Our next question will come from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Operator,Your line is open.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Operator,Can you talk about for the fee growth?,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Operator,"I mean, we kind of understand the NII growth, but the fee growth is double-digits also, so I guess that's money in motion and I think you described this as the world's largest wholesale global payments system.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Operator,What's happening to give you double-digit top line growth there?,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Jane Fraser,"Oh, thank you, Mike, and a great question.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Jane Fraser,"I think one of the numbers I'm almost more happy about than the stellar revenue growth was the fee growth quarter-over-quarter here because obviously, we've been benefiting in TTS from the rates environment but we've also been benefiting from the drivers behind the franchise.",revenue,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Jane Fraser,"And the fee revenues are coming from multiple different products and different offerings that we have here, and we're typically looking and have consistently looked at growing our fee revenue as a percentage of the underlying growth in TTS.",revenue,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Jane Fraser,"It got masked a bit when the rates environment was growing so much, but the different areas there around the world are making a big difference to the strength of our earnings and the quality of our earnings in these areas.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Mike Mayo,"And then as it relates to rates generally, what is it, like, over 90% of your rate sensitivity is outside the US, and so shouldn't you be benefiting more than you originally thought given some of these rate hikes?",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Mike Mayo,"And I guess, Mark, are you just sandbagging a little bit?",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Mike Mayo,"I get the uncertainties and the IB backlog pushed out, and, no I mean, we want you to have a reasonable bar to jump over and I'm just wondering if you set the bar high enough for yourself for this year.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Mark Mason,"Yeah, so again, I think that there is certainly more opportunity in terms of how rates move and capturing NII as you pointed out outside of the US.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Mark Mason,We articulate our interest rate exposure for a parallel shift and that mix at the end of last year was the 90/10 that you mentioned for non-US.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Mark Mason,"As I sit here in March, it probably is going to skew a little bit less non-US and a little bit more towards the US, and you'll see that in the 10-Q.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Mark Mason,"With that said, I mentioned earlier, there's still a bit of uncertainty in terms of how rates continue to evolve here in the US.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Mark Mason,We'll see how betas evolve.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Mark Mason,"We've reached terminal betas in the US with our clients kind of at the end of last year, and so we'll see kind of what happens in terms of pricing through the balance of 2023.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Mark Mason,"Betas are not quite at terminal levels outside of the US, and so we'll see the pacing of that, again, in light of how the interest rate curve may be evolving and frankly in light of how we've seen the broader sector turmoil play out.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Mark Mason,That could in fact play to our benefit.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Mark Mason,"But we are also, again, in an environment where there's quantitative tightening that is still at play.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Mark Mason,"And then the final point I'd make, Mike, that often people forget is that in that NII is Legacy NII, and so as we continue with our wind-downs, our divestitures, et cetera, that's going to be a headwind that we will have to deal with.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Operator,Our next question will come from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Operator,Your line is open.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Betsy Graseck,"I know during the prepared remarks you talked a bit about Andy Sieg coming on board, and I just wanted to understand how to think about the outlook for what you're doing with Wealth, not only in the US but the non-US locations, and also try to understand how much capital you think you could apply to that business relative to what you have today.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Jane Fraser,Hey there Betsy.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Jane Fraser,"So, we're obviously delighted that Andy is joining as our new Global Head of Wealth around my table, and he's a tremendous leader with a great track record driving growth.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Jane Fraser,He's got deep product and digital expertise; a proven people leader and we'll certainly be taking full advantage of his expertise and experience in the US.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Jane Fraser,We're not shifting our strategy in Wealth.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Jane Fraser,His mandate is consistent with the strategy we laid out at Investor Day.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Jane Fraser,We see a lot of potential of growth in Asia as we fill in the coverage across the full wealth spectrum there.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Jane Fraser,We'll be scaling up in the US by building out the investment offering and cross-selling into our existing and new clients across the country.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Jane Fraser,"We see tremendous potential of growth in our Private Bank and the family office franchise really around the world, and there's a lot of synergies to be realized as we point out in the different KPIs and drivers between the other four core businesses in terms of referrals and other business that we're able to generate across the franchise.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Jane Fraser,So the core of the strategy will not be changing with him coming on board.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Jane Fraser,"Mark, what else would you add in?",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Mark Mason,"The only thing I'd add is that, we are, I think, well-positioned for as the market recovers and it plays towards Wealth.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Mark Mason,"When you look at kind of the client advisors, as you know, we've been investing in bringing on new client advisors.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Mark Mason,We've been increasing the number of new clients that we've been onboarding as well.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Mark Mason,"We've invested in some of the investment products that we have, and so I feel like we are positioning ourselves for when this turns.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Mark Mason,"And as it relates to your question regarding capital, this in a normal cycle is a very healthy returning business, and as the market turns and as we recover, we would look to deploy capital appropriate with the growth and return prospects that we see in front of us.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Mark Mason,"It's also not as much of a capital-intensive business as other businesses, and so I think you've got to keep both of those things in mind.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Operator,Our next question will come from Erika Najarian with UBS.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Operator,Your line is open.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Erika Najarian,"And I think it's remarkable that your first two questions were essentially saying that your revenues are too conservative, so that's very notable for a Citi call.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Erika Najarian,My first question is a follow-up to Betsy.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Erika Najarian,"I think everybody were certainly impressed, Jane, at the Andy Sieg hire, and clearly, he was running a much larger business than what Citi has today.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Erika Najarian,And this is sort of a tricky question.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Erika Najarian,"Clearly, you're still working through some of the transformation.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Erika Najarian,"There's still a consent order, but given your strength as a global player, could Citi participate in perhaps inorganic opportunities that could be out there, having a result perhaps of the liquidity crisis that we saw that could potentially enhance your Wealth Management footprint more quickly?",liquidity,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Jane Fraser,"We see plenty of potential for organic growth potential, and I think that's really where we're going to be focusing, Erika, because I look at the Private Bank and the family office, there is so much wealth creation supplemented by our Commercial Banking relationships with a lot of the enterprises and the owners of those enterprises who are really generating the new industry champions in country after country, and we're extremely well-positioned to capture that.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Jane Fraser,I don't see an inorganic play that would actually help us on it.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Jane Fraser,We also benefit because we don't have our own proprietary products and a sales force pushing those proprietary products.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Jane Fraser,"We're an open architecture, and therefore, we're a very desirable partner for many of our key partners on the Institutional side of the business to be able to provide very interesting value propositions, investment opportunities and the like to our clients around the world.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Jane Fraser,"And finally, we can see certainly areas in interesting digital plays, different partnerships, areas like that that are of interest.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Jane Fraser,So I'll never say never in the longer-run.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Jane Fraser,"I'm sure if something very attractive comes up, we'll be very interested and looking at it, but it's not something right now that I think makes sense, given where we're focused.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Jane Fraser,"Actually almost independent of the consent orders, I think what we're looking at doing right now is getting this organic play right and then we'll see from there.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Mark Mason,"00 referralsfrom our Retail Bank to the Wealth space or to our Wealth business, and there's a lot of embedded opportunity and it really speaks to the integrated model that we've been talking about.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Jane Fraser,"And I think the other bit I'd also just point to is I think one of the things we do benefit from is that we aren't constrained by being dominated by a brokerage model in a particular way of doing Wealth, so part of the mandate for Andy and the ones that we've been working on to date is really looking at what is modern Wealth Management and making sure that we are really well-positioned that way, because I do think that will be more of the way of the future.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Operator,Our next question will come from Jim Mitchell with Seaport Global.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,

2023,Q1,Jim Mitchell,"Appreciate the fact that the potential sale of the Mexico franchise would be a negative impact, but you're sitting at a pretty comfortable cushion now above your target.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Jim Mitchell,"Obviously your expected future retained earnings growth should be more than an offset, so how do we think about, how are you thinking about the timing of restarting buybacks with your stock as cheap as it is?",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Mark Mason,"Yeah, thanks, Jim, and good morning.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Mark Mason,"As you point out, we grew capital pretty sizably this quarter, up to 13.4% from a CET1 ratio point of view and up significantly from a year ago, some 200 basis points or so.",cet1,yes,Yes,cet1,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,Yes,cet1 ratio
2023,Q1,Mark Mason,"And a good portion of that, a significant portion of that, was really net income earnings generation, which is important.",net income,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Mark Mason,"Look, the way we think about it is that 13.4%, we certainly have well-above what's required from a regulatory point of view and it includes our internal management buffer of about 100 basis points.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Mark Mason,"But as we've said in the past, there is certainly the Mexico transaction and that would be a temporary drag to CET1 at signing, the difference between signing and closing if it were a sale to take place.",cet1,yes,Yes,cet1,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Mark Mason,And then there are a couple of other factors that are out there as well.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Mark Mason,So think about the Basel III end game that's out there and the capital requirements that could come out of that.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,Yes,basel iii,No,
2023,Q1,Mark Mason,"Think about the CCAR DFAST that has been submitted and currently under review, and what that might mean for stress capital buffers, and also think about just where we are in the broader economy and broader global macro environment that we're playing in and needing to see how that kind of evolves.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,Yes,"ccar, dfast",No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Mark Mason,"And so when I think about all of those factors, we're in a place where we will continue to take it quarter-by-quarter, but I'd end by saying our bias is kind of where yours is, which is given where we're trading, all things being equal, we'd like to be buying back shares, but we have to be responsible about that and the timing of that.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Jane Fraser,"I think we'll have more clarity fairly soon around a number of the factors, so we'll be able to give you better clarity on timing before too long.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Jim Mitchell,"Yeah, all fair.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Jim Mitchell,"And then maybe as a follow-up, just, you mentioned increased macro assumptions embedded in reserves.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Jim Mitchell,Where are you now on the macro assumptions in the reserve book?,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Markmason,"So in terms of the reserve, again, remember we have a couple of different scenarios that we run when we calculate the CECL reserves.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Markmason,Our current reserves are based on those three macroeconomic scenarios.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Markmason,"It reflects a 5.1% or so unemployment rate on a weighted basis over eight quarters, so that's relatively flat versus last quarter.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Markmason,"The other point worth mentioning is that in this particular calculation for the quarter, we did skew a little bit more towards the downside in terms of the probability weighting than last quarter, in light of the macro environment and the combination of that as well as some normalization in the portfolio including an increase in revolver activity contributed to the increase in reserves we saw.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Markmason,"But to answer your question, unemployment at about 5.1% for the weighted basis over the eight quarters.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Operator,Our next question will come from Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Operator,Your line is open.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Steven Chubak,"Hey, good morning.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Steven Chubak,So I wanted to start off with a question just on the IB and trading outlook.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Steven Chubak,"On the trading side, just given some of the recent macro shocks, have you seen any evidence of bad volatility and are you still confident that you can sustain that mid-single-digit growth target?",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Steven Chubak,"And just on the Investment Banking side, I wanted to see if there's any evidence of green shoots.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Steven Chubak,"It's been a challenging backdrop, as you noted, Mark, but I was hoping you could offer some color just across some of the different product lines, across M&A, ECM, DCM.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Mark Mason,"Why don't I start, and then, Jane, feel free to jump in.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Mark Mason,"Look, we saw better performance in the quarter in Markets than when I talked at the conference earlier in the quarter.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Mark Mason,And really that played through in our Fixed Income business which was up about 4% year-over-year driven largely by strength in Rates and we saw rate volatility in the back end of the quarter and we were well-positioned to take advantage of that and serve clients and that aided getting us to down 4% in aggregate across Markets.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Mark Mason,"What we talked about for the full year is kind of relatively flat performance, and I still think that based on what we see today and subject to how the macro continues to evolve that we'll be able to deliver on that.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Mark Mason,"But as you know, volatility in many instances plays to the favor of Markets businesses, and so there's a bit of an unknown as to how that evolves.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Mark Mason,But I feel confident in the guidance that we've given thus far on that.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Jane Fraser,"Yeah, I'd jump in before you turn to Banking as well.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Jane Fraser,"I think one of the differences with our franchise compared to some others is that we are the go-to bank for corporates, and that provides a highly attractive but pretty steady flow of activity.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Jane Fraser,"This is obviously in the volatile markets we've been seeing is from our perspective very good volatility because we're able to support our clients in rates, FX, commodity hedging, and it makes our risk flows much more diversified than our competitors particularly in volatile markets like this.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Jane Fraser,We're not taking positions.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Jane Fraser,This is really attractive client flow business right at the heart of the global network.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Jane Fraser,"The other piece that I think is important in the mix here too is just the partnership with TTS, cross-border payments, these other elements and cornerstone of the FX franchise, so there's some pieces here of the volatility that one doesn't usually think of this as being so client-heavy, but that's what's differentiating on the Citi franchise.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Jane Fraser,"Mark, back to you.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Mark Mason,"No, thank you, I think that's exactly right in terms of the corporate client base there.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Mark Mason,"Look, in Investment Banking, obviously the wallets were down meaningfully last year.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Mark Mason,"We saw some good performance in debt capital markets this quarter, up 66% versus the prior quarter, particularly as we saw activity in the investment grade names, which is an area of strength for us for sure, and I think there was a bit of momentum behind a bit more clarity on the direction of rates, and so we'll see how that continues to evolve and play out.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Mark Mason,"The other thing I'd add is that we continue to have very good dialogue with clients as they manage through the environment and try to anticipate what the balance of the year looks like, and at some point, it's clear that clients are going to need to get back into the markets, but that trajectory is going to largely depend on the geopolitical and macro environment and how we all manage and navigate that uncertainty.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Mark Mason,"So very engaged, healthy pipeline, but subject to how the environment continues to evolve.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Steven Chubak,That's great.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Steven Chubak,"And for my follow-up, just on PBWM fee income trends, I'm not going to ask you about the broader Wealth strategy, but we're big fans of Andy here, so congrats on the hire.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Steven Chubak,"The one thing I did want to get a better sense of is how much of the sequential improvement that we saw in fees is a function of just partner payments being higher as credit continues to normalize, and how we should be thinking about the trajectory in fees within PBWM over the remainder of this year?",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Mark Mason,"I think there are a couple of things to kind of keep in mind in terms of PBWM fees, and I think part of it is that PBWM is a combination of both the Cards business as well as the Wealth business, and a good amount of the pressure that we've seen in fees and that is still subject to how the environment evolves is in the Wealth space, because we continue to see fee pressure on investment activity and revenues there, and we'll have to see how the market valuations move on some of the assets that we manage on behalf of clients and what momentum it drives in terms of more investment activity.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Mark Mason,So I think that's a big part of the drag in fees.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Mark Mason,"The upside that we've seen in fees in Banking and Cards, again, I think will be subject to how activity and volume evolves across our Cards business.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Mark Mason,"We do expect revolving levels to continue, but purchase sales while they're up year-over-year, when we look at kind of the latter months of the quarter, the growth has been slowing, and has been quite concentrated in travel and entertainment.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Mark Mason,"So we'll have to see how some of that volume activity evolves, and that'll be a factor to keep in mind.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Operator,Our next question will come from Ebrahim Poonawala from Bank of America.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Operator,Your line is open.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Ebrahim Poonawala,"Hey, good afternoon.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Ebrahim Poonawala,Just a couple of quick questions.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Ebrahim Poonawala,"One, in terms of the Banamex sale, I think, Jane, you mentioned that maybe we might hear something relatively soon and you still are pursuing the dual track process.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Ebrahim Poonawala,"One, if you do decide to go the IPO route, does that change the accounting dynamics, Mark, with regards to taking that hit early on if given just the time it might take to go through an IPO.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Ebrahim Poonawala,"And the outlook for the Mexican economy, the banks continue to be robust.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Ebrahim Poonawala,Is that impacting or influencing how you're thinking about the value that you should get from this transaction?,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Jane Fraser,"So, we're in a very active dialogue right now in Mexico, so neither Mark nor I are going to comment in a lot of detail there.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Jane Fraser,"As you say, we're continuing to pursue a dual path, both a sale and an IPO, so we'll have an exit strategy either way, and we'll take the path that is in the best interest of our shareholders.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Jane Fraser,So we've got an enormous body of work going on in Mexico to separate out the Institutional business.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Jane Fraser,I'm pleased with the progress they're making.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Jane Fraser,"I think we're seeing, when we look at the performance of our Mexican franchise, a lot of the really strong performance is happening in our ICG business where Mexico is such a beneficiary of the supply chain dynamics that are happening around the world, and its location is obviously very beneficial given the proximity to the US as well.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Jane Fraser,So I think a lot of the dynamic and the big benefits here coming in the institutional franchise that we're keeping within Citi as a core part of our business.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Jane Fraser,So the current Mexican economy doesn't really have so much of an impact on our current decision-making.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Jane Fraser,The principle is we will take the path that is in the best interest of our shareholders.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Mark Mason,"Yeah, and just to put some numbers to that, for the quarter, Mexico was up 16% revenue year-over-year.",revenue,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Mark Mason,"Quarter-over-quarter up 5%, cards growth, deposit growth, so performing well I would say.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Mark Mason,"And in terms of the latter part of your question, Jane's exactly right.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Mark Mason,"Everything we're doing is positioning us for both a private sale and/or an IPO, and we'll choose the path that's best for shareholders.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Mark Mason,An IPO would take longer.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Mark Mason,"It would likely take longer as we would want a set of full audited financials, et cetera.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Mark Mason,"I would say that in terms of what the implications would be from an accounting point of view, CTA accounting is different for an IPO so we would not recognize that CTA through the P&L in an IPO.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Mark Mason,We wouldn't have at signing that impact that is different from that closing and so that would not be an issue.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Mark Mason,"The impact would be a matter of how much we IPO-ed at that time, so a lot of moving pieces there.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Mark Mason,"We would need to figure out if we ended up down that path, but hopefully that gives you some sense of the scenarios there.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Mark Mason,"But I'd end with just one final point that Jane has made already, which is that the outcome that we choose will be the best outcome for our shareholders, our clients, and employees.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Jane Fraser,And that will be an exit.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Operator,Our next question will come from Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Operator,Your line is open.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Operator,:Hello.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Operator,"You guys have talked about bending the curve on costs I think in the latter part of 2024, and I wanted to see if that's still the case.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Operator,And I guess maybe just some clarification on what bending the curve means.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Operator,"Is that slowing expense growth, absolute drop, any kind of clarity on that, and costs in general kind of medium-term would be helpful.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Mark Mason,"Thank, Matt.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Mark Mason,"To answer your question very directly, yes, it is still the case.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Mark Mason,"We are going to bend the curve, as I mentioned, towards the end of 2024.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Mark Mason,It does mean an absolute dollar reduction in expenses.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Mark Mason,That's helpful.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Mark Mason,"And then, I think in the past you've kind of insinuated that's like the start of hopefully a more material drop in costs beyond, obviously this is far away, but just any additional color there too.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Mark Mason,"Yeah, look, again, look, the expense base is a key area of focus for us, right?",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Mark Mason,We recognize that expenses have been growing.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Mark Mason,"They've been growing because we've been investing in the franchise both transformation-wise as well as business-led growth to support the competitive advantages that we have in many of our franchises, but we're managing that very actively and very deliberately, and that means that we're looking to ensure that we're spending the money in the right way in the right places and that we're going to yield the benefits that we expect from that over time.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Mark Mason,"And that was all factored into the targets that we set at our Investor Day for the medium-term, and what that requires is that we start bending the curve in 2024 as I stated and that we end in that medium-term at a place where we have an operating efficiency of about 60% and we're positioned to have returns that are in that 11% to 12% RoTCE point of view.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Mark Mason,There are a couple of factors that are going to contribute to lowering that expense base.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Mark Mason,"One, the divestitures that we've been talking about, right.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Mark Mason,The second is the benefits from the transformation and other investments that I've just referenced.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Mark Mason,And the third is further organizational and management simplification efforts that we have underway that are enabled by the idea that we're exiting 14 consumer countries.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Mark Mason,"And so those three factors, if you will, become very important to ensure that we get to that lower cost structure and that we're able to deliver on the broader commitments that we're making with regards to returns.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Operator,Thank you.Our next question will come from Gerard Cassidy with RBC Capital Markets.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Operator,Your line is open.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Gerard Cassidy,A couple questions.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Gerard Cassidy,"Jane, maybe starting with you first, or Mark, both of you can answer it.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Gerard Cassidy,"In view of what the disruptions we've seen in the banking system in the month of March with what went on with the regional banks here in the US and obviously the large investment bank over in Switzerland, do you guys see changes coming, or what changes do you see coming in terms of regulatory whether it's more capital, more liquidity, and it may not be directed at a company like yours because you're a global SIFI already and it might be more regionally orientated in the United States.",liquidity,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,Yes,sifi,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Gerard Cassidy,"And as part of this question, Jane, can you guys give us some color on the deposit you and your peers made into First Republic?",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Gerard Cassidy,What was the thinking behind that as well?,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Jane Fraser,"Thank you for the question, Gerard.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Jane Fraser,"Well, I'd say that we hope that there will be a thoughtful and targeted approach to any changes in the regulatory and capital framework and that they address the root causes of what actually happened here, and what happened is a combination of macro impacts from the sharp, rapid rate increases and some idiosyncratic situations, namely a lack of proper asset and liability management at a small handful of banks.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Jane Fraser,"We don't see these issues as pervasive throughout the broader banking industry, but the events certainly highlight the importance of prudent asset and liability management.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Jane Fraser,"We still believe that there is plenty of capital amongst the large banks, and if capital requirements were to increase for the large banks by the regulators it would exacerbate any credit tightening that might go on.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Jane Fraser,"And related to that, what continues to keep me most awake at night is the quantity and quality of activity in the shadow banking industry.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Jane Fraser,"It does not benefit from the same regulatory frameworks and protections for participants, and I, amongst others, fear that more activity getting driven into it, if the banking capital requirements increase, will be to the detriment of system strength and stability.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Jane Fraser,So we hope that this approach will be thoughtful and targeted to where the issues actually were.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Jane Fraser,"As I said in my opening comments, we thought that the regulators both at the local and national and the international level were swift and effective in making sure that they tackled the issues that were in front and we were absolutely delighted that the large banks acted as a source of strength.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Jane Fraser,And let's just step back for a minute.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Jane Fraser,"In the face of tremendous market uncertainty, 11 of the largest US banks were able to come together to inject $30 billion of deposits into First Republic in a little over one day, and that speaks volumes for our capital and balance sheet positions, and I think the responsibility of large institutions in recognizing that we also play an important role here in helping stabilize situations like this.",billion,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Jane Fraser,We thought it was very important to help buy some time and also demonstrate our confidence in the overall US banking system.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Jane Fraser,"So, I hope that gives you a bit of a flavor.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Gerard Cassidy,Very good.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Gerard Cassidy,"And then as a follow-up question, I noticed in your Card, I think it was slide 8, you give us the prime, 80% of the portfolio is prime, which is FICO scores greater than 680.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Gerard Cassidy,"I don't know if you would agree with this statement, but we're hearing that there was some FICO score inflation as a result of the pandemic.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Gerard Cassidy,"A lot of consumers saw their FICO scores go up, and I've seen numbers as high as 70 points, that may be on the high side, but can you guys, do you agree with that, and if you do, would you then expect the 700 FICO score customer at some point to behave like a 650 score customer?",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Jane Fraser,"I think the short answer is no, but let me let Mark answer that one.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Mark Mason,"I think what's really important here, Gerard, is kind of what we're seeing in the way of the performance of the portfolio.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Mark Mason,"So again, I've heard that sentiment regarding FICO score inflation.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Mark Mason,We feel very confident in how we've assessed our customers and what it means to have 80% of our customers prime and greater than 680.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Mark Mason,"I think importantly, what we're seeing is we're seeing payment rates start to slow.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Mark Mason,We're seeing average interest-earning balances start to increase.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Mark Mason,"We're seeing NCL rates increase, but particularly driven by the lower FICO score customers across the portfolio which is where you would expect to start to see that drag occur, and the NCL rates that we're seeing are still well below what we would see in a normal cycle and they're in line with what we've been forecasting for performance.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Mark Mason,So there are no surprises that we're seeing in terms of how that curve is evolving.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Mark Mason,We'd expect that it will get back to those normal levels towards the beginning of next year.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Mark Mason,It will likely play through those normal levels a bit before tapering.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Mark Mason,"But my point here is that we understand our customers, the portfolio, and how it reacts to the environment enough to forecast that out, and so far, that's been performing in line with that forecast and those estimates.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Mark Mason,"And importantly, we continue to stress it to make sure we're not missing anything and importantly, we carry a sizable reserve, as you know, as part of that $20 billion.",billion,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Jane Fraser,I'd also add that we don't just rely on FICO scores for assessing the credit of our customers and our portfolio.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Jane Fraser,"There's a tremendous amount of data that we draw upon that goes well, well beyond that, and that's also, as you can imagine, something that gives a lot more confidence is it's not just prior history, it's a wealth of data that is used.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Operator,Our next question will come from Vivek Juneja with JPMorgan.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,

2023,Q1,Vivek Juneja,"What is in your revenue assumption, just want to unpeel that onion a little bit.",revenue,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Vivek Juneja,"What's in your revenue assumption for rates, US and internationally, and what is going on with deposit betas particularly following the inflows you've seen recently in the US with the crisis?",revenue,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Vivek Juneja,The second point I'd make is around non-US rates.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Vivek Juneja,"We're assuming, I don't have specifics in front of me in terms of the rate curves around the globe, but we are assuming continued rate increases there.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Vivek Juneja,"Not of a significant magnitude, but some assumptions there depending on where we're talking about.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Vivek Juneja,"The beta assumptions that we have built in are for betas to continue to increase outside of the US, but again, they run lower than the US in general for our multinational clients.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Vivek Juneja,"We expect that we will see in the PBWM Retail Banking, or the PBWM client segment space that clients are likely to move towards either higher-yielding deposit products or investment products, and so we've factored those things into how we think about the outlook.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Vivek Juneja,And could that change or evolve?,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Vivek Juneja,Absolutely.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Vivek Juneja,But that's kind of what's behind what we've assumed here.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Vivek Juneja,"And just as a clarification, with the inflows you've seen recently in deposits with the crisis, this is in the US, obviously, are the betas tempering a little bit, how much those are going up?",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Vivek Juneja,"Is that slowing down, or not any change so far?",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Mark Mason,So a couple things I mentioned.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Mark Mason,"So one, we did see inflows in the quarter associated with some of the sector turmoil.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Mark Mason,"We've looked at kind of deposit levels from call it March 7th, March 8th through close to the end of March, and we certainly did see an uptick, call it probably a little bit under $30 billion or so of inflows in that period of time, with a good portion of that in our CCB, our Commercial Middle-Market client base.",billion,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Mark Mason,"It's too soon to tell kind of how betas evolve, but we do think that a good portion of those deposits will likely be sticky.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Mark Mason,"I think what's important here is that part of our strategy here is in fact growing operating deposits with our large multinational clients and our middle-market clients, and so we're going to continue to be focused on that.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Mark Mason,"What's a little bit unclear is how the rate environment continues to evolve and what that means for how betas actually evolve, and we'll have to kind of wait and see.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Mark Mason,It's too soon to tell as it relates to that.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Operator,Our next question will come from Ken Usdin with Jefferies.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Operator,Your line is open.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Ken Usdin,"Hey, Mark, just a follow-up on the credit.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Ken Usdin,"So you mentioned obviously that you moved your part of your CECL adjustment a little bit in your weightings, and you had previously talked about getting towards normalized card losses, I think you'd said by around the end of the year.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Ken Usdin,"So can you just given the changes that we're seeing ahead of us and definitely saw some normalization happen this quarter, can you just, are you still on line for that getting to that 3-3.5% and 5-5.5% in the respective card businesses by around year-end this year?",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Mark Mason,"Yeah, year-end, early next year, yes.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Mark Mason,"We're still kind of on track, on trend for that.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Mark Mason,"Again, I'd expect that they pick up a little bit after that before they start tapering down.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Mark Mason,"But the answer to your question, Ken, is yes.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Mark Mason,"That's still the timeline, fourth quarter, early 2024 reaching those normalized levels.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Ken Usdin,And then one more just follow-up.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Ken Usdin,"End-of-period deposits down 3%, you mentioned the taxes.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Ken Usdin,"Are the taxes, is the tax impact felt across the business?",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Ken Usdin,"When I look at the deposits page, there are a lot of ins and there are a lot of outs on an end-of-period basis, and just trying to get a sense of like what areas might have been impacted by that tax seasonality and where there was just some of the other pieces that you've already talked through in terms of inflows, outflows, and everything else in between.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Mark Mason,"Yeah, it's a good question.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Mark Mason,"So, again, when you look at our deposits on an average basis, you see on page 26 that they tick up a little bit.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Mark Mason,"If you look at it on an end of period basis, they're down about 3%, and essentially, intra-quarter, particularly in March as I mentioned earlier, we did see a sizable increase in flows.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Mark Mason,"With that said, if you remember in the fourth quarter, we saw a nice run-up in deposits, and then we have the seasonality point that I referenced in my prepared remarks where we have both operational payments from our large TTS clients as well as tax payments with our TTS clients, also with Wealth clients to some extent kind of playing through the end-of-period deposits.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Mark Mason,"And again, that for the most part is normal operating payments that we'd expect to see at this time of year.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Jane Fraser,So no surprises in what happened.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Operator,Our last question will come from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Operator,Your line is open.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Mike Mayo,Just one clarification on that last answer.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Mike Mayo,You said you had intra-quarter flows.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Mike Mayo,"Did you gain more deposits in the month of March, and was that in the US?",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Mark Mason,"Yes, that's what I was talking about, Mike, in terms of those flows.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Mark Mason,"They did come largely in the US in the month of March, call it March 8th through kind of the end of March.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Mark Mason,"They were overshadowed by these normal payments that I referenced, and we did, we still see good activity kind of even as we came through March and into early parts of April.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Jane Fraser,And that was both in the Institutional business that we saw the inflows as well as in PBWM.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Mike Mayo,"And if you define deposits this way, I mean, if I'm oversimplifying, correct me, but, look, you have 5,000 multinationals you really target for payments, Capital Markets and Banking.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Mike Mayo,"Those companies have a lot of deposits, a lot of Services.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Mike Mayo,That's the stickiness and that's where you said 80% of your clients in TTS have been with you for over 15 years.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Mike Mayo,"What if the deposits for those 5,000 multinationals, and I know I'm asking you to slice and dice in a little bit different way, but even just a general sense, because the reason I'm asking this is because I think there's a disconnect between showing percent of uninsured deposits as a measure of stickiness, and I don't think that's valid, and you've showed higher deposits even though you have a big percentage of uninsured deposits or maybe that doesn't matter as much as some front pages of newspapers are suggesting, so if you could address that.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Mark Mason,"Yeah, thanks, Mike.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Mark Mason,"Look, I'd tell you to turn to page 26 in the earnings presentation.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Mark Mason,"We've broken down the deposits for each of the businesses that we have, and at the bottom, you see the TTS deposits, and this is where the 5,000 or so large multinational client deposits reside, and you can see the stability, as well as the steady growth in those deposits over time.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Mark Mason,"And to your point, these are largely operational deposits that these clients have with us, and we shouldn't mistake rate sensitivity or betas with stickiness, right, and it's because these deposits tend to be quite sticky with us, as you can see here.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Mark Mason,"Now, they're price-sensitive in the sense that as rates go up, we often have to reprice those.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Mark Mason,"But remember, the relationships we have with these clients are broader than just deposit relationships, and that's what gives us the opportunity to adjust pricing accordingly with our deposits both in the US and outside of the US.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Mark Mason,"And so the other page, in your own time you can look at it is the page prior to that which again speaks to the diversification of the portfolio but it also speaks to the length of time that many of these clients have been with us and have grown with us, and so nearly 80% of our deposits are from clients that have a greater than 15 year relationship with us, and that says a lot.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Mark Mason,"And so anyway, those are the two points I'd make.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Mark Mason,Hopefully that addresses your question around the stickiness.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q1,Jane Fraser,"Yeah, I often say it takes a root canal to extract us from the operations of our clients just because of exactly what we're talking about here, and that's also we see it even with the mid-market clients that are a growing portion here as well because we're helping them expand internationally, and that stickiness comes through and the LCR of 120% is a very high-quality LCR ratio.",,yes,No,,Yes,lcr,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,Yes,lcr
2023,Q1,Operator,And there are no further questions at this time.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,

2024,Q1,Mark Mason,It's a combination of the top line and the expense work playing through the balance of the quarters and the year here.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,

2024,Q1,Jim Mitchell,"So, can you talk a little bit about the flexibility on the expenses?",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q1,Jim Mitchell,You have a range in 2026 of $51 billion to $53 billion.,billion,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q1,Jim Mitchell,"So, if revenues are coming in below the targets, is it, I guess, A, fair to assume you'd be at the very low-end of that range or is and I think there is some revenue growth built in there.",revenue,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q1,Jim Mitchell,"So, is there some flexibility to the downside to try to get to your targets in a tougher revenue environment?",revenue,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,

2024,Q1,Mark Mason,We've already signaled $1.5 billion that's in front of us.,billion,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q1,Mark Mason,"The reality is that if there's softness in revenues, that's why we have a range, obviously, the volume-related expenses would come down with any softness in revenue.",revenue,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q1,Mark Mason,"And depending on the drivers of why that revenue is softening, we'd look at the investments that we're making across the business and make sure that those are appropriately calibrated for where we are in the cycle and what we're seeing on the top line.",revenue,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q1,Mark Mason,"With that said, we've got to continue to invest in the Transformation.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q1,Mark Mason,We're not going to compromise that.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,

2024,Q1,Mark Mason,But that's kind of how the dynamic works.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q1,Mark Mason,"There's a top we've got a mix of businesses that I think we've demonstrated resiliency around if you think about the past couple of years, and we expect for those to continue to drive some top line momentum.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q1,Mark Mason,But we've got levers in case they don't.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,

2024,Q1,Ebrahim Poonawala,Should we expect the pace of buybacks to increase?,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q1,Ebrahim Poonawala,And if you could provide additional color as we think about the rest of the year would be greatly appreciated.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q1,Mark Mason,"Look, you know and I've said it repeatedly, Jane has said it repeatedly, given where we trade, we think buying back is smart and we'd like to do as much as we possibly can and as much as makes sense in light of the uncertainty that's out there.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q1,Mark Mason,We have run at about 13.5% this quarter.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q1,Mark Mason,That does give us capacity above the 13.3%.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q1,Mark Mason,But it's important to keep in mind that there's client demand that will continue to evolve.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,

2024,Q1,Mark Mason,"But we recognize that there's an opportunity there, and we'll get after it just as soon as it makes good sense for us.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q1,Operator,Our next question is from Erika Najarian at UBS.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q1,Operator,Please unmute your line and ask your question.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q1,Erika Najarian,"So, clearly, the theme of this that's emerging on the Q&A is a healthy skepticism about the revenue targets in line with the in light of the expense declines, which is not really us analysts, we're sort of a little bit parroting what we're hearing from long-only investors that haven't yet jumped into the stock.",revenue,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q1,Erika Najarian,"So, to that end, I guess I'm going to ask Ebrahim's question differently, and then ask a question about card late fees.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q1,Erika Najarian,"How are you balancing clearly, your valuation would demand that the buybacks be ramped up from $500 million.",million,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q1,Erika Najarian,But growing revenues at a 4% to 5% CAGR would mean potentially some capital plowed back into the business.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q1,Erika Najarian,"I guess how are you balancing that, especially given that the demand for buyback is louder at Citi than any other money center peer?",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q1,Erika Najarian,And could you give us a sense of what card late fees are and how that would impact the $80 billion to $81 billion for the year if we do get an earlier implementation than October?,billion,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q1,Mark Mason,Yeah.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q1,Mark Mason,"On the first part of the question, I'd just remind you and everyone else that we're playing for the long-term here, right.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q1,Mark Mason,"So, we have set some medium-term targets.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q1,Mark Mason,"Obviously, Jane has recasted the vision and the strategy.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q1,Mark Mason,"I think we're making very good progress against that, but we're playing for the long-term.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q1,Mark Mason,And what that means is that we have to continue to invest in the franchise.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q1,Mark Mason,"It's why I've given you a range around the expenses, at least in part.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q1,Mark Mason,It's why I've continued to stress the importance of protecting the Transformation and risk and control spend.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q1,Mark Mason,"And it's why I started the answer to Ebrahim's question by saying that we want to be sure that we can match the client demand out there, where the returns to do so makes sense.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q1,Mark Mason,"And so, we are having to balance kind of the use of capital and other resources against that longer term strategic objective and utilize it where it makes sense and generates good returns against the idea of returning that to shareholders.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q1,Mark Mason,"And so, we'll continue to do that.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q1,Mark Mason,It's an everyday assessment.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q1,Mark Mason,It's an everyday discussion with the teams.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q1,Mark Mason,"Frankly, it's why things like the revenue sharing has been put in place to intensify the discussion around the clients that we're using balance sheet with and ensuring that we're driving broader revenues across the platform.",revenue,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q1,Mark Mason,"And so, that's kind of how we're operating in terms of making that trade-off on a regular basis, in addition to obviously the broader regulatory environment that we're in.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q1,Mark Mason,"In terms of the second part of your question around late fees, we haven't disclosed kind of the dollar amount of the late fees.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q1,Mark Mason,What I would say is that we did and have factored that into the $80 billion to $81 billion.,billion,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q1,Mark Mason,And the only thing I'd add to that is it did kind of it's being implemented a bit earlier than what we had assumed.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q1,Mark Mason,"But again, it's inside of the range of the guidance that I've given you for top line revenue for the year.",revenue,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q1,Jane Fraser,"s a reminder, 85% of our two card portfolios are prime, and in CRS, where you tend to see some of the lower income households, we do have that the economics of the fee change will be shared with our partners in CRS.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q1,Jane Fraser,"So, we want our customers to pay on time.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q1,Jane Fraser,We have a number of mechanisms to do so.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q1,Jane Fraser,"But in terms of the economics, I think we, along with the rest of the industry, will be putting in mitigating actions over time, some of which we've already begun to implement.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q1,Mark Mason,"Good add, thank you.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,

2024,Q1,John Mcdonald,"Mark, I was hoping you'd give a little more color on how you're feeling about the credit card charge-offs.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q1,John Mcdonald,You maintained the outlook for the year.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q1,John Mcdonald,You mentioned the higher end on Retail Services.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q1,John Mcdonald,Do you still feel like you'll see a peak this year?,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q1,John Mcdonald,And what kind of metrics are you looking at in terms of delinquency formation and seasoning to inform that view that you might see the peak in card charge-offs this year?,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q1,Mark Mason,Yeah.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q1,Mark Mason,We have obviously continued to manage this portfolio very actively.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q1,Mark Mason,We've seen continued top line growth.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q1,Mark Mason,We've seen continued average interest-earning balance growth.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q1,Mark Mason,"We've talked about how we expect for the cost of credit to normalize, and we've seen that continue to happen.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q1,Mark Mason,"The range that we've given on Branded Cards, we're inside of that range.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q1,Mark Mason,"When you look at the spend across the portfolios, the spend is really happening with the affluent customers more so than anything else.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q1,Mark Mason,"And so, we're watching the lower income customer profile or customers that we have.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q1,Mark Mason,"But again, as Jane mentioned, we tend to skew to the higher end to begin with.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q1,Mark Mason,Where we're really seeing the pressure is where I mentioned in terms of Retail Services.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q1,Mark Mason,"And so, there, the current NCLs are higher than the high-end of the full year range that I've given.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q1,Mark Mason,"But if you look back, that is not inconsistent with seasonality that we've seen in the past in that portfolio, where the first two quarters are higher than the back half of the year, in part because of coming out of the holiday season and how losses tend to mature or materialize through that process.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q1,Mark Mason,"And so, I'd expect to not only see them be higher than the average range in Q1, but also in Q2 before coming down.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q1,Mark Mason,"And then, I still expect that in 2025, you tend to see them further normalize and come down a bit off of these ranges.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q1,Mark Mason,"But look, the reality is that we continue to watch it, and the factors that are out there that are important include how unemployment evolves, what happens with inflation, what happens with interest rates, and those will be important factors as to how the loss rates continue to evolve over time.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q1,Mark Mason,I think the final point I'd make and I mentioned it in the prepared remarks is that we have to remember that the loss rates in both portfolios reflect kind of multiple vintages maturing at the same time.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q1,Mark Mason,"And you'll recall, and this is an industry dynamic, through the COVID pandemic period, losses were at an all-time low, payment rates at all-time highs, supported by government stimulus.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q1,Mark Mason,"And now coming out of that, we're seeing the COVID vintages mature, albeit at a lagged pace from what would be normal, and we're seeing the incremental acquisitions that we've done start to mature at their normal pace.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q1,Mark Mason,"And so, these loss rates are exacerbated by that impact and that's an important factor we can't lose sight of.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q1,Mark Mason,But the bottom line is that we're watching it.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q1,Mark Mason,The macro factors matter.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q1,Mark Mason,"We feel good about the quality mix that we have, and we'll kind of see how things evolve from here.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q1,John Mcdonald,"Okay and on the Branded side, you still expect kind of the peak-ish?",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q1,John Mcdonald,"Are you still inside of the range for the full year and expect 2025, you could move lower on the Branded charge-offs?",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q1,Mark Mason,"Yes, I still kind of expect that trend line of peaking and then kind of moving a bit lower in Branded.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q1,Operator,Our next question is from Ken Usdin at Jefferies.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,

2024,Q1,Operator,Please go ahead.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q1,Ken Usdin,Great.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q1,Ken Usdin,"Can I follow up on the card line of thinking and just ask you, Mark, to talk a little bit about just cost of credit?",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q1,Ken Usdin,"We did still see some card related build this quarter even with the comments you just made and seasonal softer loan growth So, just from a bigger picture perspective, how do you think, continue to think about reserve builds from here and how that informs your outlook for cost of credit?",loan growth,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q1,Mark Mason,"Yeah, sure.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q1,Mark Mason,"Look, I think that when I think about the reserve builds, I think it's the same factors that come into play.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q1,Mark Mason,"So, obviously, the view on the macro is important.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q1,Mark Mason,"And right now, if you think about some of the key macro factors that impact the cards portfolio, the unemployment assumptions weighted is about 5%, the downside is about 7% kind of weighted over the period.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q1,Mark Mason,"And so, how that evolves will be an important factor.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q1,Mark Mason,"How HPI evolves would be an important consideration here for this portfolio, but also what happens with volumes becomes a factor on reserve builds and how important or how much they increase or decrease.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q1,Mark Mason,"And then the final piece is mix, and it's kind of related to that revolver point.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q1,Mark Mason,"As we see the mix evolve from transactors to revolvers, that's going to play into how much of a reserve from a lifetime point of view we have to continue to build.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q1,Mark Mason,"And so, it's why I mentioned on John's question the importance of looking at the interest rates, looking at what's happening with inflation, watching the lower income customer base, because all of those things combined with how we think about the scenarios and the weighting will be a factor on the reserves.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q1,Mark Mason,"But I will say, Ken, as I sit here and think about what we have in the quarter, I feel very good about the reserve levels.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q1,Mark Mason,The 8.2% for combined kind of ACL-to-loan ratio feels right for the mix of this portfolio and we'll continue to watch it.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q1,Ken Usdin,And a separate question on TTS.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q1,Ken Usdin,That NII related to TTS has been remarkable with rising rates.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q1,Ken Usdin,"This quarter, granted there was a lesser day and there could be currency stuff in there, the first quarter that it stepped back, I'm just wondering like where is that in its asset liability sensitivity, the TTS NII, and what are your thoughts about that piece of the NII puzzle going forward?",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q1,Mark Mason,"I mean, I think I'd say a couple things.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q1,Mark Mason,We do have kind of some Argentina playing through the NII line.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q1,Mark Mason,I will say that the best way to think about it is kind of the underlying beta activity.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q1,Mark Mason,"And we have seen, this is the corporate client, it is an institutional client.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q1,Mark Mason,"We have seen betas, particularly in the US, at kind of normalized or terminal levels and playing a bit through that.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q1,Mark Mason,We are seeing betas outside of the US continue to increase as it relates to the TTS client base.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q1,Mark Mason,But all of that again is inside of the range that we've talked about.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q1,Mark Mason,"I don't expect to see kind of year-over-year growth on the NII line anywhere close to kind of what we've seen in prior years, prior quarters, just in light of kind of how the rate environment s evolved, and in light of kind of quantitative tightening and the impact on deposit levels.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q1,Mark Mason,"The last point I'd make on this is, we will continue to drive and see growth as it relates to the operating deposits, and that will be an important tailwind that kind of plays through.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q1,Operator,Our next question is from Vivek Juneja at JPMorgan.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,

2024,Q1,Mark Mason,"But the short answer is that if you think about the nature of the business that we do in Argentina, it is a big part of our institutional client relationships.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,

2024,Q1,Scott Siefers,"Mark, I think you touched on at least a component of this a couple questions ago, but maybe just broadly an update on your rate positioning.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q1,Scott Siefers,"I guess I only ask, because it looks like we might be starting to diverge in terms of global rate trajectories, if we potentially go lower in Europe, but higher here for a while.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,

2024,Q1,Mark Mason,"Yeah, let me try and take it in, in two pieces, I guess.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q1,Mark Mason,"So one is, if I think about how the rate implieds have evolved from the 3 to 6 to now something a little bit north of 1 in the context of what I expect for our performance, it doesn't have a material impact on the guidance that I've given of $80 billion to $81 billion.",billion,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q1,Mark Mason,"And in part, that's because as I think about the timing for the planned cuts, which was generally back-loaded, as well as some of the other factors that play through.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,

2024,Q1,Mark Mason,Late fees are actually booked in our NII line.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q1,Mark Mason,"And so, those factors put me in a place where I feel like there will certainly be puts and takes around how that rate curve evolves, and therefore I'm very comfortable kind of leaving the guidance where it is.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q1,Mark Mason,"To answer your broader question, in terms of kind of how we are positioned, I'd point you to the 10-K that we have that's out.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q1,Mark Mason,"And in that 10-K, we offer as we have before a number of IRE scenarios for plus or minus 100 basis points and what it means for our business.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,

2024,Q1,Mark Mason,"So, as rates increase, we should see an increase in our NII performance.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,

2024,Q1,Mark Mason,"But if you look at the breakdown, what the breakdown will show is that for US dollar, at this point we're neutral.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q1,Mark Mason,"So, if rates were to go up, rates were to go down, no material impact as it relates to our revenue.",revenue,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q1,Mark Mason,"For the non-US dollar, we're still quite asset-sensitive, right?",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q1,Mark Mason,"And so, that should give you some sense for and we recognize the limitations with IRE, it assumes 100 basis point parallel shift across the curve to a static balance sheet, etcetera, but that should give you some sense for the implications of the rate curve moves as it relates to our book of business.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,

2024,Q1,Mark Mason,"And part of that again is a by-product of the revenue sharing that we've implemented, where there's been healthy debate and discussion around the names that we want to continue to serve, and whether they're positioned to take advantage of the broader platform that we have.",revenue,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,

2024,Q1,Mark Mason,"And I think we're well-positioned to be thoughtful about that, but Jane, you may want to add a couple points to it.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q1,Jane Fraser,"Yeah, look, around the world, the corporate client base and our Commercial Banking mid market client base have very healthy balance sheets and we're also seeing market access gradually opening up as well, which is also helpful for to the quality issuers across all asset classes.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,

2024,Q1,Jane Fraser,"The other piece I just pop out there as well is the recent large M&A announcements in multiple industries is a sign of rising confidence from CEOs and boards and active discussions are increasing, as supportive capital markets create confidence, as people think about larger strategic transactions.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q1,Jane Fraser,"This is going to feed acquisition finance, bridge financing and some of the higher-margin capital markets and lending activity as well.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q1,Jane Fraser,"So, as we look forward, I think it's recognizing the shift in some of the drivers from company just investing, refinancing, looking at where they can diversify their capital raising in different quarters.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q1,Jane Fraser,But I'd just close by saying I couldn't agree with you more about geopolitical risks and fragility.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,

2024,Q1,Mark Mason,"We have seen growth in the quarter, in operating deposits.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q1,Mark Mason,"The confidence comes from the focus that we've had with our existing clients as well as the growth we've seen with new clients, doing more with existing in more countries, more deeply penetrating the commercial middle-market space, and so we've been very thoughtfully focused on deposits that obviously give us the most value and also, provide the most stickiness as it relates to that relationship and so yes, the confidence is rooted in what we're seeing in the way of underlying operating deposit growth including inside this quarter.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,

2024,Q1,Mark Mason,"I will say that the revolver levels are at least back to where they were pre-pandemic and leave it at that, but we are seeing kind of continued revolver activity which you'd expect kind of given the way the cycle has evolved and given payment rates have started to moderate and the stimulus has kind of unwound, and so all of that is kind of consistent with expectations but obviously, is a factor in reserve levels as I mentioned earlier.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,

2025,Q1,Ebrahim Poonawala,And how we can back into the pace of buybacks.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2025,Q1,Mark Mason,"So, I'd say a couple of things.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2025,Q1,Mark Mason,"So one, last quarter, we announced a $20 billion share repurchase program.",billion,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2025,Q1,Mark Mason,"And we continue to feel good about that program, as you would expect.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,

2025,Q1,Mark Mason,"We're clear on where we're trading, and we're clear that, that is a smart thing to do once we've funded demand from a client point of view across our businesses, that's accretive to returns.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2025,Q1,Mark Mason,"And so, the RWA consumption is tied to that demand that we see.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2025,Q1,Mark Mason,We think we've seen good client demand across the platform that's helped drive the top line momentum that you see in each and every one of our businesses that's helped to drive the improved returns that you see in the quarter in each and every one of our businesses.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2025,Q1,Mark Mason,"And as we see that demand, again, accretive in returns, we'll be looking to meet that as a first priority.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2025,Q1,Mark Mason,We are targeting the 13.1% [CET1 Capital ratio] by the end of the year.,"capital ratio, cet1",yes,Yes,"cet1, capital ratio",No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,

2025,Q1,Mark Mason,That's hard to forecast as you well know.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,

2025,Q1,Ebrahim Poonawala,Understood.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,

2025,Q1,Ebrahim Poonawala,And I'm just trying to get to the pieces around buybacks?,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,

2025,Q1,Mark Mason,Let me take that in a couple of different pieces.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2025,Q1,Mark Mason,"So, the first thing I'd say is that as I look at our credit exposure and I look at the consumer, the consumer continues to be resilient and discerning in their spend.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2025,Q1,Mark Mason,"And in fact, we did see spend hold up in the quarter, and we saw spend actually increase in our Branded Cards portfolio, up about 3%.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,

2025,Q1,Jane Fraser,And April is performing in line with that as well.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2025,Q1,Mark Mason,And April has been consistent that.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2025,Q1,Mark Mason,"As we think about reserves, we ended the quarter at about $23 billion of reserves across the entire business.",billion,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2025,Q1,Mark Mason,That's about a 2.7% reserve-to-loan ratio.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2025,Q1,Mark Mason,"When I look at the drivers of that, as you know, when we establish when we do our [CECL] analysis on a quarterly basis, we have three scenarios that we run.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2025,Q1,Mark Mason,"A host of other stress scenarios, but that inform the [CECL] analysis, there are three scenarios, the base case scenario, there's a downside scenario and there's an upside scenario.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2025,Q1,Mark Mason,"And as we looked at the macroeconomic outlook and key variables that go into those scenarios, we assumed a deterioration in that macro-outlook.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2025,Q1,Mark Mason,And we increased the probability or the weighting towards the downside scenario in light of what we were seeing in the macro environment.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2025,Q1,Mark Mason,"When you look through to some of the of the key variables, or one variables you referenced, unemployment, the average unemployment rate was 5.1% across those three scenarios.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2025,Q1,Mark Mason,"The unemployment rate in the downside scenario, the average was 6.7% across those eight quarters.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2025,Q1,Mark Mason,"And so, we've assumed some pretty meaningful shifts in unemployment, particularly on that downside our analysis.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2025,Q1,Mark Mason,That informed the increase in our ACL reserves that's referenced in the deck.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2025,Q1,Mark Mason,And that increase was offset a bit by the sequential reduction in volumes that is somewhat seasonal.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2025,Q1,Mark Mason,"So hopefully, that helps.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2025,Q1,Mark Mason,"We feel good about those reserves based on what we know and our current view of the macroeconomic environment, and we'll obviously do that on a quarterly basis as things continue to evolve.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2025,Q1,Operator,Our next question comes from the line of John McDonald with Truist Securities.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2025,Q1,Operator,"Your line is now open, please go ahead.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2025,Q1,John Mcdonald,"Hi Mark, I wanted to ask you about capital optimization levers that you have to you've done, made some good progress in RWA mitigation.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2025,Q1,John Mcdonald,Is there still some room to go there.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2025,Q1,John Mcdonald,"And then also, could you maybe increase the pace of DTA utilization to reduce the TCE density in a way to help the RoTCE goal.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2025,Q1,Mark Mason,"So, look, we're always looking at opportunities to further optimize the use of capital.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2025,Q1,Mark Mason,In Markets we've talked about last year a lot about the revenue to RWA as a tool that we've been using there.,revenue,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2025,Q1,Mark Mason,That's continued to increase that metric and ratio.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2025,Q1,Mark Mason,"We continue to look at, are we optimizing balance sheet and getting the broader revenue streams we'd expect from our client base, when we do our corporate lending work and some of that is showing up in how we've now introduced the revenue sharing as a tool to ensure we're capturing broader revenues from clients when we are using balance sheet.",revenue,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2025,Q1,Mark Mason,"So, we're constantly working through this and identifying opportunities to ensure we're getting the highest return on that.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2025,Q1,Mark Mason,"In fact, as you look through the material we provided, you'll see that in light of the improvement we've seen across all of our businesses last year as well as our forecast for growth this year, there, in fact, is a shift in the TCE.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2025,Q1,Mark Mason,"And so,the allocated TCE has gone down for many of these businesses because they have shown good PPNR growth, good profitability.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2025,Q1,Mark Mason,"And so, as we stress test it internally, the stressed losses with the businesses have, in fact, come down.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,Yes,stress test,No,,No,,No,,No,
2025,Q1,Mark Mason,"Now obviously, we have to adhere to the regulator stress test, and so that shifted from the businesses into Corporate/Other, but it is a positive sign as we think about how the stressed capital buffer might evolve and as we exit different parts of the franchise, the underlying segments are already showing that that improvement would suggest lower levels of stressed losses.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,Yes,stress test,No,,No,,No,,No,
2025,Q1,Mark Mason,And so that's another important point that we diligently manage even if we can't control the impact at the top of the house.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2025,Q1,Mark Mason,"Your point around DTA, we continue to focus on bringing the DTA down.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,

2025,Q1,Mark Mason,"We did see a pickup this quarter, which is really just a timing difference pickup.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2025,Q1,Mark Mason,It happens in the first quarter of every year.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2025,Q1,Mark Mason,"It is tied to deferred compensation and loan loss reserves as timing difference DTA and as we earn more income through the balance of the year and obviously create income tax liability, it will utilize that increase we saw or offset that that increase we saw in the first quarter here.",,yes,No,,No,,Yes,loan loss reserves,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2025,Q1,Mark Mason,We are targeting bringing down in 2025 and in 2026 in order to contribute optimizing capital.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2025,Q1,John Mcdonald,I wanted to ask Jane about the Banamex IPO planning.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,

2025,Q1,Jane Fraser,"Look, first of all, we continue to be on track with the preparation for the IPO, John.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2025,Q1,Jane Fraser,I was just down in Mexico last week.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2025,Q1,Jane Fraser,And the team is fully focused on driving Banamex's business performance.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2025,Q1,Jane Fraser,I was very pleased to see improvements and not the underlying drivers of their performance when is down there.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2025,Q1,Jane Fraser,"And they're also focused on getting the work done to be able to go public, things like the prepared audited financial statements or filling the various regulatory requirements.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2025,Q1,Jane Fraser,As we told them we want to see the business performance improving and we want to make sure that we are doing everything in our control to be in a position to IPO by the year-end.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2025,Q1,Jane Fraser,"And to the second part of your question, we will always look at what we believe to be in the best interest of our shareholders.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2025,Q1,Jane Fraser,We believe that the best interest of our shareholders is to be able to IPO this business.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2025,Q1,Jane Fraser,We think that is the right thing.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2025,Q1,Jane Fraser,"It fits with Citi's strategy for all the reasons we've talked about in the past, we're the best owner of the corporate franchise we have there.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2025,Q1,Jane Fraser,We are not the best owner of a domestic bank.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2025,Q1,Jane Fraser,"So, the timing of when we IPO will be driven by market conditions.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2025,Q1,Jane Fraser,It will be driven by the timing of regulatory approvals.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2025,Q1,Jane Fraser,So that could move that from 2025 into 2026.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2025,Q1,Jane Fraser,And we will always be guided by what we think will maximize value for our shareholders.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2025,Q1,Operator,Our next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Autonomous.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2025,Q1,Operator,"Your line is now open, please go ahead.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2025,Q1,Ken Usdin,I wanted to follow up on the points you made about the consumer hanging in there through April.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2025,Q1,Ken Usdin,"And Mark, you mentioned that there could be more uncertainty as we get later.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2025,Q1,Ken Usdin,But I believe you're still intact with your charge-off guides for the year.,charge-off,no,No,,No,,Yes,charge-off,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2025,Q1,Ken Usdin,"I think just noticing Retail Services was, I think, expectedly higher than high end at 6.43%.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2025,Q1,Ken Usdin,Can you just remind us again how you're expecting the cadence of credit card losses to trajected for both Branded Cards and Retail Services as you go forward?,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2025,Q1,Mark Mason,"Again, we do obviously feel that we are well reserved here.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2025,Q1,Mark Mason,We did expect to see a pickup in the first half of the year before trending down in the back half of the year.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2025,Q1,Mark Mason,And so that's kind of the cadence that we'd expect between now and the end of the year.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2025,Q1,Mark Mason,"The first half is usually seasonally higher than the back half of the year, and you see that in Retail Services.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2025,Q1,Mark Mason,"I would also point out that and you can see it in the deck and I think it's the second page of the appendix but also in the supplement, you are starting to see that delinquency buckets, we show the 90-day plus delinquency bucket starting to trend down in Retail Services, that is also an important indicator in terms of how we look at the expected losses, if you will, in the go forward.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2025,Q1,Mark Mason,And so that seasonality as well as that trend is a good sign.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2025,Q1,Jane Fraser,"We've also, I think one of the pieces Gonzalo and the team have done a good job with is, they've been proactive and tightening risk and acquisitions and existing programs in the last couple of years.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2025,Q1,Jane Fraser,And I think that also puts us into another reason where we feel in a good position as we head into whatever lies ahead.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2025,Q1,Ken Usdin,Very good.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2025,Q1,Ken Usdin,And one just a follow-up on NII and your outlook.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2025,Q1,Ken Usdin,Did you make any changes to including card fee still in the NII guide?,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2025,Q1,Ken Usdin,Is that now removed?,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2025,Q1,Ken Usdin,Does that fill in there?,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2025,Q1,Ken Usdin,"I know there's a lot of puts and takes given the change in the forward curve, if you can help us understand which curve you're using and some of the balancing act there, that would be great.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2025,Q1,Mark Mason,"So, look, the late fee impact is, for us, is important, and we included it in the range that we had given, and we still feel good.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2025,Q1,Mark Mason,"We've now removed it, obviously, with the changes that have taken place, but we have not changed our range because there's obviously going to be puts and takes that occur.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2025,Q1,Mark Mason,"It does have an impact on the Retail Services print that we have in the quarter and more importantly, the year-over-year that you see there of down 11% because, as you know, we share profits with those partners.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2025,Q1,Mark Mason,"And so that that that down 11% we see in the quarter is informed by last year where we had an assumption that the late fee rule was going to come into play and therefore, we had less profit to share with our partners versus this year first quarter where we've assumed it would not come into play and, therefore, have more profits to share with our partners.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2025,Q1,Mark Mason,"And so important to point that out on Retail Services, which jumps out in USPB, that it's unlikely that we see that downward percentage in the remaining quarters because it's really a byproduct of what we assumed last year.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2025,Q1,Mark Mason,versus this year on late fees.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2025,Q1,Mark Mason,"In terms of the curve and the NII guidance we gave, we assumed two to three [U.S. interest rate] cuts.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2025,Q1,Mark Mason,"We're now assuming a fourth but given the timing and that it would be back-loaded in the year, it doesn't have a significant impact on the NII guidance that we've given, the 2% to 3% ex-Markets.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2025,Q1,Operator,Your next question comes from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,

2025,Q1,Betsy Graseck,Is that right this quarter?,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2025,Q1,Betsy Graseck,And I know you indicated that you're looking to keep pace.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2025,Q1,Betsy Graseck,"And I'm wondering, does that mean at $1.75 billion or does that mean keep pace with the increased Q-on-Q, which was $250 million?","billion, million",no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2025,Q1,Betsy Graseck,"And so, I know you're laughing, just trying to understand how you're thinking about that, given what we discussed last quarter, which is you have so much opportunity here for buyback and the accretion is so powerful.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2025,Q1,Betsy Graseck,"So, if you don't mind.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2025,Q1,Mark Mason,"So, look, we're targeting a similar level.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2025,Q1,Mark Mason,"As you know, we've been working to bring the CET1 [Capital ratio] down.","capital ratio, cet1",yes,Yes,"cet1, capital ratio",No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,

2025,Q1,Mark Mason,The uncertainty is multifaceted.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2025,Q1,Mark Mason,"And to some extent, you think about the uncertainty with the SCB.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2025,Q1,Mark Mason,"We'll hopefully get some clarity on that as we often do in the summer, and that will inform the pace at which we bring that that down.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2025,Q1,Mark Mason,"And then there's the broader market uncertainty, and we want to obviously be there to support clients, and the demand may come on the heels of that.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,

2021,Q2,Jane Fraser,We've been expanding and growing talent in the front line as well and are very pleased as well with the investment product revenue growth which is where from a mix point of view we see the greatest upside for us.,revenue,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q2,Jane Fraser,"So early days in the execution of this, but I think pleasing progress as we pull this together into this single integrated offering, invest behind it and you'll see the benefits in terms of growth as well as obviously return and revenue mix going forward for the bank.",revenue,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q2,Mark Mason,Yeah.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,

2021,Q2,Mark Mason,"So Private Bank revenues up 4%, continued strong growth in client assets up 26% including AUMs that were up 29% and deposit strength, et cetera.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q2,Mark Mason,"And as Jane mentioned, even as we invest in strengthening the platform, we just announced yesterday that we were launching the self-directed investment digital offering which, again, is targeted towards US Consumer and Wealth Management clients.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q2,Mark Mason,And so good progress while we invest and position ourselves to capture further opportunity here.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q2,Operator,Your next question comes from Ken Usdin with Jefferies.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q2,Operator,Please proceed.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q2,Ken Usdin,Wanted to ask you a little bit just on capital.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q2,Ken Usdin,"When we got the SCB results, you had indicated a dividend of at least $0.51 and implied that you'd be buying back stock, but just wondering if you could help us just flush that out a little bit more in terms of how we should be thinking about the type of capital return or any increases that you might consider on the dividend from here?",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q2,Ken Usdin,And how to put that into context with prospective changes in the SCB and your minimums?,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q2,Mark Mason,"Look, the first thing I'd say is that as you can tell through the second quarter, we bought back as much as the regulatory rules would allow for in the way of the average four quarters of net income.",net income,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q2,Mark Mason,And so we continue to be very excited about the prospect of continued capital return.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q2,Mark Mason,"As it relates to the SCB and the recent results, as you know, we have a target of approximately 11.5% from a CET1 ratio point of view.",cet1,yes,Yes,cet1,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,Yes,cet1 ratio
2021,Q2,Mark Mason,The target includes an estimate for the stress capital buffer that's somewhere between 2.5% and 3%.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q2,Mark Mason,"Up until this recent set of results, the prior couple had been at the 2.5%.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q2,Mark Mason,The 3% will go into effect at the end of the third quarter.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q2,Mark Mason,"And more importantly, we will actively manage the drivers that impact that stress capital buffer.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q2,Mark Mason,"That is to say, PPNR as well as the balance sheet, risk weighted assets, and we intend to do so with an eye towards how we bring that stress capital buffer back down.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q2,Mark Mason,"As we think about capital actions, as you know, with the SCB in place, we have the flexibility to take those decisions in a given quarter in line with the reg minimums and we intend to do that.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q2,Mark Mason,"Given where the stock trades, it makes a lot of sense for us to be buying back shares and so we'll continue to skew towards that.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q2,Mark Mason,"And as of right now, our dividend is going to remain at the $0.51, but as I mentioned, we will continue to lookat that quarter-to-quarter, given the flexibility from the SCB.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q2,Jane Fraser,"And the only piece I'd add in is as we're doing this work on the strategy and the plans going forward, both Mark and I have a high degree of confidence around the capital generating capability of the franchise and look forward to returning excess capital to you over and above what we'll be doing to invest and close that return gap with our peers.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q2,Operator,Your next question will come from Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q2,Operator,MATT O’,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q2,Connor,I just wanted to follow up on the dividend commentary.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q2,Connor,"I understand the preference to buy back stock and you're very explicit about wanting to do that below tangible book, so that makes sense.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q2,Connor,"But I guess just kind of signaling the market, keeping a stable dividend, is there like a message there about the underlying earnings power or limited ability to increase the dividend?",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q2,Connor,"Because I'd think you'd want to at least top it up by a couple of pennies, just to kind of signal a positive trend, because it doesn't take that much capital to do that.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q2,Connor,"So maybe you can elaborate a little bit on the dividend, again specifically on should we read into implied underlying earnings power?",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q2,Connor,Are there any limits on increasing the dividend?,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q2,Mark Mason,Yeah.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q2,Mark Mason,Let me be very clear.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q2,Mark Mason,There's no underlying message there at all.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q2,Mark Mason,It's as I stated in terms of where the stock is trading and it making sense to do buybacks.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q2,Mark Mason,Our dividend yield is quite comparable to that of peers at close to 3%.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q2,Mark Mason,And so – and there's no constraint on our ability to take capital actions.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q2,Mark Mason,And we don't have any concerns about the earning power of the franchise.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q2,Mark Mason,"And in fact, many of the areas, as I mentioned earlier and as Jane has mentioned, we know are going to contribute to continued strength in our earnings power.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q2,Mark Mason,"So, well capitalized.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q2,Mark Mason,We feel good about our earnings power and no concerns or no underlying message to the capital actions and direction of them that we spoke to.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q2,Mark Mason,"And again, we have the flexibility given the stress capital buffer as we go quarter-to-quarter to adjust as we see fit in the best interest of our investors.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q2,Operator,Your next question will come from Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q2,Operator,"Hello, Steven, your line is open.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q2,Steven Chubak,"Mark, I was hoping to unpack just some of the NII guidance.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q2,Steven Chubak,I think there was just a little bit of confusion how it should be interpreted.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q2,Steven Chubak,"So, it sounds like we're down $2.2 billion year-to-date and that the full year we shouldn't see any incremental declines from there.",billion,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q2,Steven Chubak,So that would imply about $10.5 billion NII run rate in the back half.,billion,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q2,Steven Chubak,I just want to make sure that's the right way to interpret the remarks.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q2,Mark Mason,Yeah.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q2,Mark Mason,"So, look, again, we do see kind of the NIR stabilizing and you see some of that particularly ex-markets but also in total on the page.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q2,Mark Mason,"Again, the guidance for total revenue is unchanged at down mid-single digits.",revenue,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q2,Mark Mason,"You're right, as of the half, we're at down $2.2 billion as relates to net interest revenues.",billion,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q2,Mark Mason,"Look, the markets component of that can often be hard to predict, but what I'm suggesting is that any offset or any further pressure there will be offset likely in the fee momentum that we expect to see given the strength coming through this quarter.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q2,Operator,Your next question will come from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q2,Mark Mason,"Hey, Betsy.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q2,Betsy Graseck,"Oh, hey.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q2,Betsy Graseck,"I did have a question for Jane and you, Mark.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q2,Betsy Graseck,"The question has to do with how you're thinking about the importance of scale in the business refresh, I guess, I could call it that you're doing?",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q2,Betsy Graseck,"And Jane, really, maybe you could help us understand how important scale is in what you're looking to execute here?",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q2,Betsy Graseck,"I ask because many times I get questions from investors around what is Citi doing on the pieces of the business that don't have as much scale as the standout areas like Global, Fixed or Treasury Services or Mexico.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q2,Jane Fraser,"First of all, scale is clearly very, very important here, particularly in a more digital world and as you point out, Betsy, TTS, for example, has – we're moving $4 trillion of volume a day around the world and we've got a number of franchises that have material scale and we only expect them to be growing and this is where the transformation program will be very helpful in ensuring the scalability of our platforms.",trillion,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q2,Jane Fraser,We made the decision on Asia Pac and EMEA to exit the 13 markets where we didn't believe that we would be able to achieve the scale needed to compete in those very local part of the business so that we can focus our firepower in those areas where we're either ensuring we retain a leading market position or in other areas where we want to be investing to attain the scale that we think is going to be needed going forward.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q2,Jane Fraser,US Consumer is an obvious example of that.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q2,Jane Fraser,"So I think as we – you'll hear from us going forward, more and more focus around what are our plans for those businesses for retaining the leading positions in this, aided by the transformation program, or in the areas where we'll be investing to attain greater scale and as I say, US Consumer is the obvious one.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q2,Jane Fraser,There are pockets in Commercial Bank we're excited by.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q2,Jane Fraser,"Securities Services is one where we think it is very readily attainable, particularly given our pre and post trade capabilities and part of that scale, finally, will come from the linkages between our businesses as we create more connectivity.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q2,Jane Fraser,"That will also provide us scale, so collectively the different franchises we have will be competitively advantaged and not just individually strong.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q2,Operator,Your next question will come from Ebrahim Poonawala with Bank of America.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q2,Operator,Please proceed.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q2,Ebrahim Poonawala,"Just a follow-up – understand you're being deliberately in strategy leading up to, I guess, the Investor Day you mentioned next – first quarter next year.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q2,Ebrahim Poonawala,"But as we think about just the investment spend and the expense outlook, handicap, Mark, if you could, the risk that we could see a little bit of an expense creep as you dig further deeper into this, both in terms of your guidance for mid-single digit expense growth this year and as we think about just the duration of that investment cycle over the next few years.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q2,Mark Mason,Yeah.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q2,Mark Mason,"Look, again, this is something that we control, right?",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q2,Mark Mason,"So, again, I want to reiterate that we are making very deliberate decisions around the opportunities that we see across the franchise.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q2,Mark Mason,"And it's the right thing to do, right?",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q2,Mark Mason,So we're going to continue to do that.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q2,Mark Mason,"In terms of kind of risk to it, I don't think there are any surprises here, right?",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q2,Mark Mason,"If revenues come in meaningfully different, there's a certain component of our expense base that's tied to revenues and so that would obviously move around.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q2,Mark Mason,"But aside from those volume-related expenses, transaction, compensation, et cetera, you should expect what I've guided towards in terms of the very deliberate decisions to put the money to work in this fashion and we're going to continue to do that.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q2,Mark Mason,"If we see more investment opportunities in 2021 or 2022, we're going to go after them because, again, we know that we can deliver on the benefits and the returns that are associated with putting that money to work.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q2,Operator,Your next question will come from Gerard Cassidy with RBC.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q2,Gerard Cassidy,"Mark, you said something interesting about the Investment Banking business revenues.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q2,Gerard Cassidy,I think you said that they were 39% or 38% higher than 2019.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q2,Gerard Cassidy,I'm checking my notes here.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q2,Gerard Cassidy,"So your business is still nicely above the 2019 levels and we came through a period up until the pandemic that you're well aware of that it was somewhat challenging, the growth in Investment Banking and Trading businesses.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q2,Gerard Cassidy,"As you look forward when you talk to your people in Investment Banking and in Global Markets, where do they see this?",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q2,Gerard Cassidy,Because there seems to be an elevated amount of business due to what we just came through in the last 18 months.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q2,Gerard Cassidy,Do they think it's sustainable or do we get back to a 2019?,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q2,Gerard Cassidy,What are those guys telling you about the next 12 to 24 months in those businesses?,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q2,Mark Mason,Yeah.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q2,Mark Mason,"I'd start by saying we continue to have very, very good dialogue with our clients across the franchise and specifically in Investment Banking.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q2,Mark Mason,"And if you think about it, many businesses, many companies across industries are really having to take a look at their business model and think about how they want to transform their businesses coming out of this pandemic.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q2,Mark Mason,"Everything from how to think about digitization, how to think about going direct to consumers, what the pandemic means for supply chains, how people work remotely, how they manage their liquidity levels, what to do with that excess liquidity.",liquidity,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q2,Mark Mason,Should they be buying or what?,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q2,Mark Mason,"And so we're part of that dialogue, which is incredibly representative, I think – it represents strongly the franchise that we have.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q2,Mark Mason,The general view from our clients is optimistic in terms of the go-forward environment.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q2,Mark Mason,"Yes, there's some things to kind of manage to, but there's a general level of optimism.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q2,Mark Mason,"And so what I represented relative to 2019 is while we are seeing normalization, we're normalizing at a higher level than where we ended in 2019 and we'd expect continued momentum and we'd expect to continue to take share over time.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q2,Mark Mason,"Jane, anything you want to add to that?",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q2,Jane Fraser,Yeah.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q2,Jane Fraser,"Mark, I think you covered it very well.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q2,Jane Fraser,There's a high level of client engagement with us at the moment really around the world and a lot of demand.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q2,Jane Fraser,"We're seeing in addition to the Investment Banking side, this shift to e- commerce with clients needing our TTS services, our cross-border flows.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q2,Jane Fraser,We're seeing this translating into demand in trade starting to pick up nicely.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q2,Jane Fraser,The Commercial Banking side is another area that we're seeing a lot of new demand coming through from clients both from strategic activity with our investment bank as well as their own expansion globally that we're supporting them through our Treasury Services and the like.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q2,Jane Fraser,So I think there's a general sense of optimism.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q2,Jane Fraser,We have a fabulous pipeline.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q2,Jane Fraser,"One never wants to jinx these things, but we really have a fabulous pipeline heading into the second half of the year around the world and it does give you a good sense of confidence of continued momentum.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q2,Operator,Your next question will come from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q2,Mike Mayo,I'm going to ask my question here and then re-queue.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q2,Mike Mayo,The real question is just on capital.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q2,Mike Mayo,"I mean, you're not blind to the fact that your tangible book value is $78 and your stock price is $68.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q2,Mike Mayo,"So, we should probably be selling your desk chairs and your silverware and anything you can to buy back your stock, I would think.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q2,Mike Mayo,"So, along those lines, the first question is when you're looking at these sales of assets, 13 Consumer markets, do you expect to have a gain on those or a loss on those relative to where they're marked currently?",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q2,Mark Mason,Yeah.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q2,Mark Mason,"So, look, I mean, I think I'd tell you, Mike, that we, as Jane mentioned, we've seen strong interest from buyers as it relates to those assets.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q2,Mark Mason,"And there's no surprise, just given we think those are good businesses, just not of scale as Jane mentioned for us.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q2,Mark Mason,"We've got to run that process through and see what that results in and I'll continue to be transparent with you as to where gains and losses or how it flows through our financials, but I'm not going to sit here and tell you whether it's gains or losses or what it means specifically for those 13 markets.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q2,Mark Mason,"What I will tell you is that as capital is freed up from those transactions, we'll continue to make very deliberate decisions around what to do with that capital, first, looking at growth opportunities that can deliver returns above our cost of capital, and then looking towards how we can return as much of it to shareholders as it makes sense in the form of buybacks, dividends, et cetera.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q2,Mark Mason,And we've been disciplined about that to date and we're going to continue to be disciplined about that.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q2,Mike Mayo,"So, to clarify, if I got this right, your CET1 ratio is 11.9% and your return on capital above 11.5%.",cet1,no,Yes,cet1,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,Yes,cet1 ratio
2021,Q2,Mike Mayo,"So, if you were to quantify the dollar amount of that, how much would that mean in potential buybacks at this point and then I assume that would not include any capital freed up from any sale?",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q2,Mike Mayo,"So, you could have potential to buy back a lot of stock if you were willing and able, is that correct?",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q2,Mark Mason,A little bit over $4 billion of excess capital between the 11.5% and the 11.9% and so that's what that equates to.,billion,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q2,Operator,Your next and final question will come from Vivek Juneja with JPMorgan.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,

2021,Q2,Vivek Juneja,A couple.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q2,Vivek Juneja,"Mark, any comments on promotional trends that you're seeing in card pricing, given everybody is back focusing on the business?",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q2,Vivek Juneja,"You mentioned marketing spend, but can you talk a little about what you're seeing in promotional pricing in that?",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q2,Mark Mason,Yeah.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q2,Mark Mason,"I guess, what I'd say is simply that as expenses would suggest and as we stated, we are legging back into bringing on new card customers.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q2,Mark Mason,"And so – and what we're seeing is that our acquisitions are largely at pre- COVID, pre-crisis or pre-pandemic levels and, frankly, we're seeing normal behaviors as those card customers come on.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,

2021,Q2,Jane Fraser,"So with Google Plex and several other tech partnerships that we have in the States and elsewhere in the world, we're very deliberately going about creating a broad suite of APIs and partner integration capabilities so that we're able to integrate other partners into our offerings, develop more innovative solutions without necessarily having to build it or buy it all ourselves.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,

2021,Q2,Vivek Juneja,"Given that you're headed towards a higher GSIB bucket, Mark, Jane, what you're all thinking in terms of that, in terms of not just capital targets, anything you can do about that, because I know that's a year – a little over a year away from going into effect, but obviously, you're thinking about target capital, we'll have to keep in mind what's coming down the pipe for you.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,Yes,gsib,No,,No,,No,

2021,Q2,Mark Mason,"And we look at the entire capital stack holistically, the 11.5% target in our case, which is well above reg minimums, but certainly does consider that in it.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q2,Mark Mason,"And there are elements of that, as I mentioned earlier, that we can influence and control.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q2,Mark Mason,"So the stress capital buffer is part of that, and I talked earlier about our ability to influence those levers without having full understanding of the Fed models, we know we can influence PPNR, we know we can influence the balance sheet and how it gets allocated and ultimately, what stress losses come out of it.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q2,Mark Mason,And so we will continue to manage that.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q2,Mark Mason,"We will still have a buffer obviously, even with a higher GSIB score.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,Yes,gsib,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q2,Mark Mason,"And as you know, regulators continue to talk about capital as being at about the right levels in the system and they'll continue to look at drivers that influence the stack as well, including GSIB and balance sheet size, et cetera, and we'll see how that evolves.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,Yes,gsib,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q2,Mark Mason,"But again, we feel good about where we are.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,

2022,Q2,Mark Mason,Where the pressure is going to come is in the non-interest revenue.,revenue,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,

2022,Q2,Mark Mason,"And that mix is important when you think about betas, when you think about sensitivity and how they play out particularly in a rising rate environment at the pace that we've seen.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q2,Mark Mason,And that pace varies for both the US versus the non-US currencies.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,

2022,Q2,Mark Mason,"Now, for us, that's going to skew towards non-US dollars.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q2,Mark Mason,"About 80% of that would be non-US dollar, about 20% US dollar.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q2,Mark Mason,And that shift is in part because we've seen already a significant increase in the US.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q2,Mark Mason,"We've seen some increase in non-US, but nowhere near the magnitude that we've seen in the US.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,

2022,Q2,Mark Mason,"And so what happens is in this rising rate environment and the activity from a volume point of view, we've seen an increase in the net interest income that we've generated, and what that means is that there's more – fortunately, more profits to share with our partners.",net interest income,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q2,Mark Mason,The sharing of those profits play through the non-interest revenue line.,revenue,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q2,Mark Mason,"So it comes out as a fee, as a contra revenue, as we share those with clients.",revenue,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q2,Mark Mason,So that's the driver of the swing that you see happening there or the pressure that we have in PBWM as it relates to Retail Services.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q2,Mark Mason,"In terms of the cards growth, the cards growth we feel very good about it.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q2,Mark Mason,There certainly is an environmental dynamic that's playing out as it relates to consumers and corporates.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q2,Mark Mason,"But what I would say is that you've also heard us describing more marketing spend, more advertising spend, more acquisitions, 18% growth in acquisitions.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q2,Mark Mason,"We've been targeting growing our customer base there, while staying within our risk appetite, and the parameters that we've set and been very disciplined about.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q2,Mark Mason,And that's started to pay off.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q2,Mark Mason,And that is part of what I'd describe in terms of the loan growth that is materializing.,loan growth,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q2,Mark Mason,"There's nothing that we see of significance as we grow these loans, that would suggest, one, that they're outside of the focus that we've had to-date, because they're not, nor that there's any material risk in terms of outsized losses.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q2,Mark Mason,"If you look at our loss rates, our loss rates are for Branded Cards 1.5%, Retail Services 2.6%.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q2,Mark Mason,"Those are 50% of what we would normally what we used to describe as a normal loss rate, NCL rate, through a cycle.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q2,Mark Mason,"And so, we feel very good about the loans that we're growing.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q2,Mark Mason,"There's obviously risk, but we also feel very good about the reserves that we have.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q2,Operator,Our next question will come from Erika Najarian with UBS.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q2,Operator,Your line is now open.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q2,Erika Najarian,"My first question is actually a follow-up to John's question, Mark.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q2,Erika Najarian,"I think that, it's always been more challenging to forecast net interest income for Citigroup.",net interest income,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q2,Erika Najarian,And the net interest income and net interest margin certainly surprised to the upside.,net interest income,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,Yes,net interest margin
2022,Q2,Erika Najarian,"So, I guess, let me re-ask the question.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q2,Erika Najarian,"Appreciate the $2.5 billion for each 100 basis point in parallel shift, but as we think about the US forward curve, how should we think about the trajectory of net interest income from that $10.58 billion from here?","billion, net interest income",no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q2,Erika Najarian,"And clearly, as we think about a deposit base that's two-thirds wholesale, how should we think about both deposit flow, deposit growth, and deposit beta as we think about the second half of the year?",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q2,Erika Najarian,"In other words, does the rate of change quarter-over-quarter accelerate, flatten out, or decelerate?",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q2,Mark Mason,"Yeah, there's a lot there.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q2,Mark Mason,"But, I mean, I think what I'd say is a couple of things.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q2,Mark Mason,"One is, we've obviously seen a rapid increase in rates, and that the speed at which rates increases matters a lot as it relates to the betas, and so particularly on the wholesale corporate side.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q2,Mark Mason,"And so, we have seen betas increase there.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q2,Mark Mason,They're probably at about to slightly a little bit better than we would have expected.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q2,Mark Mason,But we would expect that momentum to continue in the back half of the year given the forecast for continued rate increases.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q2,Mark Mason,"The other thing that I'd point out just given your point around the ability to forecast from a Citi point of view, if you look at the first half of the year, we did about, I think it was $1.8 billion or so over the prior year, ex-Markets.",billion,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q2,Mark Mason,"So, NII ex-Markets, $1.8 billion year-over-year first half.",billion,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q2,Mark Mason,"To give you a bit more guidance on how we're thinking about it in light of the rate curve and in light of our mix, I'd tell you that I expect about another $1.8 billion or so in the back half.",billion,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q2,Mark Mason,"So that's probably year-over-year 8-ish percent or so on a full-year basis based on, again, our mix, our assumption around betas and our current assumptions around how the curve would likely play out.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q2,Mark Mason,Let me pause there and see if Jane wants to add anything to that.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q2,Jane Fraser,"Yeah, I'd also add in, our institutional deposits account for about 65% of Citi's deposit base, but 55% of them are operational deposits.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q2,Jane Fraser,"And the TTS deposits have increased by $134 billion since pre-COVID, but the operational deposits increased by $141 billion, and the non-operating decreased.",billion,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q2,Jane Fraser,"So, with QT on the horizon, we'd certainly expect the amounts of deposits in the system to shrink.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q2,Jane Fraser,"We anticipate this would primarily impact non-operating balances, and I think we feel very good about the stickiness of the deposit base we've got, and particularly internationally where these are operating accounts that are extremely sticky, frankly, in all environments.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q2,Mark Mason,Good point.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q2,Erika Najarian,"And just my follow-up question is that was really an impressive capital build this quarter, particularly since it's been an issue with investors, and especially since the SCB came out.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q2,Erika Najarian,I think a piece that we may be missing as we think about the continued build to 13% is sort of what the CET1 benefit is from slide 19.,cet1,no,Yes,cet1,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q2,Erika Najarian,"So, similar to sort of the, I guess it was 12 basis points accreted from the Australia sale.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q2,Erika Najarian,"Is there any way you could give us a range on, as the deal close for the Philippines, Thailand, Bahrain, Malaysia in the second half of the year, how that could boost your CET1 and get you closer to that 13% bogey?",cet1,no,Yes,cet1,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q2,Mark Mason,"Yeah, I guess let me kind of answer it in a more fulsome way, if you don't mind, and then I'll certainly make sure that I give you a sense for the contribution of what we expect from divestitures to the capital impact.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q2,Mark Mason,"So, again, there are a couple of drivers that are going to be important to us building to ultimately the 13% for as long as that is place given the SCB.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q2,Mark Mason,One is obviously the income generation.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q2,Mark Mason,"And with a very strong quarter as it relates to income generation, I feel good about the back half of the year as I've just given you some guidance on.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q2,Mark Mason,"The other is, don't forget we've had 160 basis points on the two-year since the beginning of the year to the end of the first quarter in terms of rate increases, another 60 bps in the second quarter.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q2,Mark Mason,"And it's going to be – there were AOCI impacts from that, 34 bps in the first quarter, and as we point out here, another 12 bps in the second.There's a pull to par that we expect to start to play out and continue to play out in the balance of the year.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q2,Mark Mason,That's going to be an important factor.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q2,Mark Mason,"The third, as you've heard us mention is, we've been working very hard to optimize our RWA and we'll continue to do that.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q2,Mark Mason,We've paused the buybacks.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q2,Mark Mason,That's a factor.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q2,Mark Mason,"And then as you mentioned, the divestitures, the close to $1.5 billion or so in Australia, I've talked about in the past about $4 billion for the year in terms of capital impact, I'm at about $3.5 billion with Australia is what I'm currently expecting.",billion,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q2,Mark Mason,"And so, a little bit less than what I had talked about before, in part because of some of the movement in terms of the timing of some of these closings.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q2,Mark Mason,Still feel good about it.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q2,Mark Mason,Just it's a difficult market that we're managing through.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q2,Mark Mason,"So that $3.5 billion total should give you a sense for how that translates into a CET1 impact that we're expecting, at least through the balance of this year, and obviously there'd be more to come as we continue to close out – and sign and close out some of the remaining deals.","billion, cet1",yes,Yes,cet1,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q2,Jane Fraser,"Yeah, I mean, I rather suspect that at the end of all of this, we're going to have an overabundance of capital.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q2,Jane Fraser,And I really feel good that Citi is already very well-positioned for any environment.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q2,Jane Fraser,"And as Mark said, we have a confluence of various factors going on, I mean, some of which are temporary, that are causing this rapid buildup of capital for the industry.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q2,Jane Fraser,"But I think we're extremely well-positioned for what lies ahead in terms of strong capital ratios, total liquidity resources.",liquidity,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q2,Jane Fraser,"Portfolio credit quality is extremely high, well reserved.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q2,Jane Fraser,"And so, we are very much looking forward to resuming share buybacks as I said once we've achieved this build, particularly given where we're trading, and I want you to hear loud and clear that commitment.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q2,Operator,Our next question will come from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q2,Operator,Your line is now open.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q2,Mike Mayo,I'm trying to figure out if you're lucky or smart.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q2,Mike Mayo,"And the reason I say that is, at your Investor Day, I mean, right upfront you said you have five core interconnected businesses led by Services, led by TTS, and then a few months later you have your best quarter in a decade.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q2,Mike Mayo,"And it just seems so coincidental that you highlight that as a growth area and then just a couple of quarters later, boom, here we are.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q2,Mike Mayo,"So, how much of that TTS growth is simply because of one-off factors in the markets, in other words it won't repeat?",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q2,Mike Mayo,"How much of it is due to a higher baseline, because of, say, interest rates?",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q2,Mike Mayo,And how much of that is due to market share gains?,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q2,Mike Mayo,"And just remind us what TTS and Security Services is again, because I think you got everyone's attention with this quarter?",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q2,Jane Fraser,"So, why don't I kick off and then I'll pass it to Mark.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q2,Jane Fraser,"And it's a danger here of how long you have, Mike, because there's a lot to talk about.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q2,Jane Fraser,So I would encourage you to sit at the beach this weekend and have an excellent read of the supplement because we've provided you with a lot of good facts and proof points and information both around the Services businesses and the others about the early progress on the strategy.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q2,Jane Fraser,"TTS was able to fire, as I said, on all cylinders this quarter.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q2,Jane Fraser,About two-thirds of the performance was driven by business actions and one-third was by rates.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q2,Jane Fraser,"And as Mark said, very active management of the deposit base, beta discipline across all the regions, and the NIR growth that you saw was driven by cards, by payments, by receivables, and by trade.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q2,Jane Fraser,"When you look in the strategic drivers we laid out at Investor Day this quarter, cross- border transaction value up 17% year-over-year, clearing volume up 2% in US dollar, commercial comp spend up 62% as that business recovered, average trade loan balances up 14%, average deposit balances up 2%.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q2,Jane Fraser,"So that two-thirds that was not rates related has a very broad and substantive set of drivers behind it, that as Mark said, puts us into a very strong position for continued momentum here.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q2,Jane Fraser,This level of year-over-year growth is very pleasing.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q2,Jane Fraser,But we would expect to see it revert to the medium term guidance we gave you at Investor Day over time.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q2,Jane Fraser,"But, no, this was across the board all elements firing.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q2,Jane Fraser,"And I will give a shout out to Shahmir, the Head of TTS, as well as to our Security Services team.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q2,Jane Fraser,"But he has really instituted a culture of intensity, of tremendous focus, of discipline in how he is running the business as well.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q2,Jane Fraser,And I think that is also a contributing factor to the confidence that you're hearing from us about this.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q2,Jane Fraser,"Mark, do you want to explain what TTS and Security Services is?",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q2,Mark Mason,"Again, as you've heard us describe, the TTS franchise is core to our business.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q2,Mark Mason,It provides obviously a network to the large multinational clients in over 90 countries.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q2,Mark Mason,We manage the full swath of their working capital and cash management needs.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q2,Mark Mason,We also provide trade financing for them and their vendors and partners.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q2,Mark Mason,And this is essentially in many ways what differentiates our franchise from others.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q2,Mark Mason,"And not only is it in and of itself a core growing high-returning business, but it's one of the businesses that is well connected to the rest of the franchise when you think about the Markets business that we have and the FX that we manage on behalf of clients.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q2,Mark Mason,"And so – and this is a particularly relevant time for us to be engaged with those partners as they manage through supply chain issues and we're there to again help them work through those things and provide them alternatives to their production and operations, and similar type services we provide to our investor client base from a Security Services point of view.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q2,Mark Mason,"Look, the strategy here did not start with Investor Day.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q2,Mark Mason,"That is, we obviously spent time with you talking about that, but this has been a part of the franchise that we've been investing in on an ongoing basis, and it's important that we continue to do that.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q2,Mark Mason,"Investments in technology, investments in onboarding of new clients and the services we provide, in enhanced digital capabilities, in the operations, so all of those things.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q2,Mark Mason,And some of that what you see here is those investments starting to pay off.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q2,Jane Fraser,And the same is exactly true in Security Services.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q2,Jane Fraser,"So, I think the answer to your question is, no, we're just being very disciplined.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q2,Mark Mason,Well said.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q2,Operator,Our next question will come from Ken Usdin with Jefferies.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q2,Operator,Your line is now open.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q2,Ken Usdin,Just a...,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q2,Ken Usdin,...follow-up on the RWA.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q2,Ken Usdin,"When you talk about the premium of the $3.5 billion, and can you help us just discern between what is a numerator impact and what's the RWA impact of the sales that have been announced?",billion,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q2,Ken Usdin,"And just as a related, just how far are you through the RWA optimization efforts, how much more could you really see doing there?",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q2,Mark Mason,"Yeah, so the – thank you.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q2,Mark Mason,"The $3.5 billion I referenced is all capital, so all numerator impact is what I'm describing.",billion,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q2,Mark Mason,"It's both the, you know, any premium that we get or impact gained from sale as well as the RWA that we have allocated as part of that business, and so that all kind of flows through from a numerator point of view.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q2,Mark Mason,"In the case of Australia, for example, that would include both the RWA that we had attributed to that business as well as the CTA impact coming back into capital.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q2,Mark Mason,"So, remember, we took a hit when we signed the deal associated with the CTA.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q2,Mark Mason,I kept communicating that that would neutralize when the deal was closed.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q2,Mark Mason,"In fact, it did.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q2,Mark Mason,And that contributes to the roughly $1.5 billion there.,billion,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q2,Mark Mason,"In terms of RWA optimization efforts, it's a continuous effort.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q2,Mark Mason,"We are constantly working through the balance sheet to make sure that it's allocated to clients who generate the highest prospect for growth and leverage the breadth of the franchise, and we're going to continue to do that.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q2,Mark Mason,"And I think the team did a very good job in ICG and particularly in Markets this quarter in making sure that we made progress against the revenue to RWA metric that they've been using, which is a proxy for returns.",revenue,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q2,Mark Mason,They worked very closely with clients to manage the recycling of trading inventory in a optimal way to optimize collateral positions and postings that we have to increase initial margins on derivative trading where that makes sense.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q2,Mark Mason,"And so, they've been actively working the balance sheet, and we're going to continue to do that.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q2,Mark Mason,"We want to be there to serve our clients, but we want to make sure that we are generating an appropriate return for the use of capital.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q2,Jane Fraser,"And it's part of the shift that we've been instituting, Paco and Andy, in Markets and across ICG and across the firm in our commitment to our shareholders to be more returns focused and to be managing the business differently that way, and this is a very obvious example of that, because it's multi dimensional.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q2,Operator,Your next question comes from Ebrahim Poonawala with Bank of America.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q2,Operator,Your line is now open.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q2,Ebrahim Poonawala,"I guess just around capital, Mark, this is a two-part question.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q2,Ebrahim Poonawala,"One, am I hearing you right that you're not going to leave the door open for buybacks until you get to 13%?",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q2,Ebrahim Poonawala,"Appreciating what Jane said about some of the transitory impact from AOCI, why not be a bit more opportunistic?",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q2,Ebrahim Poonawala,"And just tied to that, what's the risk that some of these deals get pushed out?",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q2,Ebrahim Poonawala,I see slide 19 where you've extended the timeline for a few deals.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q2,Ebrahim Poonawala,"Given just the macro backdrop, like, is that a real risk or do you feel pretty good about the updated timelines?",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q2,Mark Mason,"Yeah, sure.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q2,Mark Mason,"So, look, I mean, we are obviously going to take it quarter-by-quarter as it relates to buybacks and from a capital point of view.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q2,Mark Mason,"Again, without going through all of the things that reflect the environment that we're in, you can see the uncertainty that's out there.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q2,Mark Mason,"Obviously, the capital requirements with this SCB for the industry are higher.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q2,Mark Mason,That's unfortunate.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q2,Mark Mason,We feel as well the right amount of capital was in the industry already.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q2,Mark Mason,We've got to manage through that.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q2,Mark Mason,It's a reg requirement.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q2,Mark Mason,We're going to do that.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q2,Mark Mason,But we'll – SCB gives us the opportunity to take those decisions quarter-by quarter.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q2,Mark Mason,We're pausing for now.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q2,Mark Mason,"And next year there will be another DFAST process, and there will be an SCB that comes out of that.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,Yes,dfast,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q2,Mark Mason,And frankly we should have the strength of higher PPNR that we've been generating to help contribute to what that outcome looks like.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q2,Mark Mason,"So, we'll take that quarter-by-quarter.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q2,Mark Mason,"In terms of risk related to divestitures, again, we did highlight we're being very, very transparent with you all and with the world, and we do see some delays that we highlighted from our original schedule that's in the back of the presentation there, but we feel very good about getting to closure there, and it's not an if, it's a when, and we feel like we're on track with the schedule that we've highlighted for you.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q2,Operator,And your next question comes from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q2,Operator,Your line is now open.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q2,Betsy Graseck,One more capital question.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q2,Betsy Graseck,"So on slide 8, you do give the medium-term outlook here for what you see as your long-term goals for capital, the 11.5% to 12%.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q2,Betsy Graseck,"And so, implicit within that is an expectation that your reg minimums would fall to somewhere 200 basis points or so, and I get that the exits will be part of that.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q2,Betsy Graseck,"Is there a sense you can tell us, as you get more simplified, what the SCB benefit would be?",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q2,Betsy Graseck,"I thought it was something like 25 basis points, but I must be off there.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q2,Mark Mason,"Look, I mean, the 11.5% to 12% is consistent with what we talked about at Investor Day.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q2,Mark Mason,"And the medium-term, as you know, Betsy, for us is three to five years.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q2,Mark Mason,"We've got a couple of things that we're working through, not the least of which are the divestitures.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q2,Mark Mason,"They will certainly contribute to that, but so will some of the other things that I've mentioned including utilization of the DTA, the AOCI pullback and things of that sort.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q2,Mark Mason,"The divestitures certainly will help from an SCB point of view, but I think the stronger performance that we're seeing will aid in that as well.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q2,Mark Mason,"And importantly, the mix change that we expect to come from executing on our strategy, a mix towards more sustainable, predictable earnings, earnings that are coming from some of the areas of growth that we demonstrated this quarter like TTS and Security Services, et cetera, et cetera.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q2,Mark Mason,"So, there's time there.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q2,Mark Mason,"There's obviously a management buffer component of that that I think is certainly an important factor and consideration as we evolve our mix, and then there's the GSIB score with not only a reduction in the divestitures that will impact peak-to-trough losses, there's also deposits that will go away with those and balance sheet evolution that will contribute to a reduction in the GSIB score as well.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,Yes,gsib,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q2,Jane Fraser,"Yeah, let me just underline a couple of points.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q2,Jane Fraser,"When we built our strategy, it wasn't only to generate greater returns, but it was to lower our capital requirements over time as Mark said.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q2,Jane Fraser,And you can see how we're executing that both in terms of the shift in mix and the divestitures.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q2,Jane Fraser,"Obviously, we don't control the regulatory capital framework, but we're not managing for short-term shifts in SCB.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q2,Jane Fraser,"As you know, the banks experience considerable variability in the SCB each year.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q2,Jane Fraser,It's very much depending on the scenario chosen.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q2,Jane Fraser,So that's why we continue with our commitment and confidence around the medium-term.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q2,Operator,Our next question will come from Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q2,Operator,Your line is now open.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q2,Jane Fraser,Hey Steven.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q2,Steven Chubak,"So, I had a follow-up question for, arguably for Mark on NII.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q2,Steven Chubak,"As the Fed continues down the path of balance sheet normalization, I just wanted to clarify whether that $1.8 billion increase in NII you cited for the back half assumes stable deposits or some QT-related attrition.",billion,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q2,Steven Chubak,"And within ICG specifically, are there any insights you can share on what drove the increase in Markets NII and how that should traject just given the historical liability sensitivity within the Markets business?",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q2,Mark Mason,"On the first point, when I think about the back half of the year and quantitative tightening, I do expect that we will see some continued deposit growth, as I mentioned earlier.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q2,Mark Mason,The pressure from quantitative tightening I think will certainly play out over time.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q2,Mark Mason,"But again, our focus is on growing the operating deposits that we have with clients, and we think we've got good traction and ability to continue momentum with those operating deposits.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q2,Mark Mason,"And again, they put us in a position to really broaden the relationship with both those multi-national clients as well as with some of our commercial clients where we've been getting good growth and momentum from.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q2,Mark Mason,"So, yes, likely would be an impact across the industry, but we believe we can get some continued momentum particularly on the operating deposits that we have with clients.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q2,Mark Mason,"In terms of Markets NII, I mean, you've got the European dividend that plays out in the second quarter, so that obviously is a factor there.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q2,Mark Mason,"And again, I'd point you to – when we talk about Markets, I really like to talk about total revenues, because the nature of the security and the trading and the activity that we do there can have an impact on NII and NIR, and what really matters is the total revenues that we're driving and generating out of that franchise.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q2,Mark Mason,"And as you can see, we did 25% growth in Markets revenue year over-year.",revenue,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q2,Mark Mason,So a very good quarter for the Markets team for sure.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q2,Operator,Our next question will come from Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q2,Operator,Your line is now open.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q2,Operator,MATT O’,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q2,Connor,Can you elaborate on your comment about why the Russia exposure is kind of less of a risk or it's a better mix than it was a few months ago?,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q2,Connor,"And then maybe related to that, quantify how much of the $8.4 billion is to subsidiaries of MNCs which does seem like it'd be much, much lower risk?",billion,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q2,Mark Mason,"So, look, what we've been doing very actively since the beginning of the year and certainly in the quarter as well has been working – we've been working to bring down our exposure in Russia and specifically with the clients that we serve there.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q2,Mark Mason,"And so, that direct exposure in a local currency dollars, we brought down by some $900 million or so in the quarter.",million,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q2,Mark Mason,"We brought down and reduced the cash and deposits that we have by another $1.7 billion or so, and then continued to bring down third-party related exposure by another $400 million, and that's been through working with clients to pay those exposures and loans down, and in some instances giving them incentives to do so and incentives to move their deposits out as well.","billion, million",yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q2,Mark Mason,"So, very active engagement from the team as it relates to that.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q2,Mark Mason,What's happened with that is the mix of the exposure that we have or that remains has skewed towards the higher-quality names and towards the global subsidiaries that we have in the country.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q2,Mark Mason,"And so, with that mix shift to better quality names and the reduction in exposure, that's allowed for us to take down the reserves that we had related to the direct exposure in the quarter.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q2,Mark Mason,"And so, that has been, I think, very good progress in terms of that reduction.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q2,Mark Mason,"It gets overshadowed a bit with the ruble impact, but we've made good progress and we're going to continue to actively do that.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q2,Mark Mason,"Approximately – Jane, do you want to jump in on that?",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q2,Jane Fraser,"Yeah, yeah, no, I was going to jump in in terms of just sort of overall, let's be very clear.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q2,Jane Fraser,We are systematically crunching down the size of our franchise.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q2,Jane Fraser,"And as Mark says, the severe stress loss scenario is probably the best indicator of that, which is now roundabout the $2 billion, and materially reduced down.",billion,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q2,Jane Fraser,And we completely changed the nature of our exposure.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q2,Jane Fraser,"Particularly when you think about today, most of our clients are multinationals, and many of the exposures there have parent guarantees against them, which is very helpful.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q2,Jane Fraser,What are we doing with them?,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q2,Jane Fraser,"Many of them, that we're helping them with their exit from the countries.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q2,Jane Fraser,"And that obviously, as you can all appreciate, takes some time.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q2,Jane Fraser,"So, for those that are able to exit swiftly, that's another factor that can help us reduce down our exposure presence and indeed our operations.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q2,Jane Fraser,"There are also others, though, that it is harder.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q2,Jane Fraser,"I think we've all seen how difficult it is to disconnect the Russian economy from the West in a couple of key sectors, in particular food and in particular energy.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q2,Jane Fraser,"And as you can imagine, given the nature of our bank, we've been in the middle of some of those flows that are essential for the West and the multinationals that are supporting it.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q2,Jane Fraser,"And so, you have a bit of a blended story here in terms of, yes, we're helping those that connects to exit, but we're also still playing the role that we have to and have been asked to in maintaining some of those flows.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q2,Jane Fraser,We anticipate that they will continue to reduce over time as the energy and food security issues get addressed.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q2,Jane Fraser,But it's a complex environment.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q2,Jane Fraser,"And bottom line, you can hear us, we're pleased with how this has been managed by our teams.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,

2022,Q2,Gerard Cassidy,"If the market conditions remain this way in the second half of the year and into 2023, just for Investment Banking, not Markets, your trading business, when do you guys have to take a sharper pencil to the expenses in that division, or do you just let it run?",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q2,Jane Fraser,Maybe I kick off and then pass it over to Mark.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,

2022,Q2,Jane Fraser,And we've brought in some very strong bankers there.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q2,Jane Fraser,"It obviously takes a few years to build share, build out the client relationships, and to see the full fruits of those investments.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q2,Jane Fraser,"We're also focused on the broader opportunity by leveraging investments in commercial banking, I'm sure Mark will talk about that as well, and in Markets and the connectivity there.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q2,Jane Fraser,"So I think you're going to see us take a strategic look at this and a long-term look rather than just a shooting from the hip on the expenses side, because we're building the firm for the long-term here.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q2,Jane Fraser,We'll certainly be incredibly disciplined around expenses.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q2,Jane Fraser,You've seen that with us this quarter.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q2,Jane Fraser,"We've talked about what we'll do on expenses across the board in the firm as we become simpler in tackling stranded costs, our organization structure, et cetera.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q2,Jane Fraser,"But we're very serious about the investments that we're making into some of the core talent in these areas, and you shouldn't be expecting us to make any significant material shifts right or left on this one.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q2,Jane Fraser,We're deadly serious.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q2,Jane Fraser,Mark?,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q2,Mark Mason,"Jane, I think that's well said.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q2,Mark Mason,"The only thing I would add is that the business is capital light and is high returning through the cycle, and so we see a lot of value there.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q2,Mark Mason,"We want to be prepared to ramp up when activity starts again, and as you've said, it's quite strategic for us.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q2,Mark Mason,"Since you kind of wound me up on the commercial banking activity, I have to jump at it.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q2,Mark Mason,"We had, as you know, Jane, a very strong quarter in commercial banking.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q2,Mark Mason,"When I look at the revenue momentum there, just kind of leveraging the breadth of the franchise, we're probably up 25% to 30% in revenues in that part of the business.",revenue,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q2,Mark Mason,"And I know that's part of our – as you know, that's part of our core growth strategy that we talked about at Investor Day.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q2,Mark Mason,"So, good momentum in that part of the franchise as well.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,

2022,Q2,Andrew Lim,"So, I was just wondering how you think about recession, because some of the investors that we talk to, they look at the savings ratio, it's back to pre-pandemic levels.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q2,Andrew Lim,They look at mortgage affordability and it's really quite dire.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,

2023,Q2,Glenn Schorr,You can correct that if that's wrong.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Glenn Schorr,"But just usually, those things are big important clients that have relationship lending, things attached to them.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Glenn Schorr,"So, I'm curious on how you balance the capital benefit, the clear capital benefit, versus client impact and how you think about that?",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Glenn Schorr,Are there other blocks of business that are in motion right now?,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Mark Mason,"Thanks Glenn and good morning, and thanks for the question.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Mark Mason,"Look, a couple of points on that.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Mark Mason,One is we've been very focused on the revenue to RWA metric in our Markets business in the ICG more broadly as well.,revenue,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Mark Mason,And we've made considerable progress on that.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Mark Mason,And that's important because how we use the balance sheet and ensuring that we're optimizing the use of the balance sheet contributes to how we improve returns over time.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Mark Mason,"You're right to point out the subscription facility, credit facility, lending that we do.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Mark Mason,We brought that down pretty significantly.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Mark Mason,The numbers you highlight are a lot higher than the portfolio.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Mark Mason,"But what's important here is that as we look at that, we look at a couple of things.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Mark Mason,"So, one, the nature of relationship and whether clients are taking advantage of the breadth of what we have to offer.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Mark Mason,"Two, the profitability and returns associated with the product to the extent that it is in a broader relationship, and where those returns are low, subpar, and the prospect for doing more has proven to be fruitless, we take it down.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Mark Mason,"And that's what we've done with a large part of that book, just as we juxtapose it against other opportunities to use balance sheet where clients are taking advantage of the broader franchise and therefore, are generating higher returns.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Mark Mason,And we're going to continue to do that.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Mark Mason,We've done that to drive the revenue to RWA metric.,revenue,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Mark Mason,We've done it selectively on pieces of the portfolio like SCF.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Mark Mason,"We've also looked at our broader corporate lending portfolio and where those promises for higher relationship returns aren't manifesting themselves, we've not renewed those loans.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Mark Mason,"And as we think about pending regulatory changes, proactively making these efforts becomes critically important.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Mark Mason,"When I look back on the activity that we've done over the past couple of years, we've reduced RWA by approximately $120 billion over the last 2 years, and about 75% of that is predominantly driven by balance sheet optimization and looking at client activity that has low margin business.",billion,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Mark Mason,"And so,this is important for us to do and to keep doing.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Glenn Schorr,"I appreciate that, Mark.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Glenn Schorr,Maybe just a quick follow-up.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Glenn Schorr,"On NII, I asked this last quarter too.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Glenn Schorr,And your first half annualized ex-Markets is running about $1.5 billion ahead of the guide.,billion,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Glenn Schorr,"Is that just unpredictable nature all the moving parts, trying to be conservative or anything else in the back half that you're thinking about?",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Mark Mason,We did take guidance up to slightly above $46 billion from the $45 billion.,billion,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Mark Mason,"I guess there are a couple of things ex-Markets, of course.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Mark Mason,There are a couple of things to think about in terms of headwinds and tailwinds that play through there.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Mark Mason,"One is you've heard me mention before that we've reached terminal betas in the U.S. Two, deposit volumes and the shift mix as we see consumers kind of move into higher-returning type, higher-yielding type products.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Mark Mason,"And three, really the wind-downs and the exits and the reduction that they will play out in terms of NII.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Mark Mason,So those are kind of 3 headwinds as we think about the forecast and the balance of year.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Mark Mason,"There are obviously some potential tailwinds that play to the other side, including rate movements in non-U.S. dollar as well as Card volume growth.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Mark Mason,"And as we look at those headwinds and tailwinds, our current read is to take it up, but $46 billion or slightly above that feels like the right level in the context of total revenues at $78 billion to $79 billion.",billion,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Operator,And our next question comes from Jim Mitchell with Seaport Global Securities.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Jim Mitchell,Maybe just getting on the expense side.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Jim Mitchell,You're keeping Mexico until 2025 now at the earliest.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Jim Mitchell,So that will be on the books longer.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Jim Mitchell,How do we think about that bend the curve discussion?,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Jim Mitchell,"And maybe specifically, you can help us think about bending the curve for the non-legacy businesses.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Jim Mitchell,Do we start to see is the fourth quarter just a slowing or quarterly decline?,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Jim Mitchell,Is it a year-over-year kind of a discussion?,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Jim Mitchell,I just want to make sure I understand the whole bend the curve notion and how to think about that.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Mark Mason,Let me take that.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Mark Mason,I'd say a couple of things.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Mark Mason,"So, one, I'd reiterate the expense guidance that we've given for the full year.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Mark Mason,"So that's the roughly $54 billion ex-divestitures, or the impact of divestitures, ex-any impact from FDIC special assessment.",billion,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,Yes,fdic,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Mark Mason,"Two, as we think about bending the curve, I look into 2024 and we're looking to bring the absolute expense dollars down from Q3 to Q4.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Mark Mason,So that bending of the curve will occur.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Mark Mason,It will occur despite having Mexico still part of the franchise.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Mark Mason,"And obviously still having Mexico impacts the magnitude of the bend, but it will bend Q3 to Q4.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Mark Mason,"And then beyond that and through the medium term, we will see the curve continue to bend.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Mark Mason,"Again, Mexico impacts the magnitude of the bend, but we're very, very focused on bringing our costs down and bending that curve.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Mark Mason,"And you've heard us reference the aspects or the elements of our business that help contribute to that, not the least of which are the exits, one of which is Mexico, and you referenced the timing there, but also the benefits from investments that we've been making in transformation and risk controls and shifting from manual processes to technology-enabled ones.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Mark Mason,And then the final one is around simplifying our organization.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Mark Mason,"And you heard in Jane's prepared remarks, as we continue to make progress on these exits, it opens up the opportunity for us to lean more heavily into that simplification.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Mark Mason,"So, we are focused on not only the guidance, but the bending of the curve as you point out and looking forward to delivering that and taking actions to ensure we do.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Jim Mitchell,"So just as a follow-up, is the way to think about sort of 2025 and beyond as you get through a lot the automation on the sort of the non-legacy businesses and start to get much more efficient there.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Jim Mitchell,Is there an absolute expense decline story in the core business?,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Jim Mitchell,Or is that more that you need the top line growth to get the improved returns?,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Mark Mason,"Again, it's going to be a combination of continuing to bend the curve and bring our expenses down.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Mark Mason,"Obviously, we've given you guidance on operating efficiency of less than 60%, which will be some of that top line growth, but it's the combination of the two.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Operator,And our next question comes from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Betsy Graseck,I just wanted to confirm on the CET1.,cet1,no,Yes,cet1,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Betsy Graseck,You know you have the 100-basis point buffer on top of regulatory minimums.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Betsy Graseck,"So that would suggest that the 13.3% that you got this quarter is in-line with where you're planning on holding it going forward, is that fair?",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Mark Mason,"So, you're right, we hit 13.3% this quarter, down a tad bit from the 13.4% last quarter.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Mark Mason,"Effective October 1, the 4.3% SCB comes into play.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Mark Mason,"And so that would equate to, assuming the 100-basis point management buffer, a 12.3% regulatory requirement and a 13.3% kind of target that we would manage to.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,Yes,regulatory requirement,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Mark Mason,"I'd highlight a couple of things that I'm sure are obvious to you, Betsy.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Mark Mason,One is this is the stress capital buffer for the 12-month period starting October 1.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Mark Mason,"And two is the strategy that we've described and talked about and have started to execute against is intentionally designed to help morph the business towards a more steady, predictable, consistent stream of revenues, fee revenue growth as well bring our expenses down over time, and exit these markets, and those things should contribute to reducing our stress capital buffer over time and improving our returns.",revenue,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Mark Mason,"But the answer to your question very directly is, yes, the 13.3% would reflect where we'd be targeting as of October 1 for now.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Betsy Graseck,And since you mentioned you're evaluating buybacks quarter-by-quarter.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Betsy Graseck,"I guess the question here is, how should I think about that relative to, we get Basel endgame coming out soon because clearly, when you re at 13.3% against the new reg cap SCB, you know it signals a bigger opportunity for buybacks over the coming quarters.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Betsy Graseck,So how should I think about that?,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Jane Fraser,"I think that consistent with what we've been talking about, there's a lot of uncertainty out there about the new capital requirements, both in terms of the nature of them and the timing of implementation.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Jane Fraser,I think the industry is expecting to get more clarity about that with the comment period that will be coming up.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Jane Fraser,"Plus, it's a fairly uncertain macroeconomic environment at the moment, so both Mark and I feel it's prudent to continue making that assessment until some of this uncertainty is clarified as to what precisely do.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Jane Fraser,"You should take confidence that we're at the levels, including the management buffer that we expect to be for the rest of the year.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Jane Fraser,We've proven a good case of being able to build capital that's for sure over the last 2 years.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Jane Fraser,"And you take comfort as well we increased the dividend, we had $2 billion of capital returned last quarter, so our intentions are clear to return capital where we can, but also to be prudent in how we do so, given environment and current regulatory uncertainty.",billion,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Operator,Our next question comes from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Mike Mayo,"One negative question, one positive question.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Mike Mayo,"So, on the negative side, you talked about bending the cost curve, but I think second quarter year-over-year, it's bending the wrong way, and 6 quarters from now, you're saying it should bend the other way.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Mike Mayo,"So, what are we not seeing in the financials that gives you such confidence?",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Mike Mayo,"Because it seems, based on this quarter's results, a little bit more of a trust me story.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Mike Mayo,"And on the positive side, TTS, continued double-digit growth, you continue to invest more in that business, how are you monetizing greater money in motion among your multinational and other clients?",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Jane Fraser,"Thanks Mike, I'll kick it off and then send it back to Mark.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Jane Fraser,"In terms of the expense side, I think we've been very transparent about the arc of our investment spend related both to the transformation and beyond.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Jane Fraser,"We'll continue to give you that transparency, Mike.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Jane Fraser,"Note last year, we hit our expense guidance.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Jane Fraser,"This year, we're on track for the guidance of roughly the $54 billion, ex-FDIC and divestitures and looking forward, we continue to guide what are the 3 levers that will drive the reduction in the expense curve starting at the end of '24.",billion,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,Yes,fdic,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Jane Fraser,It's from exits and I think you've got a clear sense around the progress that we have been making on the divestitures.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Jane Fraser,"And therefore, we're pivoting, as we talked about, to focus now on really tackling the stranded expenses as we close off the final couple of sales there in Asia in the next few months.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Jane Fraser,We'll realize the benefits from our investments in transformation and controls over the medium term.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Jane Fraser,We'll also have the benefit of the remediation work getting done and expenses going away from that.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Jane Fraser,"And then the third one will be simplifying the organization, as we talked about.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Jane Fraser,"So, we'll continue to walk you, step by step, what are the different actions we're taking, what are we doing, and hopefully we are building up that track record of doing what we will say we are going to do every quarter.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Jane Fraser,"Mark, anything to add?",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Mark Mason,"n the expense side, and then you may want to touch on the TTS, but the only add on the expense side is, we are taking repositioning charges, Mike.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Mark Mason,I mean we're not sitting still as we go through this uncertain period of time where wallets across certain parts of the industry are under significant pressure.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Mark Mason,"And in taking those repositioning charges, there are going to be expense reductions that ultimately play out over the next 12-month period.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Mark Mason,So that's the other factor in addition to what Jane mentioned in the way of exits and benefits from the transformation that will play into the cost base over the next 12 months.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Jane Fraser,"And then on TTS, I think we all share your enthusiasm for this business in terms of the growth potential that we've been realizing and expect to continue, albeit converging now to the medium-term guidance over the next few quarters where we see it's a high to medium single-digit growth going forward.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Jane Fraser,It's a very high-returning business and some of the indicators of how we're monetizing those relationships.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Jane Fraser,"We're seeing it both in terms of new client wins, they were up 41% this quarter.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Jane Fraser,We have a sustained win-loss ratio of 80% on the new deals across different client segments.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Jane Fraser,We're also seeing growth that's starting to really kick in from our commercial bank and the expansion of clients in the middle market around the world as we grow out that franchise.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Jane Fraser,"And we've got some very good fee-growth, which as Mark points out, and I point out all the time, we're very focused around, so cross-border up 11% U.S. dollar clearing up 6%, commercial cards up 15%, etc.. And we continue to invest in the business as well, so to make sure that 80%-win ratio continues.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Jane Fraser,"So, first bank to launch 24/7, 365 dollar clearing, U.S. dollar clearing.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Jane Fraser,We've got the instant payments platform we just launched for e-commerce clients.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Jane Fraser,"We have Payments Express that is now live in the U.S., on track for 5 markets by the year-end.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Jane Fraser,"So, it's a story of innovation investment, it's got great returns.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Jane Fraser,"It's a good growth story, and it just, it keeps on going.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Jane Fraser,And I don't want to diminish Securities Services in there either.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Jane Fraser,"It's another business that's, similarly, continuing to see significant client wins, up 65% versus last year as well.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Jane Fraser,And a lot of our strategy there has been focused on gaining share with the asset managers in North America.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Jane Fraser,"Couple of years ago, we're down at 2.6% share.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Jane Fraser,We're up about 4.3%.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Jane Fraser,Our target is about 5.5% there in 2025 in that key growth area.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Jane Fraser,I know there's a lot to like here too.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Operator,And our next question comes from Erika Najarian with UBS.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Erika Najarian,"So, I apologize having to ask the expense question again, but I think it's just very important because there's really two potential long-only investment thesis on Citi, right?",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Erika Najarian,One is the buyback given your tangible book values at $85 and the and the stock at $46 other is the spending the curve on expenses.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Erika Najarian,So let me just ask Jim's question another way.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Erika Najarian,"In looking back to 2017, and I'm just looking at 2017 because I can break out legacy and core that way.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Erika Najarian,"And fast forward to 2022, you produced revenues ex Legacy Franchises about $61 billion in 2017 and about $67 billion in 2022.",billion,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Erika Najarian,"The associated expenses, again, without Legacy Franchises was about $34.5 billion in billion in 2017 versus $43.5 billion 2022, so you're surpassing the revenue uplift during that period by $3 billion.","billion, revenue",no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Erika Najarian,"I guess the question is, you have so much certainty about the timing of this expense and I'm wondering how much of this $9 billion can go away?",billion,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Erika Najarian,"We understand that there's a lot of opportunity for reinvestment in the core business, but I think all of us are struggling to really understand that magnitude.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Erika Najarian,And I think that the investor base in the market fully understands the Legacy Franchise story and how the exits will take time.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Erika Najarian,But I think they're most interested in the core business and how much of that can come out.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Mark Mason,"Look, no need to apologize for asking the question again, it's an important topic.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Mark Mason,I'd say a couple of things.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Mark Mason,"So, one is that we can certainly look back in time, but I would highlight that we're here because we needed to have invested more in our franchise.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Mark Mason,"And so undoubtedly, there's going to be an increase in our expense base that reflects the underinvestment from the past and in shoring up safety and soundness and actually moving towards a more automated operational, more modernized operations and infrastructure.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Mark Mason,"So, there's certainly going to be that.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Mark Mason,"With that said, with those investments come efficiencies.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Mark Mason,"So, with the move from manual to automation over time, those types of investments will yield benefits in our cost structure.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Mark Mason,And that's part of what is going to bend the curve over that medium-term period.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Mark Mason,"The other thing that I'd highlight is, obviously, with the Legacy Franchises, there's $7 billion of expense associated with those, and that will come down.",billion,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Mark Mason,"But because of the Mexico transaction, we're going to be stuck with that a little bit longer given the IPO process.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Mark Mason,"It doesn't put a big dent in our ability to bring stranded costs down and by the way, it does come with top line revenues and historically has been accretive to our profitability and returns.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Mark Mason,"And so, I'm not going to give you kind of new guidance on where our expenses will end up.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Mark Mason,"But what I will point you to is not only the $54 billion this year, roughly $54 billion this year, not only the bending of the curve in the third and fourth quarter or the third to the fourth quarter next year.",billion,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Mark Mason,"But we've given guidance on top line growth, revenue of 5% call it CAGR through that medium-term period, and we've given you kind of operating efficiency targets that we've said as well, and we intend to deliver on those things that reflect the bending of that curve through all of those drivers that we've mentioned.",revenue,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Mark Mason,"So, I hope that helps, Erika.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Mark Mason,I appreciate the focus on both capital and expenses.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Mark Mason,We are equally focused on it and know just how important it is to achieving those targets.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Mark Mason,"We're not only kind of doing the things that we've highlighted in that strategy articulation, but we're also being responsive to the current environment that we're in.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Mark Mason,"We think that aids in our ability to deliver the targets and the bending of the curve, and we know there's an additional opportunity that Jane has referenced to the simplification of the organization as we make -- what I would argue is considerable progress on the exits towards the end of this year.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Mark Mason,"And all of those things will be important to ensuring we get to that lower cost base, which we will do.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Jane Fraser,And it's a laser micro focus from us to make sure that we have the plans in place and the execution to be able to achieve it.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Jane Fraser,"This is something we're extremely hands-on around and making sure that, going to get done on each of the different drivers that Mark talked about.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Erika Najarian,And just a follow-up on that.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Erika Najarian,"I guess, you guys have been you guys have been pretty clear on the timing, and pretty clear on why the curve will bend.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Erika Najarian,"I guess I'm wondering, is it just a timing issue that you're not giving us the sort of the dollar numbers that could go away from the transformation?",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Erika Najarian,Is it just a timing issue?,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Erika Najarian,Or are you still at a point where you don't know how much of that you would need to reinvest to arrive at that 5% revenue CAGR?,revenue,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Mark Mason,"Sorry, your question was around expenses or the revenue?",revenue,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Erika Najarian,Expenses.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Erika Najarian,"So, we get loud and clear why the curve will bend.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Erika Najarian,"We get loud and clear when the curve will bend, right?",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Erika Najarian,And there's clearly just expenses there that are catch-up expenses that are transformational expenses to everything that Jane talked about.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Erika Najarian,And that message has been loud and clear.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Erika Najarian,"And I'm wondering if you haven't told us what could come out of those expenses because it's just a timing issue, it's July 14th versus 4Q'24?",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Erika Najarian,Or have you not yet made decisions in terms of how you may allocate those expenses in terms of do you need some of those expenses that could come out to grow your revenue base to that 5% CAGR versus having it fall to the bottom line?,revenue,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Erika Najarian,"Sorry, that's the question.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Mark Mason,"So, I'd say a couple of things.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Mark Mason,"So, one, Erika, is obviously, with that revenue CAGR will be volume-related expenses that play out.",revenue,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Mark Mason,"But we're also focused, obviously, on the non-volume-related expenses and not giving you a precise number because the magnitude of that bend, right, is a factor, right?",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Mark Mason,"So obviously, Mexico, for example, as I mentioned earlier, impacts the magnitude of the bend, right?",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Mark Mason,"And we're going to, and have, in fact, when you look at our expense base even for the quarter, we've spent money in Mexico to drive that top line 22% revenue growth, 10% ex-FX.",revenue,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Mark Mason,"And so, there are going to be nuances in the running of the business in a way that ensures we're maximizing shareholder value that impacts the magnitude of the bending of that that expense curve.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Mark Mason,Investments that I got to continue to make in in TTS order to maintain that #1 position and that that competitive advantage we have.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Mark Mason,And so those things will impact that magnitude of the bend.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Mark Mason,"We've been, I think, very transparent as we get into each year, giving you concrete numbers.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Mark Mason,What I'm telling you is the curve will bend.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Mark Mason,"And as we get closer to 2024, we'll give you more direction on the magnitude for that year and beyond.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Operator,Our next question comes from Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Steven Chubak,Wanted to ask a question on capital.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Steven Chubak,"Just given the recent increase in your SCB, I was hoping to better understand why the 11.5% to 12% remains the appropriate long-term objective in your mind?",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Steven Chubak,"And as we prepare for Basel III endgame, think through the capital benefit from future asset sales, can you speak to whether that will translate into operational risk capital relief specifically as it's less clear whether those benefits will accrete even as those asset sales are consummated?",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,Yes,basel iii,No,
2023,Q2,Jane Fraser,"I'll kick it off, Mark, and then pass it to you.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Jane Fraser,So we're confident we're going to meet 11% to 12% RoTCE target over the medium term.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Jane Fraser,The core drivers of how we get there remains unchanged.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Jane Fraser,"One, it's the revenues that we expect to grow by 4% to 5% CAGR as we continue to execute on the strategy.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Jane Fraser,"On expenses, it's the clear path to bend the curve by the end 2024, bringing those expenses down over the medium term.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Jane Fraser,"And third and importantly, it's continuing to optimize our balance sheet, including improving RWA and capital efficiency.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Jane Fraser,"And as we referenced earlier in the prepared remarks, different drivers in that, that are helpful, exiting 14 international consumer markets, changing our business mix.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Jane Fraser,"And I'd also note that the transformation has benefits not only for our efficiency, but it will also support RWA and capital optimization.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Jane Fraser,"That said, there's uncertainty around the future capital requirements in the industry and importantly, the timing of their implementation.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Jane Fraser,We like everyone again to have to work through those implications once we know what they are.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Jane Fraser,"But as we said, keep in mind, we've got some other levers to pull over time, capital allocation, DTA allocation and utilization, our G-SIB score and our management buffer of 100 basis points.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Jane Fraser,So that's where you hear the confidence from us around the path to executing and that remaining consistent.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Jane Fraser,"But Mark, why don't I hand over to you just around consumer market sales and operational RWA relief.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Mark Mason,"And again, I think that if you look at the transactions that we've closed to date, they've generated or freed up about $4.6 billion of capital the two that remain to be closed and the balance of year will generate another $1.2 billion or so.",billion,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Mark Mason,That will be important to our capital base.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Mark Mason,I think that we obviously have to see the proposal as it comes out and the NPR.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Mark Mason,And we'll have a window to respond to that.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Mark Mason,We're hopeful that the regulators hear our response and views on it as it comes out.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Mark Mason,There's clearly going to be reference to increases in RWA and operational risk implications potentially as part of that.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Mark Mason,"I do think that exiting, without having seen the proposal, and without obviously knowing how those rules might evolve.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Mark Mason,"I do believe that the exiting of these 14 markets does play towards not only reducing our SCB in stress scenarios or as it comes out of stress analysis and tests, but also should play through helping to reduce risk-weighted assets and potentially operational risk as well.",risk-weighted assets,yes,Yes,risk-weighted assets,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Mark Mason,But we have to see what the proposal looks like and go through that.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Mark Mason,"And I think what's important here is that whenever it comes out, whatever it looks like, as we dissect it and go through it, we'll figure out how to manage through it, right, whether that be through exiting certain products, seeking price adjustments as it relates to customers, clients and the markets or continuing to optimize RWAs and we have been doing very proactively, we'll figure out how to manage.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Jane Fraser,"And I feel compelled to jump in here as well because as the spring and the recent test results showed the large U.S. banks are not only in a strong capital position, but we've been able to play an important stabilizing role for the system as a whole.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Jane Fraser,It's a role that we take very seriously.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Jane Fraser,"And we certainly hope that as the details of the capital frameworks get unveiled, this is fully taken into consideration, including the impact on U.S. competitiveness, and we need a level playing field with Europe, not a gold-plated one, and we share the concern that higher capital levels will undoubtedly increase the cost of capital for medium- and smaller sized enterprises and consumers in particular and will drive more activity to non-regulated and lesser capitalized players that isn't in the system's interest.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Jane Fraser,"And we hope that that's fully taken into consideration here because we will take actions on businesses, and we will take pricing actions as will the entire industry.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Mark Mason,Really important point.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Steven Chubak,"Thanks for that perspective, Jane, very well said.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Steven Chubak,Just one quick follow-up for me.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Steven Chubak,"PBWM fee income trends, given the lower partner payments, I mean clearly the Wealth fee trends would suggest that they were quite subdued in the quarter.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Steven Chubak,And I just wanted to understand your outlook over the near medium term what drove some of the weakness this quarter?,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Steven Chubak,"Is it something that you expect will likely persist, especially given some of the market tailwinds that we've been seeing, would have expected to see a little bit more resiliency in Wealth fee income in particular.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Mark Mason,"Look, I think as we mentioned, Wealth was down about 5%.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Mark Mason,"It's really hard to talk the rebound in Wealth in the midst of such an uncertain environment and the one that we're in, it's hard to disconnect those macro factors like rates, inflation, the prospect of a recession from what we're seeing in Wealth.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Mark Mason,And I think there are two dynamics that have played out.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Mark Mason,"One has been the shift from our customers, from customers more broadly into higher-yielding products from out of deposits.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Mark Mason,"And the other has been the fee revenue from an investment management fee point of view, and as you might think about it, it is a higher rate environment.",revenue,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Mark Mason,There are opportunities for clients to earn more.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Mark Mason,And not until there's greater certainty in the broader macro factors will I think we start to see some real momentum tick up there.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Mark Mason,"Now with that said, and a couple of things worth reiterating, which is we're seeing very strong referral momentum from the Retail Banking business up through wealth continuum, if you will.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Mark Mason,"So, we've had about 25,000 referrals May year-to-date from our retail branches into our broader Wealth business, that's a good thing.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Mark Mason,"We've seen the number of clients that we've onboarded tick up pretty meaningfully, both in the Private Bank and more broadly across Wealth.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Mark Mason,That's a good thing.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Mark Mason,Those are things that that position us well for when greater certainty does play out and these clients start to put monies back to work in the broader investment platform and offering that we have.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Operator,And our next question comes from Ebrahim Poonawala with Bank of America.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Ebrahim Poonawala,"Just one quick question, Mark, for you.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Ebrahim Poonawala,"On the consumer cards book, you gave some metrics.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Ebrahim Poonawala,"One, remind us of what you reserved for in terms of unemployment rate, macro, and if we do see a worsening in the markets, does that necessarily mean that we'll see big ratcheting up of credit reserves from where you already are?",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Ebrahim Poonawala,Just some color around that would be helpful.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Mark Mason,"Sorry, just the last part of your question, I'm sorry, if we do see what?",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Ebrahim Poonawala,"So, one, like where are you in terms of your unemployment rate assumption?",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Ebrahim Poonawala,"And if the unemployment outlook worsens, let's say, over the next 6 to 12 months, does that mean that you are already reserved?",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Ebrahim Poonawala,Or will we see another big pickup in provisioning as a result of that?,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Mark Mason,Got it.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Mark Mason,"Look, our current reserves, as you know, as we think about CECL, we've got 3 different scenarios, we've got a base case in upside, a downside.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Mark Mason,Our current reserves are based on the mix of those 3 macroeconomic scenarios.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Mark Mason,"It reflects about a 5.1% unemployment rate on a weighted basis over the 8 quarters, and it's roughly flat to what it was last quarter.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Mark Mason,"What that means is, obviously, our downside scenario has unemployment that's much higher than that, closer to 7% or call it 6.8% or so.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Mark Mason,But that's kind of how we've thought about unemployment.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Mark Mason,"As we think about the reserves each quarter, obviously, we take a look at the macroeconomic factors and how they're evolving.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Mark Mason,"Our base case today assumes a mild recession and reserves in the future will consider how are weighting towards downside, upside and baseline may morph subject to our outlook and volumes.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Mark Mason,Those are the 2 factors that influence whether we're increasing reserves or not.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Mark Mason,"I would point out though that in addition to unemployment and because has been as stubborn as it has been, if you will, we also look at debt service coverage ratio as an important factor as we think about our consumers, as we think about their balance sheet, as we think about the risk that they may or may not be facing.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Mark Mason,"So unemployment is an important factor, but we've flexed our thinking in light of the environment and in light of how behaviors have been shifting, and that's an important factor in how we think about our reserves as well.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Mark Mason,I feel very good about the level of our reserves.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Mark Mason,"You heard us mention earlier, we've got $20 billion of reserves, we're well reserved across the portfolio, but those are all important elements to it.",billion,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Ebrahim Poonawala,That's helpful.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Ebrahim Poonawala,And just one very simplistic question.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Ebrahim Poonawala,"When you talk to some of your largest shareholders, those who are optimistic think you can hit your RoTCE target medium term by 2025.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Ebrahim Poonawala,"Is that a realistic expectation given I appreciate Basel changes, you answered like 10 questions on expenses.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Ebrahim Poonawala,But should we expect the groundwork through '24 that we hit that medium-term target in w25 or just your degree of confidence.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Mark Mason,"Again, the thing I'd point out and Jane, feel free to chime in here, is that what we talked about was getting to our medium-term returns, 11% to 12% and the medium term is 25 to 26, right?",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Mark Mason,"So it's not just 25, just to be clear.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Mark Mason,And we do continue to feel very confident around our ability to do that.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Mark Mason,You heard us mention the levers that we think will contribute to that.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Mark Mason,"Obviously, capital is important and how that evolves, and we continue to kind of work to optimize the balance sheet while serving our clients effectively and importantly, growing the strong businesses that we have that are high returning as well.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Operator,And our next question comes from Matt O'Connor from Deutsche Bank.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Operator,You have mentioned continued normalization of credit card in the back half of the year.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Operator,"And just wondering, you've got the normalized loss rates on Slide 22.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Operator,"Are you still thinking you'll hit those, I think, exiting this year or early next year.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Operator,"And then I think at one point, you said they might go a little bit above that before they kind of come back to a normal level?",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Operator,And is that still the case?,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Mark Mason,The answer is yes.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Mark Mason,"We still expect for both portfolios to hit those normal levels sometime at the end of the year, the normal level, as you pointed out, on the page for both Branded as well as for Retail Services.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Mark Mason,"We would expect, again, subject to how and when this mild recession kind of plays out, we would expect that they would tick higher than that before getting back inside of that range.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Mark Mason,"But again, all of this is tied into how we've calculated our reserves, the delinquencies that we're seeing, the mix of the portfolio, which again skews towards your higher FICO scores and the customer behaviors that we're seeing, which play through not only that cost of credit line, but also plays through the growth that we referenced earlier in the top line.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Mark Mason,"But short answer is yes, that's still our thinking.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Jane Fraser,"And as Mark said, I think we feel good about our positioning as a prime, but also a strong credit proposition that we have.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Jane Fraser,"We're seeing stronger demand for the credit-led products such as value cards, bulk on installment loans as well the service-led engagement for the more prime customers.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Jane Fraser,And so that's also going to be a valuable factor driving growth and profitability as well.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Jane Fraser,"And then the follow-up, and this is not really Citi-specific, but for the card industry, a lot of the banks that are in card.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Jane Fraser,"Everyone is talking about kind of getting to normalized levels, just call it in the near term here next couple of quarters.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Jane Fraser,"And I guess, just thoughts on getting this normalized level of losses when unemployment is all-time low, wages are growing.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Jane Fraser,"Obviously, there's inflationary pressures, but it's just a little surprising, again, not to Citi-specific, but it's a little surprising that we're getting to this normalized state when things seem like they're pretty good.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Jane Fraser,"Yes, I think well, also normalized state back in 2019 was also pretty good.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Jane Fraser,"So, you're not hearing any alarm bells ringing from Mark or myself at all here on the U.S. consumer, I think we see the U.S. consumer as resilient, we've talked about them being cautious but they're not recessionary.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Jane Fraser,And we are seeing more pressure on the lower FICOs.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Jane Fraser,"We don't have a large number of that in our portfolio, but that is where we're seeing more of the normalization happening on the payment rates, for example, and other behaviors in there.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Jane Fraser,"So, it's quite localized, but I don't think we should be overly concerned here about the health of the U.S. consumer.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Jane Fraser,"And as Mark said, we're in a very unusual environment.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Jane Fraser,"Higher inflation, these rate levels and a strong labor market.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Jane Fraser,"And under those conditions, it's the debt service ratio, as he said, that is, we think, is a more useful leading indicator that we keep a close eye on.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Mark Mason,"Just remember, it's a return to normal.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Operator,And our next question comes from Gerard Cassidy with RBC.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Gerard Cassidy,"Mark, can you share with us, in your financial supplement, obviously, you give us good details on your credit picture and we're talking about credit right now.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Gerard Cassidy,The nonaccrual loans have been flat as a pancake for the last 12 months for you folks and the industry as well.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Gerard Cassidy,"And this is in light of the Fed funds rates, as we all know, have been up over 500 basis points.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Gerard Cassidy,"Can you guys share with us why we haven't seen more, this is mostly corporate of course, but everybody has been hanging in there very well in view of the fact that rates have gone up so much.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Gerard Cassidy,What are your customers telling you or are you seeing that has enabled them to remain very healthy in light of a 500-basis point increase in interest rates?,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Mark Mason,"I think I'd point to a couple of things, Gerard.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Mark Mason,"One is, remember, we focus on the large multinational, largely investment-grade quality names.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Mark Mason,And so that's one important factor when you think about our ICG and corporate exposure there.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Mark Mason,The second thing I'd point out is we have to remember that many of these companies had and still have very strong balance sheets and that they've managed that through the COVID and pandemic situation and that has positioned them well.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Mark Mason,I think the third thing is that and you've heard us mention how we're proactively managing the prospect of a recession.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Mark Mason,"And I think when I talk to other CFOs, I know that when Jane talks to other CEOs, they too are looking at their expense line.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Mark Mason,They too are looking at the efficiency of their organizations and opportunity to increase that efficiency in light of a potential slowdown or recessionary environment.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Mark Mason,"And then the final point is, I think a lot of firms have been that were proactive in the low-rate environment, in shoring up that balance sheet strength.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Mark Mason,"Now with that said, you've heard us also mention the prospect of a rebound in capital market activities, and that has to happen at some point.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Mark Mason,"But sticking to your point around credit, I really think it's those factors that you see play through in not only our very low NAL, but also our very low credit losses, credit cost that you've seen in our business.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Gerard Cassidy,"And then as a follow-up, when you think about what we've seen with the Fed's tightening over the last 12 months, banks like your own have positioned the balance sheet accordingly and I know the Bank Analysts Association of Boston, Michael [Verdeschi] did a good job explaining how you guys manage the balance sheet.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Gerard Cassidy,"And when you look at it going forward, do you think changes are coming because the Fed if they end in Fed funds rate increase as we get to a terminal rate, how are you guys positioned the balance sheet, do you think going forward?",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Mark Mason,"Look, we're constantly actively managing the balance sheet in light of not only our client needs, but also how we see the broader macro environment evolving and changing.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Mark Mason,"And as you know, and I know you've seen and we've talked about before, we share in our Qs, our view on our estimate for interest rate exposure and what happens with 100 basis points swing in rates in one direction or another across the curve across currencies.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Mark Mason,"You've seen that shift over the last number of quarters to last quarter where that estimate for IRE was about $1.7 billion or so, but heavily skewed towards non-U.S. dollar rates and currencies.",billion,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Mark Mason,"And I think as we think about the view on how rates will evolve, you'll see a continued shift there.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Mark Mason,"I think that that when we look to print this quarter, number will probably come down a bit in terms of interest rate exposure and skew even more towards non-U.S. dollar currencies in light of where rates are in those markets and the U.S. dollar will likely be somewhat neutral in light of that curve currently looks like.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Mark Mason,"But again, something we actively manage, first with an eye towards what client demand and needs are likely to be for use of our liquidity but also with a view for how the macro environment might evolve and what we're hearing from central banks around the world.",liquidity,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Operator,And our next question comes from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Mike Mayo,"I meant to follow up earlier on the bending of the cost curve, but if you were to put different initiatives in terms of how far along you are maybe like your exits might be in the eighth inning, and your transformation might be in the sixth inning, and your remediation in the fifth inning, the simplification in the first inning or second inning.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Mike Mayo,Are those numbers correct?,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Mike Mayo,How would you put those numbers?,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Mike Mayo,"And in terms of bending the cost curve, where are you further along and where are you just getting started?",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Mark Mason,"Well, Mike, you know I love you, but I'm not going to play that game.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Mark Mason,"What I will say is that we clearly have work that we're doing as it relates to the exits, but making very good progress on that, not just on the closing of the exits but also on putting a dent in the stranded costs associated with those exits that we have closed.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Mark Mason,"And so, as Jane mentioned in her prepared remarks, by the time we get to end of the year, ex-Mexico, we would have made a considerable amount of progress on there, and that creates an opportunity to do more around the simplification of the organization and so that simplification is obviously in an earlier inning, call it, the exits in a later inning.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Mark Mason,"I think that the transformation spend investments and those things, look we are squarely into execution, as you've heard us mention before.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Mark Mason,"And as I've mentioned, the expense base around that is going to continue to morph from spend that we've made around third-party consultants and that helped in the crafting of the plan towards technology, towards people that are critically involved in the execution of it and then a downward trajectory towards the benefits we get from that technology and reduced operational expense.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Mark Mason,"And so, it's a multi-year journey, we've talked about that.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Mark Mason,We've got a number of years to continue to execute against it.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Mark Mason,"But what's important is we know what we have to do, both in how we're investing that money and as it relates to being disciplined about our cost structure and bending the curve.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Mark Mason,"And again, that's what we're going to do.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Mike Mayo,"And one more attempt, can you remind us how many people are working on the transformation remediation and how much that's costing you?",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Mark Mason,"Yes think the number I shared was somewhere around 13,000 people or so that are broadly working on the efforts here.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Mark Mason,We haven't gotten into specific costs; you know it's in the total number.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Mark Mason,But what I would say again is that we're clear on what we've got to deliver and execute against and we're managing that cost very tightly.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Mark Mason,"We're constantly looking at opportunities to deliver on those transformation deliverables, more efficiently, leveraging technology, leveraging AI in some instances.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Mark Mason,And so we're not just taking those execution plans as they were crafted and delivering against them.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Mark Mason,But we're looking for efficiencies and even the execution plans as they're constructed today.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Mark Mason,And that's important for us to keep doing.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Operator,And our next question comes from Ken Usdin with Jefferies.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Ken Usdin,I know this is going long here.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Ken Usdin,"Just a quick one, just, Mark, just wanted to get your sense on the sentiment around client activity in both the Markets group and what the pipelines are looking like in Investment Banking and the feel for that?",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Jane Fraser,"Look, I'll jump in here.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Jane Fraser,Corporates are pretty cautious.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Jane Fraser,"They've got another Fed hike in the offing, tensions in China and the West, OPEC and all, and a general sense of more limited growth.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Jane Fraser,But I think clients have been trying to understand and get their arms around both the macro and the market outlook for a while.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Jane Fraser,I think they now seem to accept the current environment is new normal and are beginning to position themselves globally.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Jane Fraser,"So globally, we're seeing less anxiety around funding as most large corps are biting the bullet and paying higher rates to take advantage of issuance windows, balance sheet is getting reinforced, we certainly don't see a large cap credit prices on the horizon.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Jane Fraser,"And on the IB side, it remains, the pipeline is robust.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Jane Fraser,There's a lot of pent-up demand for M&A but it's hard to predict when that pipeline will unlock.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Jane Fraser,"ECM had tangible momentum over Q1, and we're also seeing sponsor lev fin showing signs of improvement, but both of those are from a very, very low base.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Jane Fraser,"And on the investor side, most of the investors stayed on the sidelines in Q2.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Jane Fraser,"The debt ceiling was a bigger topic than economic news was, and then it was a very low vol environment.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Jane Fraser,"We saw a bit of a pickup at the beginning with the light bump in volatility in the last few days, but I wouldn't call that a trend yet.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Operator,And our next question comes from Charles Peabody with Portales.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Charles Peabody,A question about your Markets related net interest income.,net interest income,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Charles Peabody,"And before I ask the question, I do appreciate that you run those businesses on a holistic basis and that NII is probably more of a residual outcome.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Charles Peabody,But a couple of questions related to Markets-related NII.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Charles Peabody,"First is, you had a pretty nice jump up in the second quarter versus the first quarter.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Charles Peabody,"And I just wanted to understand, is that largely related to seasonal dividend issues?",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Charles Peabody,"And then secondly, you have a positive NII outcome, where a lot of your money center in brethren will have a negative NII outcome for Markets and I was just wondering what the difference is?",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Charles Peabody,Is it the outsized FICC business relative to Equities?,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Charles Peabody,Or is it the international?,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Charles Peabody,Or is it how you hedge?,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Charles Peabody,What's the difference on that?,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Charles Peabody,So those are the 2 questions.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Mark Mason,"Thanks for the question, and thanks for the acknowledgment that we do manage our Markets revenues in total, so I appreciate that.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Mark Mason,"What I would say in terms of the Markets NII is, you've captured it right, which is the dynamic that's playing out between first quarter and second quarter is, in fact, dividend season.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Mark Mason,"And again, given the globality of our franchise, the dividend is not just a dividend in any one region, but dividend in multiple regions playing out over the course of the first and second quarter.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Mark Mason,I can't speak to the peers at this particular stage.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Mark Mason,"But what I would say is that you know that our book skews more so than peers to corporates, and that's important.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Mark Mason,"And we obviously have a very, very strong FICC business more broadly as well.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Mark Mason,"So dividend season, major driver here in that increase.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Charles Peabody,"And just as a follow-up, is there any sort of directional guidance you can give on Markets related to NII?",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Charles Peabody,"I mean does it mean to the extent second quarter was bolstered by dividend, it comes down in the third quarter, but then does it go back up in the fourth quarter?",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Charles Peabody,So would the second half be kind of equivalent to the first half?,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Mark Mason,"Charles, I really appreciate the attempt there.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Mark Mason,"But I'm not going to give any further guidance on the breakout of the NII, I will reiterate the ex-Markets NII increase, by the way, to plus $46 billion but thanks for question.",billion,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Mark Mason,I appreciate that.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Operator,And our next question comes from Vivek Juneja with JP Morgan.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Vivek Juneja,Couple of questions.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Vivek Juneja,"Number one, so capital, Jane and Mark, going back to that, should we expect that given what you've mentioned, given everything going on in the regulatory environment, ratio you're at currently, it should grow in anticipation of what may come or likely to come with all the regulatory stuff?",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Vivek Juneja,Or are you going to try and keep that closer to the 13.3%?,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Jane Fraser,"I think we're going to see exactly what the framework is that comes out and then the implementation time frame for it and then look at making adjustments to plan, also hoping that the comment period is taken seriously and the different considerations I talked about earlier are taken into effect.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Jane Fraser,"Then we'll work through what are adjustments we make, pricing capital reallocation, etc., the playbook that you would expect the same one that we've done with SA-CCR and we've done with a number of other pieces.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Jane Fraser,"And we would also hope to see our SCB in a different place for the same reasons we talked about earlier Vivek, because there's a lot of volatility in that SCB dependent on the scenario that comes out every year.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Jane Fraser,"And I would say, given the shifts we're making in the business model, we'd expect to see that one come down.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Mark Mason,"The only thing I'd add is again, the CET1 ratio of the 13.3% as of October 1, would be a 12.3% reg of October 1.",cet1,yes,Yes,cet1,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,Yes,cet1 ratio
2023,Q2,Mark Mason,"As Jane mentioned, the NPR as it comes out, we'll take a look at that and see if there are implications on the CET1 stack, but more likely implications on the risk-weighted assets, right?","cet1, risk-weighted assets",yes,Yes,"cet1, risk-weighted assets",No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Mark Mason,"And what's really important there aside from the very important points Jane made in terms of considering broader factors is the timing of the implementation of whatever that final rule includes and obviously, the more timing for implementation, the more of an ability it gets for the industry to think about how to absorb the implications there.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Vivek Juneja,But I'm presuming you want to go sooner rather than later because the market is going to expect that rather than take a full 3 years or whatever the Fed might give you.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Mark Mason,"You know what, I'm really interested at this point in seeing the proposal, and then we'll have a chance to kind of, to really react as an industry and as a firm.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Vivek Juneja,"Completely unrelated, if I may.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Vivek Juneja,"Noninterest-bearing deposits, what are you seeing given you're very heavily corporate driven.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Vivek Juneja,"When I look at your point-to-point because you don't give a full average balance sheet, it's only interest-bearing related.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Vivek Juneja,But the noninterest-bearing is only available on a period end.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Vivek Juneja,"If I look at that, there was a big drop in the U.S. this quarter.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Vivek Juneja,Anything unusual?,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Vivek Juneja,Is that accelerating?,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Vivek Juneja,"What are you seeing amongst your clients, people still waking up?",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Vivek Juneja,And what have you factored into your NII guidance for that?,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Mark Mason,"Well, again, I think the point I'd make here is that we continue to see clients shift from kind of noninterest-bearing deposits and into both interest-bearing and CDs and other higher-yielding products in light of the rate environment that we're in.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Mark Mason,And I would expect us to continue to see those types of shifts subject to how rates continue to evolve.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q2,Mark Mason,"And again, on the corporate side, we've seen in the U.S. clients have reached kind of those terminal,that terminal level, terminal betas, I should say, outside of the U.S. rate hikes, I think, are still in the future, as Jane alluded to, and the terminal betas have not quite yet been reached.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,

2024,Q2,Mark Mason,"And as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, you have kind of a compounding effect of multiple vintages now maturing at the same time that's playing through the P&L.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Mark Mason,"That's not just true for us, that's true for others as well.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Mark Mason,And so we'd expect and we are we do believe we're seeing some signs of a cresting when you look at delinquencies now and so we would expect that those losses start to normalize and loss rates start to come down as we go towards the medium term.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Mark Mason,"At the same time, we're investing in the business and we're looking to see continued growth in volume and on the top line.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Mark Mason,"And the combination of those things, as we drive towards the medium term, will help us to deliver both the top line growth and certainly improve returns from where we sit today and in line with what we've guided to.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Mark Mason,"So, it's a combination of top line performance from volume and obviously the environment plays into that, but we feel like we've got a reasonable assumption around top line growth there, cost of credit normalizing, continued discipline on the expense line, allowing for us to get improved returns across that USPB business.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Glenn Schorr,Appreciate all that.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Glenn Schorr,One quickie on DCM.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Glenn Schorr,You had amazingly good performance.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Glenn Schorr,There's been plenty of conversation about pull forward this year on just refi driving like three-quarters of the activity.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Glenn Schorr,Could you just help us think through the second half when thinking about DCM just to make sure that we don't like start modelling this into perpetuity?,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Jane Fraser,"Look, I think when we think about the back half of 2024, we're going to see a different mix of activity in Banking.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Jane Fraser,We do still expect demand to be quite strong across our capital market products because you've got a wall of maturing debt securities coming up in the second half that carry on for a couple of years.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Jane Fraser,"But, we did see some clients accelerating issuances into the first half getting ahead of potential market volatility.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Jane Fraser,"So, if you put it all together, I think we expect the rate environment and the financing markets to continue to be accommodative as well as to continue deal making with M&A being a bit larger in the overall mix, although some of the regulatory elements have put a damper on part of that.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Mark Mason,Yeah.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Mark Mason,"Only thing I'd add to that is, look, the wallet for the year is obviously going to depend on a couple things, so, one, the return of a more normalized IPO market, two, the direction and volatility of interest rates, the ongoing global conflicts that we're all kind of seeing and witnessing, and then finally, as Jane mentioned in her remarks, the elections and what those outcomes look like, not just in the US, but abroad.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Mark Mason,And so there are a number of factors there that will play to the wallet.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Mark Mason,"But as we said, we believe we're well-positioned to be there to serve our clients and to do so in a way that makes good economic sense.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Operator,The next question is from Jim Mitchell at Seaport Global.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Operator,Your line is now open.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Operator,Please go ahead.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Jim Mitchell,Hey.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Jim Mitchell,"Just, Mark, maybe on NII, down almost 4% year-over-year.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Jim Mitchell,Seems a little bit more than the guidance was down modestly for the year.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Jim Mitchell,"So, can you discuss sort of the puts and takes this quarter and how we should think about the quarterly trajectory for the rest of the year?",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Mark Mason,Yeah.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Mark Mason,"So, I'd say a couple things.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Mark Mason,"So, one, as I mentioned, in the quarter and you see it on slide 9, ex-Markets, we're down about 3%.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Mark Mason,"That's largely driven by some FX translation that played through, but also some seasonally lower revolving card balances and then lower interest rates in Argentina.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Mark Mason,"And what that is in Argentina, we have capital there, the policy rate was adjusted downward and as that happened, we obviously earned less on that capital that flows through the NII line.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Mark Mason,"As I think about the back half of the year and the guidance we have of modestly down, there are a couple of puts and takes to keep in mind.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Mark Mason,"So, one is going to be rates, right, so as I think about the higher yield that we can earn on reinvestment, that'll be a tailwind that plays through from an NII point of view.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Mark Mason,"The second would be volume growth, particularly in our card loans portfolio and we do expect to see continued volume growth across certainly the Branded portfolio and so that'll be another tailwind for us on the NII line.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Mark Mason,"In terms of the headwinds, you've got the lower NII earned in Argentina from rates, that'll continue to play through.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Mark Mason,"We've got assumed higher average betas in 2024, specifically on the non-US side.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Mark Mason,"We still have in our forecast the impact of CFPB late fees, so assuming that that goes into effect for this year, that will have an impact and it's in the forecast, and then the impact of lost NII from the exits that we have.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Mark Mason,"And so, the combination of those things will probably mean that NII in the back half of the year is a little bit higher than the first half, but again, consistent with the guidance that we gave of modestly down.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Jim Mitchell,That's helpful.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Jim Mitchell,"And maybe just quickly, kind of a similar question on expenses.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Jim Mitchell,"Better-than expected this quarter, but there was no restructuring or repositioning charges.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Jim Mitchell,"I think to get to the high end of your range, you'd have to be up a little bit in the back half from 2Q run rate.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Jim Mitchell,"Is that because you expect more repositioning, restructuring in the second half or maybe just talk through expense trajectory from here?",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Mark Mason,"Yeah, so that's right.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Mark Mason,"When I talk about it at the first quarter, I talked about kind of a downward trend for each of the quarters after Q1.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Mark Mason,The second quarter came in a bit lower than we were expecting.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Mark Mason,I'm sticking with the guidance and it does mean that the back half of the year will likely come in will come in higher than the second quarter.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Mark Mason,"That's a combination of a couple of things, including the pace of hiring and investment that we will do in the transformation work that has to be done.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Mark Mason,"It also includes repositioning charges that we might take or need to take as we continue to work through our businesses across the firm and the franchise and then the second quarter did or yeah, the second quarter did have a one-time or so and some delayed spending that will pick up in the third and fourth quarter around advertising and marketing and some of the other line items.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Mark Mason,"So, yes, the third and fourth quarter, the back half will be higher than the second quarter, but consistent with the guidance that I've given.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Operator,The next question is from Erika Najarian at UBS.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Operator,Your line is now open.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Operator,Please go ahead.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Erika Najarian,I had two questions and I'll ask the first one on expenses first since it's a good follow up to the previous.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Erika Najarian,"Mark, just to clarify.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Erika Najarian,"Let's just say, take the highest end of your range at $53.8 billion.",billion,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Erika Najarian,Just trying to think about how consensus will move.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Erika Najarian,"So, we take that $53.8 billion and then add the $285 million of FDIC expenses year-to-date so far and add the civil money penalties of $136 million, so that gets us to $54.2 billion for the year and any other repositioning charges in the second half of the year would already be included in the $53.8 billion?","billion, million",no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,Yes,fdic,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Mark Mason,"So, yes.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Mark Mason,The answer to the last part of your question is yes.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Mark Mason,"So in the range that I've given, $53.5 billion to $53.8 billion, that includes our estimate for the full year of repositioning and any restructuring charges.",billion,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Mark Mason,That range excludes the FDIC Special Assessment that we saw earlier in the year and it excludes the CMP of $136 million.,million,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,Yes,fdic,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Erika Najarian,Got it.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Erika Najarian,And my second question is for Jane and I'm sure you're getting tired of the question on capital return.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Erika Najarian,"So, you're buying back $1 billion, you plan to buy back $1 billion this quarter.",billion,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Erika Najarian,It looks like you didn't buy back any in the second quarter.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Erika Najarian,And I'm asking this question in this context because consensus has a buyback of nearly $1 billion in the fourth quarter and staying at this rate for the first half of next year and ramping higher.,billion,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Erika Najarian,"And I guess, is the $1 billion number a catch-up pace because you didn't buy back any in the second quarter?",billion,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Erika Najarian,"And I fully appreciate that you also have the Banamex IPO coming, which is different from peers that are also waiting for Basel clarification.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Erika Najarian,"But I'm just wondering, do we need to wait for that Banamex IPO for the company to feel comfortable moving away from that quarter-to-quarter guidance?",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Erika Najarian,"And also, of course, I just want to readdress the beginning of the question when I asked specifically about the pace.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Jane Fraser,"So, we are not going to be giving guidance going forward around our buybacks.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Jane Fraser,We are going to continue to give quarterly and make it a quarterly determination as to the level.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Jane Fraser,And a lot of that is to do with the uncertainty about the forthcoming regulatory changes.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Jane Fraser,"I think we were delighted to see a slight reduction in our Stress Capital Buffer, reflecting the financial strength and resiliency of our business model and also good to see the benefits of our strategy playing out.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Jane Fraser,"But with the regulatory changes uncertain, that's one of the major factors for us to continue with the quarterly guidance.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Mark Mason,"Yeah, that's right.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Mark Mason,"And on the first part of your question, Erika, I'd say, look, we were in discussions with our regulators and we made a prudent call as it relates to buybacks in the quarter for Q2.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Mark Mason,"So, Q3, as we talked about, would be at $1 billion and that should not be necessarily viewed as a run rate level.",billion,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Mark Mason,"As Jane mentioned, we'll take it quarter by quarter from here.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Operator,The next question is from Gerard Cassidy with RBC.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Operator,Your line is now open.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Operator,Please go ahead.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Gerard Cassidy,"Thank you, Hi Jane, Hi Mark.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Gerard Cassidy,"Mark, regarding the comments you made about the higher credit losses, the three factors that you gave us, can you also talk about, if this was a factor at all for you folks, was there any FICO score inflation back during the pandemic that might be playing into these kind of credit losses?",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Gerard Cassidy,"And as part of the credit card question, you mentioned the CFPB, the fees that you have factored in, the lower fees you factored that into your forward-look.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Gerard Cassidy,Where do we stand on that?,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Gerard Cassidy,Do you guys have any color on that as well?,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Mark Mason,"Yeah, so, on the first part of the question, look, we all kind of have talked about in the past, the prospect of FICO inflation back during the COVID period of time.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Mark Mason,We've been very focused on ensuring that acquisitions that we've made have been appropriately kind of analyzed in the underwriting of that to get comfortable with the quality of new customers that we've been bringing on.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Mark Mason,"In light of the environment, we have looked at moving towards higher FICO scores for new account acquisitions.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Mark Mason,"But as I think about what we're seeing now, there is that dichotomy that I mentioned where we have the higher FICO score customers that are driving the spend growth and that frankly have still continued strong balances and savings and it's really the lower FICO band customers, where we're seeing the sharper drop in payment rates and more borrowing.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Mark Mason,"And so, the FICO inflation has effectively kind of fizzled out when we look at the mix and dynamic of the customer portfolio that we have at this point.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Mark Mason,"And in terms of the CFPB late fees, well, I don't have an update on that.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Mark Mason,"Like I said, we've built in an assumption in our forecast.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Mark Mason,"But in terms of the timing, I don't have a formal update on the certainty of it.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Operator,The next question is from Ken Usdin at Jefferies.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Operator,Your line is now open.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Operator,Please go ahead.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Ken Usdin,"Hey, thanks, good morning.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Ken Usdin,"Hey, Mark.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Ken Usdin,"Talking about the NII outlook and the fact that now we've got a little bit of a discrepancy starting between US rates, maybe higher for longer, and then the beginnings of some of the non-US curve starting to, at least put fourth their first cut.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Ken Usdin,I know we've got that good chart that you have in the Qs about the relative contributions.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Ken Usdin,Can you just help us understand a little bit of like just generally how you're thinking through that discrepancy and how that informs the difference between US-related NII and non-US-related NII as you go forward?,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Mark Mason,"Yeah, thank you.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Mark Mason,"So look, I think that as we look at it, out through the certainly through the medium term, we expect to see continued NII growth at obviously a modest level, certainly lower than what we've seen historically and that's in large part because or in part I should say because of how we've been managing the balance sheet and that has allowed for us to reinvest as securities have rolled off and earn a higher yield on them relative to what we were earning, in some instances, they were five-year terms on some of these investments.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Mark Mason,And so we still think there's some upside from a reinvestment point of view.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Mark Mason,"The point you make around kind of non-US dollar or US rates kind of coming off, that'll play through a little bit as we think about the beta increases that we're expecting outside of the US.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Mark Mason,"And so, we've assumed that we have higher betas pick up outside of the US.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Mark Mason,"If rates kind of come off in a more substantive way, then we could see kind of a little less NII pressure than we're forecasting there.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Mark Mason,"But net-net, as I think about the combination of volume growth that we're expecting between loans and deposits over that medium term, the higher yield we can earn on our assets, combined with the pricing capabilities that we have across the portfolio, offsetting some of that beta, we believe we'll have continued NII growth.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Mark Mason,"As I think about what I often point to in terms of the IRE analysis and you have to remember that that is a shock to the current balance sheet and it assumes that the full curve is moving simultaneously, cross currencies.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Mark Mason,"And in that case, the 100 basis point parallel shift downward would be a negative $1.6 billion, with about $1.3 billion coming from non-US dollar.",billion,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Mark Mason,"But again, that does assume that all of those currencies come down at the same time and doesn't account for the rebalancing of the balance sheet and things that I mentioned like the reinvestment higher yields that we'd be able to earn.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Ken Usdin,Got it.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Ken Usdin,And just one follow-up on the OCC amendment and that's specifically related to the Resource Review Plan.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,Yes,occ,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Ken Usdin,Do you have a line of sight on how long that'll take you guys to finish because it seems like and is that what we should be thinking about in terms of just understanding like what the side of what you need to get done in terms of the other language that's written in the order?,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Jane Fraser,"So, Ken, look, the Resource Review Plan is just that.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Jane Fraser,It's a plan to ensure that we have sufficient resources allocated towards achieving a timely and sustainable compliance to the order.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Jane Fraser,"Essentially if an area is delayed or looking as if it could be, we'll determine what additional resourcing, if any, is required to get back on track and then we'll share that with the OCC in a more formalized way than we do today and we obviously review this pretty constantly ourselves.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,Yes,occ,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Jane Fraser,We're already working on the plan.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Jane Fraser,After it's finalized with the OCC it will be confidential supervisory information that we can't disclose.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,Yes,occ,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Jane Fraser,"So, we won't be able to tell you that the plan is, what the nature of the plan is going to be, but it won't be much more complicated than what we talked about.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Jane Fraser,"And we're expecting to get it, we're not expecting this to take long.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Operator,The next question is from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Operator,Your line is now open.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Operator,Please go ahead.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Betsy Graseck,"So, I know we talked a lot about expenses.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Betsy Graseck,"I just have one kind of overarching question here, which is on how we should think about the path of expenses between now and the medium term, as we have come quite a long way in the simplification process.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Betsy Graseck,Maybe if you could give us a sense as to how far along simplification impact on expenses we are?,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Betsy Graseck,"And overlapping with the regulatory requirements, do these net out or are we skewed a little bit more towards regulatory requirements being a bit heavier than what's left on simplification from here?",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Mark Mason,"So, thank you, Betsy.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Mark Mason,I guess I'd say a couple things.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Mark Mason,"So, I think we said it in the past.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Mark Mason,"So, the target for the medium term, we think 2026 is somewhere around $51 billion to $53 billion of expenses.",billion,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Mark Mason,"As we've said, we'll have about $1.5 billion in savings related to the restructuring that we've done and another $500 million to $1 billion related to net expense reductions from eliminating the stranded costs as well as additional productivity over that medium-term period.","billion, million",yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Mark Mason,"And so, we've made, I think, very good headway, as Jane has mentioned, in the org simplification and the restructuring charges associated with that.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Mark Mason,Those saves will have started to generate.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Mark Mason,"Some of those saves in the early part of that, meaning this year, will likely be offset by continued investment that we're making in areas of the business like transformation, but also in business-led or driven growth.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Mark Mason,And you should expect in terms of the trend that we would have a downward trend towards 2026 in achieving that range.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Jane Fraser,"And I just want to reiterate, we remain confident that we will meet our 11% to 12% RoTCE target over the medium term.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Jane Fraser,"And we've got the, we have the ability to manage the different elements we've been talking about today, making sure that we're investing sufficient resources into the transformation so we can be on track with that, as well as in our businesses, as well as the return of capital to our shareholders.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Jane Fraser,"So, we feel confident around that and good about it, we can manage this.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Mark Mason,"Yeah, I think that's a great point, Jane.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Mark Mason,"Look, the reality is, as was pointed out earlier, we spent about $3 billion last year, a little bit under that, on the transformation-related work.",billion,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Mark Mason,And the plan has called for us to spend a little bit more than that this year.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Mark Mason,"And frankly, in the first half of the year, as we work through the transformation work and some of the things that Jane and I have mentioned earlier in the year that we've been focused on, like data and data related to regulatory reporting, we've had to spend more than we had planned for in the first half, right, and we've done that and we funded that.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Mark Mason,We've been able to find productivity opportunities that allow for us to still stay within the guidance that we've given for the full year.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Mark Mason,"So, we are managing this entire expense base, right, so not the whole $53 billion plus of it, we are actively managing that with an eye towards what's required from a transformation point of view to keep it on track, to accelerate in areas where we're behind and to shore up areas where we're tracking in accordance to what the order requires and where are the other inefficiencies that can allow for us to free up the expense base?",billion,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Mark Mason,"And so, things like the work that Andy Sieg has done with the finance team around that expense base and finding efficiencies there are opportunities that we've been able to tease out of the business.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Mark Mason,"Things that we have done in parts of USPB and that we have continued to get after in parts of Banking, which you see in the down 10% this quarter are areas where we've been keenly focused on, where are there duplicative roles, where are there inefficient processes that we can actually drive greater efficiency out of.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Mark Mason,"So, longwinded way of saying, we understand the expense guidance that we've given, we also understand and stress the importance of funding the transformation with what's required and we're doing both.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Betsy Graseck,Great.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Operator,The next question is from Vivek Juneja with JPMorgan.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Operator,Your line is now open.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Operator,Please go ahead.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Vivek Juneja,"Let me just clarify this, Mark and Jane, just to make sure that we all have it right.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Vivek Juneja,"The $53.5 billion to $53.8 billion does not include anything thus far on what you think you may need to spend on the Resource Review Plan, meaning what additional resources you would have to put to fix the consent order.",billion,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Vivek Juneja,Am I right there?,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Jane Fraser,"So, I think as you've heard us talk about, Vivek, for a while now, that we knew the areas that we were behind in elements of our transformation program and that we began addressing those and making the investments.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Jane Fraser,Some of that's in people.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Jane Fraser,Some of that is in technology spend.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Jane Fraser,It's using different tools and capabilities to get areas addressed earlier and we began that earlier in the year and you saw that acknowledged as well by our regulators who pointed to the fact that we've already begun addressing the areas that we're behind.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Jane Fraser,Mark?,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Mark Mason,"That's right, Jane, and what you have heard is that despite having to spend more, some $250 million or so more, we're not changing the guidance, right.",million,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Mark Mason,"And so, we have, as Jane mentioned, we have worked on areas already that we've needed to and we have looked for ways to absorb that and are doing so within our guidance.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Vivek Juneja,"So, going forward, even though this plan is still to be sort of put together and approved by the regulators, we should not expect any change to this expense guidance?",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Mark Mason,"Look, the plan, the Resource Review Plan, as Jane mentioned, is what we're working through now with the regulators.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Mark Mason,That will be a process for demonstrating to them that we are spending and allocating the appropriate resources to accomplishing the commitments that we have.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Mark Mason,Appropriate resources can range from people to technology to enhancing our processes and ensuring better execution.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Mark Mason,"If you think about what that will entail, it will entail areas where we are delayed or behind as we identify those areas, being able to tease out the root cause of any delay and ensure that we've got proper funding allocated to get it back on track and that's me framing out how I think about what something like this might look like.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Mark Mason,"And so, what we're saying is that if we identify issues in the quarters to come, that we haven't identified already, that's the process we're going to apply to those issues.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Mark Mason,"And as you've heard us say repeatedly, we're going to spend whatever is necessary to then get those things back on track.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Mark Mason,"And as we've done thus far this year, we're going to look for opportunities to absorb those headwinds.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Mark Mason,I hope that's clear.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Operator,The next question is from Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Operator,Your line is now open.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Operator,Please go ahead.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Operator,: Hi.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Operator,"Apologies if I missed it in the opening remarks, but what drove the decline in credit card revenues from 1Q to 2Q?",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Operator,"Looks like they were down about 6% in aggregate even though average loans went up, spending went up.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Operator,What was the driver of that?,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Mark Mason,"Credit card revenues, seasonality.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Jane Fraser,"Yeah, seasonality.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Mark Mason,Seasonality playing through there sequentially.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Mark Mason,Yeah.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Jane Fraser,"I think if you look year-over-year, you'll be able to see a pretty common trend there.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Jane Fraser,"The consumer is slowing in some of the, in the spend, as Mark had referred to, Matt.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Jane Fraser,And a lot of the spending and the growth areas we are seeing and underlying numbers is being driven by the affluent customer.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Mark Mason,Yeah.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Mark Mason,"I think there's also the dynamic on the CRS of the reward or across the portfolio of rewards playing through from one quarter to the other, so the combination of those things are playing through the revenue line there.",revenue,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Jane Fraser,"But nothing that's particularly worrying us, Matt.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Jane Fraser,: Okay.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Jane Fraser,"And then just separately on the very early kind of part of the prepared remarks, you talked about the dividends being capped in terms of what could be upstream from the bank to the holding company because of the OCC that came out this week.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,Yes,occ,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Jane Fraser,"For all intents and purposes, like does that impact how you run the company or subsidiary or impact liquidity or capital?",liquidity,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Jane Fraser,"I understood the comment, no change to dividends or buybacks at the holding company, but is there any impact from that that we would notice on the outside?",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Jane Fraser,"Look, let's be clear, this action does not impact our ability to return capital to our shareholders.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Jane Fraser,The dividends that are referenced are just intercompany payments from CBNA to the parent.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Jane Fraser,"So, first of all, don't confuse what a dividend is here.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Jane Fraser,"We will, it's not going to impact how we run the company, the subsidiary, the capital, the liquidity at all and the dividends are not capped.",liquidity,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Mark Mason,"Yeah, I think, Jane, that's right.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Mark Mason,"And I think let's not lose sight of the purpose of the orders that are there and the purpose of the orders that are there are to ensure that we're funding and allocating the effort appropriately, right.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Mark Mason,"So, the regulators want essentially the same thing we want, right, is for us to get this done, right, and so that is the primary objective.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Mark Mason,The reference to the dividending from out of CBNA up to the parent is certainly referenced there between now and establishing that Resource Review Plan.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Mark Mason,"But as Jane mentions, that does not constrain the parent from doing the things that it will need to do.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Mark Mason,"And as opposed to, it's not a cap.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Mark Mason,"What it is, is that anything above the debt service of the parent or the preferred dividends and other nondiscretionary obligations would require a non-objection from the OCC.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,Yes,occ,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Jane Fraser,"Until the Resource Plan is agreed and as you'll have seen, the Resource Plan needs to be submitted within 30 days, and as I indicated, we're working on that one and not anticipating that to be a problem.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Operator,The next question is from Saul Martinez with HSBC.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Operator,Your line is now open.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Operator,Please go ahead.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Saul Martinez,"Just, I guess I just want to follow up on the latter question.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Saul Martinez,I just want to be very clear.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Saul Martinez,"So, what you're saying is that the requirement that CBNA receive a non-objection before dividending upstream to the parent, that does not impact how you think about your capital flexibility, how you think about it doesn't restrict you in any way and shouldn't impact, for example, your ability to benefit from, for example, a Basel Endgame rule that is softened or some of the benefits, Mark, that you talked about in terms of simplification.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Saul Martinez,"So, you don't see this impacting your ongoing level of capital flexibility and your ability to repurchase stock going forward if some of these things actually do play out?",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Saul Martinez,You don't?,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Saul Martinez,Right.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Mark Mason,Right.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Saul Martinez,Fair enough.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Saul Martinez,That was as clear as can be.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Saul Martinez,"Second question on, I just want to follow up on USPB.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Saul Martinez,I still I get the point that you're seeing a normalization in losses in Cards.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Saul Martinez,"But even if I adjust for reserve builds, your RoTCE is still single digits.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Saul Martinez,"I would think even at these NCL levels, your Cards business is pretty profitable.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Saul Martinez,"You're a scale player, you're above sort of pre-pandemic levels, but not I don't know if I, it doesn't seem like it's that much higher by a dramatic amount.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Saul Martinez,"It would seem to imply that the Retail Bank is a huge drag on profitability, even maybe even losing money, I don't know.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Saul Martinez,But can you just talk about what you can do to sort of improve the Retail Bank profitability and just give anymore color that you can in terms of the path to get to that high-teen RoTCE you talked about?,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Jane Fraser,"Yeah, let me kick off there, and let's say, look, clearly, we're very focused on improving the returns in USPB to get us to the high-teens level over the medium term and you've seen us generating healthy positive operating leverage this quarter.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Jane Fraser,We've had a number of quarters of good revenue growth.,revenue,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Jane Fraser,"And as Mark said, we're at the low point of the credit cycle and we knew this year, we would see the pressure on returns from the elevated NCLs and some of the industry headwinds we've talked about.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Jane Fraser,"But as the NCL rates approach steady state levels and the mitigating actions that all of us have been putting in place against the industry headwinds, as those take hold, we expect the returns will improve and support the firm-wide medium-term targets.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Jane Fraser,"In the Retail Bank, we're continuing to focus on growing share in our six core markets and we're doing that, leveraging our physical and digital assets.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Jane Fraser,It plays an important role in enabling the wealth continuum and the growth that we're looking at in our Wealth franchise.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Jane Fraser,"We're continuing to improve our operating efficiency, being very disciplined in expense management and managing carefully the branch and digital productivity of the Retail Bank network.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Jane Fraser,But we're at the high point of the credit cycle.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Jane Fraser,"It's driving the low point for USPB, and as I said in my remarks, we're expecting to see those returns improve from here.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Operator,The next question is from Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Operator,Your line is now open.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Operator,Please go ahead.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Steven Chubak,"So, Mark, I have a fairly technical question on DTA utilization and specifically the NOLs.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Steven Chubak,The deduction is still fairly significant at $12 billion.,billion,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Steven Chubak,It roughly equates to about 10% of your market cap.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Steven Chubak,"And the good news here, I suppose, is that it should come back into capital over time, but we've seen very little utilization over the past two years despite the firm being profitable.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Steven Chubak,"And so wanted to better understand this, what's constraining your ability to utilize those DTAs and are there catalysts on the horizon that could help accelerate that utilization beyond organic earnings generation?",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Mark Mason,"So, I'm going to give you a very simple answer to a very complicated question.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Mark Mason,"It really comes down to driving US income, right.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Mark Mason,"And so, we are focused on not just all of the things that we've mentioned, but driving higher income in the US.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Mark Mason,That allows for us to utilize the disallowed DTA.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Mark Mason,"We saw some of that in the quarter and we expect to see more of it as we move through the medium term, but that is the major driver of that utilization.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Jane Fraser,And we have many of our business heads very much focused around that opportunity as well.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Jane Fraser,"So, winning in the US is a very important leg, for example, of the strategy that Vis is refreshing.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Jane Fraser,"Similarly, we see opportunities from the Commercial Bank.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Jane Fraser,We see it in Wealth.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Jane Fraser,"We see it in, obviously in US Personal Banking and in Services.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Jane Fraser,"So, we're very, we're focused from a business strategy point of view on this, not just from the financial side.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Steven Chubak,"Thank you, both, for that color.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Steven Chubak,Maybe just a quick follow-up just on the Retail Services business.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Steven Chubak,We are seeing some evidence that your competitors in this space have been more aggressive leading with price in an effort to win some new mandates.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Steven Chubak,And was hoping you could just speak to what you're seeing across the competitor set and your appetite or willingness to potentially offer better economics in response to increased competition from some of your peers.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Jane Fraser,I think you'll be delighted to hear that we're very focused on returns rather than just on revenues.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Jane Fraser,"So, when we enter into discussions with a partner who may be a new RFP for their portfolio or looking at new ones such as the one we just agreed with Dillard's, it's all about the returns and the profile of the business rather than the revenue side of things.",revenue,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Jane Fraser,"And it's a shift probably from some other ways in the past, but I'm very pleased with how disciplined the team is being around this and we're seeing the benefits of it.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Mark Mason,Yeah.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Mark Mason,And that may be different from what you hear and see from other players in the space.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Mark Mason,"But as Jane mentioned, we're keenly focused on ensuring that, yes, we have a good partnership, but that we're generating an appropriate return.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Mark Mason,That's part of achieving our medium-term targets.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Mark Mason,"And as you know, since you brought up Retail cards, I mean, when we think about how CECL works and the reserves you have to establish for these partnerships, we're establishing full, lifetime reserves that's on the balance sheet where ultimately we end up splitting those through the partner sharing economics.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Mark Mason,"So, it's another important consideration as we think about expanding and taking on these relationships and renegotiating partnerships to making sure that returns make good sense for us.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Jane Fraser,Yeah.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Jane Fraser,And Mark and I have no problem saying no to revenue that doesn't come at the right returns and being very disciplined around that.,revenue,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q2,Operator,The next question is from Vivek Juneja with JPMorgan.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,

2021,Q3,Jane Fraser,"So as we look at all of this, I would say, clearly, there's a trend towards multiple different formats of how a customer can and wants to pay, and we're really on the front foot of this and making some strong progress on the back of the investments that we've been making over the last few years, and we'll continue to do so.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q3,Operator,Your next question will come from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,

2021,Q3,Betsy Graseck,"I know we just spoke a little bit about some of the things that you have been executing on, but when I look at the card business, while it's up on a year-on-year basis, it is trending a bit below some of the peers in terms of growth rates.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q3,Betsy Graseck,"And then you've got the retail partner card program which has some opportunities there to, in my opinion, get a little bit of a refresh to be as dynamic as some of your best-in class peers.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q3,Betsy Graseck,So wondering how you're thinking about that.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,

2021,Q3,Betsy Graseck,Because it seems like you've got a great app and it's just under-penetrating your opportunity set with your brand.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q3,Mark Mason,"Betsy, why don't I get started and Jane may want to jump in.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,

2021,Q3,Mark Mason,And we've got to see how stimulus and liquidity plays out over time.,liquidity,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q3,Mark Mason,"And so, what we're focused on is how we're re-entering into the market.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q3,Mark Mason,"And we're doing that both through our Custom Cash launch, which is helping to drive new acquisitions.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,

2021,Q3,Mark Mason,We're being thoughtful about that.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q3,Mark Mason,"So over the last five years, we've been shortening our promotional periods and adding higher fees for balance transfers and targeting a lower mix of promotional balances.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q3,Mark Mason,"And those things, as you know, will feed future average interest earning balances, as our experience is that roughly half of those balances ultimately convert to revolving over time.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q3,Mark Mason,"So, that's an important step.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,

2021,Q3,Mark Mason,And we're driving growth on card lending products like Flex Pay and Flex Loan.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q3,Mark Mason,"And those don't have promotional periods associated with them, and they start to generate interest from day one.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q3,Mark Mason,"And so, we're keenly focused on this.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,

2021,Q3,Mark Mason,It's obviously an important part of our portfolio and generates healthy returns.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q3,Mark Mason,"But we need to be positioned to capture growth as the economy continues to recover and behavior normalizes, and we need to be prepared if behavior doesn't normalize as quickly as we'd like with things like broader lending products.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,

2021,Q3,Jim Mitchell,How do we think about your rate sensitivity to the rest of the world?,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,

2021,Q3,Mark Mason,"As you look at kind of our IRE that we report, we're not that sensitive to the short end or long end.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q3,Mark Mason,"But that said, rate increases are beneficial for us.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q3,Mark Mason,"And so, we are – we've got a lot of liquidity that's available for us to invest as we see rates increase but, also, have enough dry powder to ensure that we're taking advantage of client demand as that starts to return as well.",liquidity,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q3,Mark Mason,"But for our firm, as you pointed out, the global impact to rates is quite important and increases internationally help to fuel our performance in parts of the franchise like TTS and elsewhere.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,

2021,Q3,Ken Usdin,"And I know probably too early to talk about next year, but can you just help us understand just the moving parts underneath incentive comp transformation and what we should be thinking about in terms of just run rate costs from here.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q3,Ken Usdin,If we can even stay away from just kind of like what next year growth looks like.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,

2021,Q3,Mark Mason,"Yeah, sure.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q3,Mark Mason,"So, look, let me start by saying, as I pointed out in prepared remarks, our expenses in aggregate are on guidance, so to speak, both as it relates to the transformation expected spend which year-to-date is up 3%, as well as our total expenses which are up 5% year-to-date, again consistent with the guidance.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q3,Mark Mason,"As I think about this, those are two very important categories of spend.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,

2021,Q3,Mark Mason,"So, we are very deliberate about the spend that you're seeing.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q3,Mark Mason,"And in fact, I'm scrubbing, we are scrubbing every single expense line that we have, right, to ensure that the dollars that we're putting to work are being put to work in an optimal fashion, that they're necessary dollars to be spent.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q3,Mark Mason,"And in doing that, we're also looking for productivity and efficiency opportunities.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,

2021,Q3,Jane Fraser,So the compensation of the management team is designed to be performance based.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q3,Jane Fraser,It's aligned with the interest of our shareholders most importantly.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,

2021,Q3,Jane Fraser,The board and I hold the senior leaders driving that transformation accountable for its successful execution.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q3,Jane Fraser,I'm certainly driving this program with urgency.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,

2021,Q3,Jane Fraser,And we need to do this so that we can hit the milestones and to deliver with excellence.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,

2021,Q3,Jane Fraser,So you'll see them.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,

2021,Q3,Jane Fraser,"As I – obviously, as I said in the opening, we were disappointed in their decision.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,

2021,Q3,Jane Fraser,"And what I am pleased is the strength of the digital engagement that we are seeing across the US, it's lagged other geographies around the world across the industry on this dimension, and also the growth in sticky digital deposits that we're seeing in the US.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,

2021,Q3,Mike Mayo,"So what can you do from a symbolic nature, like, everyone gets paid in stock?",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,

2021,Q3,Mike Mayo,"And then, since you're only giving one question at a time, just a little bit more follow-up on your US consumer strategy as far as digital deposits, cross-selling to credit cards, point of sale with Amazon, a little bit more on that.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q3,Jane Fraser,"Mike, it's Jane, let – obviously.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,

2021,Q3,Jane Fraser,"Unequivocally, our shareholders are incredibly important to us.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q3,Jane Fraser,"And when we look at where we're trading and the underperformance around that, it is something that we are determined in the strategy refresh, in the transformation work we're doing, and in the culture and talent work we're doing to address this.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q3,Jane Fraser,We're going to do what is necessary to narrow the gap with our peers.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q3,Jane Fraser,"We're going to ensure we have the right business mix and strategies to drive up the returns, and you're starting to see where that is – where we're headed to with that from the different decisions we've already announced.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q3,Jane Fraser,"And obviously, it will all come together on Investor Day.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q3,Jane Fraser,"But secondly, we're also going to do it by running the bank better.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q3,Jane Fraser,And we've laid out on page 3 of the presentation what are the different priorities so that our investors realize the value that we think lies in Citi and what we are going to be doing to unlock that for their benefit.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q3,Jane Fraser,And I think it – I hope it's pretty clear in terms of the framework that we're using and the principles around that.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q3,Jane Fraser,"And in terms of, as Mark said, from a – not only unlocking the value that we see in Citi, which I really do think is pretty tremendous and I'm quite excited about, it's also then what will we do with our excess capital.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q3,Jane Fraser,"You've heard me say, given where we trade, so disappointingly below book, obviously, share repurchases make sense for our shareholders.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q3,Jane Fraser,"We also do have a healthy dividend yield, but that's an important part of the mix.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q3,Jane Fraser,But there's no question around the attractiveness for shareholder relatively of the stock buybacks.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q3,Jane Fraser,And we will certainly be returning excess capital to our shareholders and be very mindful of the bar that is required for investment internally.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q3,Jane Fraser,"And you've seen that with the decisions that we've made on the exits in Asia on consumer and some of the other moves, that we will exit the businesses we think are lower returning and reinvest where appropriate.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q3,Jane Fraser,But we'll return that to shareholders.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q3,Jane Fraser,And I can see my CFO is champing at the bit here to jump in as well.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q3,Mark Mason,Yeah.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q3,Mark Mason,"And I just – I think you answered it very well, I'll just add a couple of quick things.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q3,Mark Mason,"One, that when we invest in the business towards clients or more broadly in the business, we're doing it where returns are above our cost of capital.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q3,Mark Mason,So we're making smart decisions about how to redeploy that capital to ensure that we're narrowing that gap to peers.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q3,Mark Mason,"The second thing I'd point out is that in the first couple of quarters of the year, we've maxed out the capital return that was available for us to deliver before the SCB came into play, and that is because our shareholders are so important.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q3,Mark Mason,"And then the third, as Jane mentioned, is that we have a skew towards buybacks, again, just given where the stock is trading and given where our dividend yield is.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q3,Mark Mason,So thank you for the question.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,

2021,Q3,Steven Chubak,You have a large – many large peers have been investing heavily in this space for years.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q3,Steven Chubak,"And I know you're going to cover some of this at Investor Day and provide more detail, but just at a high level, I was hoping you could speak to what differentiates Citi's value prop from some of the peers in the space, whether you have the technology or infrastructure in place to support some of your growth ambitions.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q3,Steven Chubak,"And then just lastly, whether you can engage in M&A or is that precluded under the consent order if you were to look to expand into that arena inorganically.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q3,Jane Fraser,Yeah.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,

2021,Q3,Jane Fraser,"We've also got real breadth of client relationships, and this is where the connectivity points also become important in those four principles that we laid out for the strategy refresh.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q3,Jane Fraser,We have commercial banking operations in 30 geographies around the world that have been operating for many years now.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,

2021,Q3,Jane Fraser,so the synergies that we will be able to generate by much more closely connecting them will be very important.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q3,Jane Fraser,"Similarly, the elevator from the affluent client base in our consumer franchise, all the way up to the ultra-high net worth in the Private Bank is obviously a natural area to build out that we haven't really invested in that elevator and thinking of it that way.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q3,Jane Fraser,We have a great – we have some great platforms.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q3,Jane Fraser,"Our Institutional Clients business around the world means that we've got top two platforms for our private banking clients, in particular, to take advantage of, but it's also ones that our consumer clients have as well.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q3,Jane Fraser,So the opportunity here is to bring all these different pieces together into a single integrated offering across the full spectrum of clients in the US and in the global offshore wealth centers.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q3,Jane Fraser,And I would also point the fact that we're already the top three player in Asia.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q3,Jane Fraser,It's not as if we don't have scale and that this is a start-up business here.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q3,Jane Fraser,And we're already seeing that this is coming into fruition quickly.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q3,Jane Fraser,We obviously announced the focus on Wealth at the beginning of the year.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,

2021,Q3,Jane Fraser,"We've done one of the biggest tech releases for Wealth in the third quarter of this year, with over 70-plus features going live on the back of the digital platform we launched last quarter.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q3,Jane Fraser,"So, I think the fact that we've got all these different pieces, we're putting them all together, is really giving us momentum and accelerating the opportunity for us.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q3,Jane Fraser,And this is a trend.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,

2021,Q3,Jane Fraser,"Obviously, it's more focused around what are digital capabilities, what are other things to enhance the value propositions and the technological side.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q3,Jane Fraser,"And those aren't just acquisitions, it's partnerships and the like that we've been investing in so that we really serve the wealthy clients across the full spectrum of their needs rather than just narrowly as some of the other players are in just the sort of investment products.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q3,Jane Fraser,We've got the benefit across the board.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,

2022,Q3,Mark Mason,"Excluding these items, revenues were down about 12% largely due to the loss of revenues from the Australia and Philippines closing as well as the impact of the Korea wind down.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Mark Mason,"Expenses increased 6%, driven by divestiture impacts in Asia and Mexico.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,

2022,Q3,Mark Mason,"On Slide 16, I'll briefly touch on our full year 2022 outlook.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Mark Mason,"With one quarter remaining in the year, we continue to expect full year revenues to be up in the low single-digit range, excluding divestiture-related impacts.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,

2022,Q3,Mark Mason,"Clearly, where we land within that range will be a function of a number of factors, including rates, loans and deposit volumes, deposit betas and currency impacts.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,

2022,Q3,Mark Mason,"In terms of cost of credit, it will be a function of the evolution of the macro environment, normalization that we continue to expect in the cards businesses and loan growth.",loan growth,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Mark Mason,And keep in mind that loan growth tends to be higher in the fourth quarter versus the third given typical holiday spending.,loan growth,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,

2022,Q3,"Question And Answer
Operator",Our first question will come from Glenn Schorr with Evercore.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Glenn Schorr,"So definitely a good performance out of TTS, rates helped a ton, but I see loan growth and fees, and I heard your comments about growth across all client segments.",loan growth,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Glenn Schorr,I wonder if we could pull back the onion a drop and talk about those two in separate pieces.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Glenn Schorr,"One is 61% year-on-year NII, how do betas factor in and go forward over the next year in terms of higher rates and how that factors through?",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Glenn Schorr,"And then two, what specifically is growing within TTS across those client segments to drive that high single digit growth?",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Mark Mason,"Glenn, why don't I take that and kind of take it in the 2 pieces that you laid out.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Mark Mason,"So as you know, Glenn, when we think about our business just in aggregate, there's obviously a split between the institutional and the consumer side.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Mark Mason,"Our TTS business, which is on the Institutional side, and these corporate clients, they tend to have higher betas in general than obviously, the Retail Banking side.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Mark Mason,What we've seen is that the betas have been increasing.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Mark Mason,They are still running lower than what we had expected.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Mark Mason,"But again, they have been increasing.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Mark Mason,"And with continued expected rate increases, I would expect that those betas will continue to rise in the coming quarters.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Mark Mason,We have been actively managing deposit pricing and repricing with our clients on an ongoing basis.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Mark Mason,You know that this is more than just a deposit-taking business.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Mark Mason,This is a business where we are looking to manage the operating accounts of our clients and bring the breadth of what we offer in our franchise to them.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Mark Mason,"And so that's the type of conversation we've been having with them, and we'll continue to do that with an eye towards growing the volume of deposits with both the existing as well as with new clients.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Mark Mason,"And so we, again, expect to see betas rise but also expect to see continued contribution to the NII.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Mark Mason,The other aspect of your question is what else has been driving the activity.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Mark Mason,I mentioned a couple of those things.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Mark Mason,"So it's not just deepening with existing clients, but it's also onboarding new clients.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Mark Mason,We've seen cross-border transaction value up about 10%.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Mark Mason,The commercial card spend is up meaningfully.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Mark Mason,Trade originations are up 27%.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,

2022,Q3,Mark Mason,We've been winning new mandates.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Mark Mason,"We've seen an uptick in client wins, up about 20%, and we've been gaining share across those client segments.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Mark Mason,"And so hopefully, that gives you a little bit of examples of where the benefits or momentum is coming from on the NIR side.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Mark Mason,"The NIR growth of 8% is driven really by the cards, the payments and receivables as well as trade.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Jane Fraser,"And I'd just jump in and say, I think there's a bit of a miss at the moment that the global environment is detrimental to activity.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Jane Fraser,We see quite the opposite.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Jane Fraser,"Volatility is something in which we're very active in helping our multinational clients around the world manage the local footprint we have and the global network we have is a tremendous asset right now, so we're seeing a lot of positive momentum, which may not always be intuitive to everyone, but I think it's what makes the network, the crown jewel of Citi.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Glenn Schorr,I appreciate all that.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Glenn Schorr,A quick one on Markets.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Glenn Schorr,"Not quite as good as peers, but that comes and goes, I know that's a function of last year was really strong.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Glenn Schorr,It's a function of mix in any given quarter.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Glenn Schorr,"What I really want to focus on is your comments on RWA optimization, what specifically are you doing?",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Glenn Schorr,"I know it's the banking book, but I did see you taking down your capital, call it redemption facility line.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Glenn Schorr,"But in markets, what are you pulling back on RWA, just which pieces of that business?",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Glenn Schorr,I’d find that interesting.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Mark Mason,"So Glenn, you'll remember at Investor Day, we talked not only about RWA optimization broadly, but specifically as it relates to Markets.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Mark Mason,And we talked about the idea of increasing our revenue to RWA ratio for markets to about 5.5% over the course of that Investor Day period.,revenue,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Mark Mason,"So we've been actively working across the Markets business in equities, in fixed income and spread products and looking for opportunities where there are low returning uses of RWA to either increase the returns on that or to actually kind of exit it.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Mark Mason,And that includes a host of different structures.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Mark Mason,"It includes working with clients to post additional collateral in some instances and other types of structures like that, that improved the RWA, including hedging and like I said, posting collateral and taking a look at margin that we have and ensuring that we are, in fact, getting the most for that use of RWA.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Operator,Our next question will come from John McDonald with Autonomous Research.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Operator,JOHN Mc,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Donald,"Mark, I wanted to just clarify what I think the expense guide is for fourth quarter.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Donald,It seems like the guidance for the full year implies a fourth quarter step-up to maybe $12.8B and change from $12.75B this quarter.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Donald,"Is that the right read, a little bit of a step-up in the fourth quarter?",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Donald,And is that just a pull-through of investments?,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Donald,And what would be driving that?,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Mark Mason,"So again, the guidance on full year expenses hasn't changed.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Mark Mason,It's the 7% to 8% ex the impact of divestitures that would imply a bit of an uptick there.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Mark Mason,It is on the heels of the continued investments that we're making and that's flowing through as well as how revenues kind of play out and the associated compensation activity that goes along with that.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Mark Mason,So nothing extraordinary and consistent with the guidance given.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Mark Mason,JOHN Mc,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Donald,And I know it's too early to give formal guidance for next year.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Donald,"But if we look at the Investor Day slides, it seems to imply that expenses go up for a few years until you get to the medium term.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Donald,Is that the right read?,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Donald,"And when I annualize where you'll be exiting the fourth quarter here, implies that at $51 billion or so next year as a starting point.",billion,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Donald,I mean is it fair when I read the Investor Day slides and think about your investments that directionally expenses probably do go up next year?,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Mark Mason,"John, I'd say, as you know, right, we'll give guidance for 2023 next quarter.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Mark Mason,"But I think if you think back to the Investor Day and you think about some of the things that, that we just commented on with regard to our services business, we'd expect to see continued tailwinds as it relates to net interest income.",net interest income,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Mark Mason,"We would expect to get to the heart of your question that we will continue to invest in the franchise in the transformation, that would obviously peak and then we would start to see the benefits start to play out from that in that medium-term period.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Mark Mason,"And so yes, you can probably expect some type of a tick up, but I'll give you more details on that when we talk about the '23 outlook in the next quarter.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Operator,Our next question will come from Erika Najarian with UBS.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Erika Najarian,I just wanted to take a step back.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Erika Najarian,"Your 11% to 12% medium-term RoTCE target had contemplated an 11.5% to 12% CET1 versus the 13% that you're targeting to by midyear next year, also that you laid out on that same slide that you're targeting 2% Fed funds over the medium term, which seems kind of cute right now.",cet1,no,Yes,cet1,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Erika Najarian,"So I guess I'm wondering, your confidence and you said you're confident you could hit medium-term targets even with this creep in capital.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Erika Najarian,Is it really that shift in the rate environment that's helping you get there despite the higher denominator?,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Mark Mason,So thank you for the question.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Mark Mason,"Look, I think there are a couple of things to kind of think back on that still hold true, which is the strategy that we've built, I think, is a resilient strategy and it really spoke to top line momentum that we expected not just through rate increases, but also through share gains and also through the business-led investments that we're making and better leveraging the synergies and linkages across the franchise.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Mark Mason,All of those things still hold true to the top line.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Mark Mason,"You're right, the Fed funds assumption has changed.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Mark Mason,"Back in March, I think we all were looking at a Fed funds rate at the end of the year that was closer to 1.5% or so.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Mark Mason,And so now here we are with the hikes that we've seen and looking at something certainly north of 4% or 4.5%.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Mark Mason,And so that's changed meaningfully.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Mark Mason,But there are a number of other drivers that contribute to achieving that return.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Mark Mason,"It's the medium term, so call it 3 to 5 years, I think, is how we characterized it and starting to see some of the benefits from the transformation investments that we're making.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Mark Mason,"To your point on capital, we are building to the 13%.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Mark Mason,"Remember, that is a by-product of a 4% SCB for this particular CCAR cycle and the strategy that we described includes a mix in our shift of revenues and earnings over time, a mix towards more stable PPNR and more fee revenues that will contribute to, I think, a balance sheet and a mix that generates fewer losses, stress losses, than our balance sheet might today.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,Yes,ccar,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Mark Mason,"So the contribution of those things, we think, will drive that return target that we've set, and we still remain confident about that.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Mark Mason,"Now with that said, there are unknowns that are out there.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Mark Mason,I just spoke to many of the knowns.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Mark Mason,"And so what happens with further capital requirements and the current regulatory regime and what have you, it's hard to predict.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Mark Mason,But we'll manage to that as we learn and know more about it.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Erika Najarian,Got it.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Erika Najarian,"And my follow-up question is given Citi's valuation on book, I think your current and prospective shareholders are waiting for buybacks to potentially return.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Erika Najarian,I guess a two-part question here.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Erika Najarian,"Number one, especially if you think you think you could stabilize your PPNR in the stress test, why 100 basis point management buffer versus one of your peers at 50 that reported today?",,no,No,,No,,No,,Yes,stress test,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Erika Najarian,"And secondarily, as we think about the return of buybacks, I imagine that once you hit that 13%, the buybacks could return.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Erika Najarian,"But how does the Banamex sale potentially impact the timing, as I recall, there's a currency translation adjustment that could be negative upfront at announcement to CET1, but you get that all back during close.",cet1,no,Yes,cet1,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Erika Najarian,"So I guess the real big question here is how should we think about, what are the mile markers for the return of buyback activity at Citi?",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Mark Mason,"There's a lot there to unpack, so if I forget anything, just please remind me.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Mark Mason,"But I'll start at the beginning, which is I know where we trade in terms of book value.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Mark Mason,And I'd love to be in a position where we were buying back given that valuation.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Mark Mason,"With that said, we're going to take it quarter by quarter, as I think you've heard us say and evaluate what buyback decisions and capital actions make the most sense in light of the environment that we're managing through, we're clearly managing through an uncertain environment.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Mark Mason,"As I just said and as you kind of mentioned as well, we do see our business mix shifting over time on the heels of our strategy.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Mark Mason,"I do think that over time, that will contribute, as I said, to the capital requirements that we have, but that's over the medium term.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Mark Mason,And we do still see a fair amount of volatility in the stress capital buffer.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Mark Mason,"And part of the reason that we have the management buffer is to deal not only with that uncertainty in the SCB, but also in interest rates.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Mark Mason,"And we're seeing volatility in both, frankly.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Mark Mason,And so we'll continue to evaluate the management buffer as well to see what makes sense as we move towards that medium term.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Mark Mason,"In terms of the Mexico transaction, you're right in terms of we have mentioned before, the CTA component to that.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Mark Mason,That is a timing difference.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Mark Mason,We have factored that in to the path to our 13% by middle of next year and factor that into achieving the longer term targets that we set for ourselves.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Operator,Our next question will come from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Mike Mayo,"Look, I look at the global network as a curse and a blessing.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Mike Mayo,I guess the curse part is simply the complexity and the expenses.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Mike Mayo,"And Mark, you said expenses should go up higher next year.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Mike Mayo,"You're not going to tell us for a few more months, but I'm just wondering when you think you can grow revenues faster than expenses.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Mike Mayo,"Again it's not new news, the revenues and expenses.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Mike Mayo,You guided it and you're within that range.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Mike Mayo,It’s just do we have to wait a year or 3 years or how long for that complexity to get more simplified so revenues can catch up to that expense growth?,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Mike Mayo,"And then on the blessing side, Mark, you mentioned, you said gain share in those clients segments, I thought that was little vague.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Mike Mayo,"I mean you talked about trade, you talked about other activities connecting multinational corporations in the spirit of volatility, so if you could a little more meat on the bone as far when you talk about market share and those tailwinds on the revenues while you have the headwinds on the expenses from the global network.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Jane Fraser,"Hey, Mike, it's Jane, jumping in because I do want to talk a bit about your point on the global network here.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Jane Fraser,"I have to tell you, I'm hard pressed to find a negative to the global network.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Jane Fraser,We start off with the vision for the bank that we laid out in March.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Jane Fraser,It is to be the preeminent banking partner for clients with cross border needs.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Jane Fraser,Who are those clients?,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Jane Fraser,"It is 5,000 multinationals and their subsidiaries, it's institutional investors and the ultra-high net worth clients with a heavy tilt to family offices.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Jane Fraser,"And we serve them on FX, on liquidity management, on their payroll, on their supply chain as well as strategic advice, financing, et cetera.",liquidity,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Jane Fraser,"That's $4 trillion in daily volume, 80% of that credit portfolio is investment grade.",trillion,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Jane Fraser,"So when we're looking at it, it's the multinationals.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Jane Fraser,"To take a higher risk country, the client base we're serving there are the global multinationals much more than the local players.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Jane Fraser,"And so this is a relatively simple, high returning, very well growing as we're seeing at the moment, capability that is exceedingly hard to replicate.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Jane Fraser,So let me pass over to Mark in terms of what are some of the examples of different areas of the drivers of growth?,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Jane Fraser,"This is, as I said at the beginning, this is a crown jewel.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Jane Fraser,It's not a source of complexity for the bank.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Mark Mason,"So Mike, I'd say a couple of things.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Mark Mason,"One, what I said was that we continue to gain share, and I referenced specifically about 60 basis points of share with large corporate clients.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Mark Mason,And we're also winning mandates and gaining share with other client segments as well.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Mark Mason,"You know that the Commercial Banking client segment is one that we are focused on, given the strength of our platform and its applicability to those sized clients as well.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Mark Mason,"I mentioned that our wins are up and specifically, they're up 20%, the mandates that we're winning across all client segments.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Mark Mason,"And that specifically with FIs, they're up almost 50%.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Mark Mason,"So hopefully, that gives you some sense of where the revenue growth is coming from.",revenue,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Mark Mason,The takeaway there is it's both existing as well as new clients as we kind of continue to build out the platform and build out our capabilities to reach them.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Mark Mason,So the second part of your question was around expenses and expenses growing and when will we have top line growth that exceeds the expense growth.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Mark Mason,And I'd remind you that the work we're doing on the transformation as well as the business-led investments are multiyear almost by definition and important in order to derive savings in our structural cost base over time.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Mark Mason,"And at Investor Day, I think I pointed to by the time we got to that medium-term period, we would see our operating efficiency go down to less than 60%.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Mark Mason,I think we've been very deliberate about trying to give you guidance and update you on guidance for the full year and along the way and we'll be consistent in that discipline.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Mark Mason,"And I can certainly give you more color on '23, as I mentioned earlier to John, in the next quarter.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Mike Mayo,I guess one clarification.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Mike Mayo,"When you say you've gained 60 basis points of share with large corporate clients, what do you mean by share, share of what?",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Mark Mason,"Yes, of wallet, 60 basis points, not 50, 60.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Mark Mason,So market share with them.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Operator,Our next question will come from Ebrahim Poonawala with Bank of America.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Ebrahim Poonawala,"I guess one, just, Mark, I wanted to clarify your NII guide for $1.5B to $1.8B, is just total NII, right?",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Ebrahim Poonawala,It's not ex Markets or anything?,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Mark Mason,It is ex Markets.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Ebrahim Poonawala,It is ex Markets.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Ebrahim Poonawala,"Any perspective or view on where you see Markets heading in fourth quarter, just given what's happened with the rate backdrop?",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Mark Mason,"I very intentionally don't forecast Markets NII in a rising rate environment, you would normally see the markets NII come down.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Mark Mason,It tends to be liability sensitive.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Mark Mason,"But we tend to focus on, as you probably heard me say a number of times, total revenues for this business.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Mark Mason,"And I guess what I'd highlight is that in periods of uncertainty and lots of market volatility, our businesses tend to perform well.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Mark Mason,And so we'll see how the fourth quarter plays out.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Mark Mason,There's obviously some seasonality to it that has taken place historically.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Mark Mason,"And so we have to kind of factor all those things in, but we'll have to see how it further evolves.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Operator,Our next question will come from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Betsy Graseck,Just two things.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Betsy Graseck,"One, just another question on the expense side.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Betsy Graseck,"I just wanted to follow up with regard to, Mark, the stranded costs that you had talked about at the Barclays conference.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Betsy Graseck,"And I'm wondering if I got the message right there, which is when you exit the consumer businesses, there's 25% that is generally managed through a TSA, so it's a service agreement and that expense will come off over time.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Betsy Graseck,"And then there's another 25%, which is likely not to come off.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Betsy Graseck,Is that fair?,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Betsy Graseck,Or is there a different message that I'm missing on that?,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Mark Mason,"Yeah, that's not fair.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Mark Mason,But I appreciate the add more clarity.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Mark Mason,So I bucket into 3 buckets.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Mark Mason,"So one is when we do these transactions, both Jane and I have deep experience in this.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Mark Mason,"We tend to see about half of the costs go away to the buyer, so when we do the transaction, when we do the sale.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Mark Mason,"As you pointed out, about 25% is often in place as part of a transition service agreement.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Mark Mason,And so there's revenues that we get paid to offset that expense until things have totally transitioned and then that goes away.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Mark Mason,"And then the third bucket is what I call potentially stranded cost and what Jane calls not stranded cost, right?",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Mark Mason,"And I say potentially because they are regional expenses that get allocated to countries, for example, they're global expenses that get allocated to the region and to the countries, for example, and what we have to do and what we're doing is we're attacking what would otherwise be stranded cost.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Mark Mason,"And we're attacking that by telling each of the functions in the business, and here's your portion of that 25% and come back and tell me how you're going to rethink your org structure, simplify your processes in order to drive that cost out of the company, right?",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Mark Mason,And so that's what we've been doing.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Mark Mason,"Remember, the expense base here is probably $7 billion.",billion,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Mark Mason,So you can break down kind of the population that we're talking about.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Mark Mason,"We've already stood up a team to work with each of the businesses and each of the functions around getting in front of that cost, so that we can drive that down over the near-term period of time.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Jane Fraser,"And as a Scotswoman, I just can't help myself but jump in here.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Jane Fraser,I think as Mark and I are both pretty maniacally focused around this.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Jane Fraser,"But I'd say at the moment, we've had a couple of the divestitures close.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Jane Fraser,"We have another 3 next quarter, and this continues on.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Jane Fraser,"We already started on Australia and the Philippines and getting those expenses down, as Mark said.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Jane Fraser,"There is going to be, and we will not be shy in capturing as an opportunity to simplify our organization further next year when we have more of the divestitures close and streamlining more of our regional management structures, more of the expenses at the global level.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Jane Fraser,"So there is more to come on that, and we'll be looking to do that as I indicated at Investor Day that will be an important part once more of the divestitures are closed, starting in '23, going into '24.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Betsy Graseck,Right.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Betsy Graseck,"So you were, Mark's potentially stranded costs, and Jane, you are no stranded cost.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Betsy Graseck,The no stranded cost is in the guide medium term?,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Mark Mason,In terms of the time to get it out – yes.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Jane Fraser,"And I think as Mark talks about expenses, you've got to look at the various different dynamics that are going on.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Jane Fraser,"So yes, we've got investments into the transformation at the moment.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Jane Fraser,"Many of those translate into better efficiency as well as a safer, stronger firm the divestitures translate into lower cost, but also we eliminate the stranded costs, and we simplify the organization.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Jane Fraser,You've got a number of different factors that we will make completely transparent to you at play in our expense base from a more structural dimension in the quarters ahead.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Operator,Our next question will come from Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Operator,MATT O’,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Connor,Can you guys talk about the pace of addressing some of the regulatory issues out there?,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Connor,"On the one hand, you got out of the AML consent order earlier this year, which I think was a very big positive.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Connor,"But on the other hand, there was an article last month, suggesting regulators want you to go faster.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Connor,"And I think we all know regulators always want things to go faster on these issues, but I did want to ask the question.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Jane Fraser,"We all want things to go faster, both our clients, our shareholders, the management team, regulators, the Board, all.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Jane Fraser,So I think we're fully aligned there.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Jane Fraser,Maybe if I take a step back on this one.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Jane Fraser,Transformation is our #1 priority.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Jane Fraser,It will be a multiyear journey and prioritizing safety and soundness is a very important global bank is a nonnegotiable for all of us.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Jane Fraser,Where are we?,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Jane Fraser,I think we were delighted to see the AML consent order get closed with the OCC.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,Yes,occ,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Jane Fraser,We continue to work on the regulatory orders we have.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Jane Fraser,"I have to say we have constant and constructive engagement with our regulators that personally, I find them to be very helpful and essential to our success.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Jane Fraser,We have got a lot to get done.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Jane Fraser,"As you can see from the hiring numbers, we've been investing heavily in the talent and the resources that we need.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Jane Fraser,"As we've also said, this is not only going to benefit our safety and soundness, but also in terms of our client, excellence in delivery and ultimately, for our shareholders as well.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Jane Fraser,I think the foundation that we need for this is largely in place.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Jane Fraser,"And so Mark and I and frankly, the whole management team, we're very focused on continuing to execute on the various plans we submitted and the overall transformation of Citi from a strategic and another dimension.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Jane Fraser,"We obviously can't give more details than that because this is confidential supervisory information, but I hope that gives you a good feel.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Jane Fraser,MATT O’,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Connor,"And I guess when you say the foundation is largely in place, like what are some of the things that are missing?",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Connor,"Or is it just a matter of, say, executing on the divestitures?",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Jane Fraser,It's timing.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Jane Fraser,"So some of the areas, for example, where we're making technology investments, those ones where we've had fragmented technology platforms, we're migrating them into a single platform or into an industry standard where we've not been on one that we want for the future.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Jane Fraser,Those things take some time to put in place.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Jane Fraser,"But you can see from the investments we've made, both headcount and the shift from consulting to much more of our own people.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Jane Fraser,You'll see the technology increase in that shift as well.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Jane Fraser,So some of that is just a natural progression you'd expect over time.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Operator,Our next question will come from Jim Mitchell with Seaport Global.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Jim Mitchell,Maybe just on deposits and behavior.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Jim Mitchell,You guys clearly have a different mix by geography and by business.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Jim Mitchell,Deposits ex currency were up 1%.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Jim Mitchell,Your peers were down close to 3%.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Jim Mitchell,So how do we think about deposit behavior going forward given your mix of geography and business?,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Jim Mitchell,"Is it just the overseas rate hikes have been behind the curve versus the U.S., but we'll start to see more deposit outflows over there?",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Jim Mitchell,Or do you think your deposits can hold up a little better.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Mark Mason,"Yes, it's a great question, and so why don't I take that, so a couple of things, and you started to allude to it.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Mark Mason,"The first is that when you think about our business, you've got about between ICG and our PBWM business of 65%, 35% split in terms of the deposits.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Mark Mason,You also have a U.S. dollar denominated versus non-U.S. dollar-denominated split that is pretty meaningful as well.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Mark Mason,"And then to your point, we've got different currencies and different rate hikes by different central banks around the world.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Mark Mason,And that then is juxtaposed against different beta behavior from customers.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Mark Mason,"And so on the ICG side, we tend to see higher betas.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Mark Mason,"And obviously, with rates increasing at a more rapid pace, we expect those to get closer to our expectations in the near term.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Mark Mason,"We're starting to see many more hikes around the globe or outside of the U.S. And so again, we expect to see betas which operate at a much lower pace level outside of the U.S. but start to tick up.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Mark Mason,"And so over time, I think we will see continued tailwinds from an NII as the differences between U.S. and non U.S. activity play out.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Mark Mason,"And so that has played to our benefit, I think, and should continue to play to our benefit.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Mark Mason,"If you think about what I've talked about before in terms of our IRE, our interest rate exposure, and the cash flow approach that we are moving towards taking, in some ways it captures exactly that point.",cash flow,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Mark Mason,"And so if you see a 100 basis point move in the curve cross currencies, we're looking at as much as a $2.2 billion increase.",billion,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Mark Mason,"And when you look at that increase, it skews more heavily towards the non-U.S. dollar than the U.S. dollar.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Mark Mason,And that is in part because of the different moves in rate curves by currency as well as the different betas by client type in U.S. versus non-U.S.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Jim Mitchell,That's really helpful.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Jim Mitchell,And then maybe just a second question just on the impact in the fourth quarter.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Jim Mitchell,"You’re closing on 3 divestitures, how do we think about the P&L and capital impact of that in the fourth quarter?",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Mark Mason,"I think I talked about the idea of the divestitures contributing close to $3 billion for the full year, $3.1 or so billion in terms of the capital impact for the full year 2022.","billion, ",yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Mark Mason,The combination of Australia and the Philippines gets us to about $2.1 billion or so.,billion,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Mark Mason,"And so the balance of the divestitures that we've scoped out for the fourth quarter should close that gap, Thailand, Malaysia, Bahrain, the signing of China, et cetera, should close that gap to getting us to that $3.1 billion.",billion,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Mark Mason,"With most of that is skewing towards the first 3, Thailand, Malaysia, Bahrain.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Operator,Our next question will come from Gerard Cassidy with RBC.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Gerard Cassidy,"Jane, you talked about your global footprint and the strength that gives you as an organization.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Gerard Cassidy,"And so maybe this question is very appropriate for Citigroup, which is the following.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Gerard Cassidy,You guys have a real good window into the global financial markets.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Gerard Cassidy,"And there's been some disruption out there, we all know about what's going on in the U.K. pension funds.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Gerard Cassidy,You had the Swiss National Bank come into the New York Fed this week for $6.3 billion of currency swaps.,billion,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Gerard Cassidy,"We know there's a large broker having challenges over there.So can you guys give us a flavor, what are you seeing from a stress standpoint.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Gerard Cassidy,What are the liquidity metrics that you're watching to see if some other stresses pop up how the global financial markets will handle that?,liquidity,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Jane Fraser,It's a very good question.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Jane Fraser,It's one we spend a lot of time on.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Jane Fraser,"And I think as Mark alluded, we're constantly doing different stress tests on the market, on clients on different areas.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Jane Fraser,"And as I said in the opening remarks, we're more focused on the liquidity in the market at the moment and the impact on some counterparties much more than we are on our credit risk, that could change over time, depending particularly what happens from a tail risk on the geopolitics here.",liquidity,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Jane Fraser,What are we seeing going on?,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,

2022,Q3,Jane Fraser,"So we're watching industrial production moved to the U.S., for example, which are the places where the cost of production is lower, a potential buffer for some of the slowdown in U.S. manufacturing and the like because the demand for goods softened, for example.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Jane Fraser,"We're seeing areas where clients on the collateral front, where there's a situation of intense volatility that hits or a surprise drop as we saw in gilts is having an impact on liquidity and therefore, margining, which is what happens and has been happening with the U.K. pension funds with the derivatives.",liquidity,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Jane Fraser,"So a lot of the areas we look at is what's the collateral behind different institutions as we have done with the commodity players earlier on in the year, we've been looking at some of the LDIs at the moment.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Jane Fraser,"And as we see different stresses, we're jumping on it.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Jane Fraser,I think the central banks are also ready to jump in as needed and certainly attuned to the importance of agility in these situations as well.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Jane Fraser,"As our large global institutions like ourselves as to how do we help support the market, the benefit for our bank is because we're in a strong position on all of our capital, on liquidity, on balance sheet and the credit portfolio, as you can see, is extraordinary at the moment, zero losses in ICG this quarter.",liquidity,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Jane Fraser,"Again, we're in a position to be able to jump in and play an important role.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Jane Fraser,"But it's a bit of whack-a-mole, I would say.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Gerard Cassidy,Very good.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Gerard Cassidy,"And then, Mark, just as a follow-up.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Gerard Cassidy,You touched on your investment banking numbers and your markets numbers.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Gerard Cassidy,"And yes, investment banking for everybody has been a struggle, obviously, this year.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Gerard Cassidy,"Your advisory numbers actually were better than your peers on a year-over year basis in terms of growth, but DCM was quite a bit weaker.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Gerard Cassidy,Can you kind of give us a little more color there?,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Gerard Cassidy,"And also, how do the pipelines look going into the fourth quarter?",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Mark Mason,"So look, as we've all seen, the wallets have been under meaningful pressure year-over-year down more than 50%.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Mark Mason,We did show some strong performance in parts of the business.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Mark Mason,"We've been hiring, frankly, as Jane has mentioned before and filling in gaps that we have across the portfolio in health care, tech, energy, et cetera, and feel good about that and are seeing benefits from having made those hires.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Mark Mason,DCM is really more of a function of low deal volume pretty much across the board.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Mark Mason,And there really isn't a whole lot more to it than that.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Mark Mason,"But as you know, investment banking is part of the strategy that we discussed at Investor Day and a key part at that and we'll continue to invest in it and ensure we're getting the productivity out of it that the investment warrants, but really not a whole lot more in DCM beyond the low deal volume across the board.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Operator,Our next question will come from Vivek Juneja with JPMorgan.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Vivek Juneja,Couple of questions for you.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Vivek Juneja,"Firstly, Mark, I just want to clarify, you said NII ex Markets to be up $1.5 to $1.8 billion year- on-year in the fourth quarter.",", billion",no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Vivek Juneja,You were up $1.9 billion year-on-year in the third quarter.,billion,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Vivek Juneja,"Given that there have been more rate hikes during the quarter and even later in the quarter, any color on what's driving that slightly lower NII accretion rather than actually being up at a faster pace?",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Mark Mason,"Again, the important factors here include volume, what we see in both the loan volume, the deposit volume and obviously, betas and how betas play out, and we talked about the idea that with the higher frequency and level of rate increases, that's going to put pressure on the beta in terms of seeing it increase across the board.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Mark Mason,"And then the third factor is rates and what happens with the rates and the timing for which that happens, right?",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Mark Mason,"When that happens, matters in the quarter in terms of whether you see that benefit in it or in subsequent quarters.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Mark Mason,And so those are the factors that drive that range that I've given you.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Mark Mason,And it's across both the PBWM portfolio as well as how it plays out in TTS.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Mark Mason,"And given the world we're managing through, quantitative tightening and the like, and I think the other factor is obviously FX and how that plays out.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Mark Mason,"So those are the main drivers, Vivek, and the range reflects any variety of ways that they could play out in the quarter.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Vivek Juneja,Completely different question for both of you.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Vivek Juneja,"Securities Services, you talked about $1 trillion in new business wins seems to be doing really well.",trillion,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Vivek Juneja,"Any color, if you can remind us on which client segments you're seeing this in?",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Vivek Juneja,"And I remember you're saying on the call that it's domestic also, but any more color into where you're growing and where you're seeing all this?",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Jane Fraser,"We're seeing this in a number of different areas, the one that is most material was the win we had with BlackRock in a particularly sizable percentage of business there here in the States and in a particularly important and attractive part of the Securities Services business as well.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Jane Fraser,But we have been winning some sizable business across the board.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Jane Fraser,"And a part of this, I think, comes from the fact that we're able to link the pre and post trade together to drive a lot of efficiencies for our clients and bring some insights that some of the other players are not able to do in helping them manage and get competitive advantage in their businesses.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Jane Fraser,So we're an attractive one from that.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Jane Fraser,"Mark, anything else to add?",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Mark Mason,"I mean we're very pleased with the growth here and the win mandates that we've been seeing across the board, but particularly in the U.S., as Jane highlights.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Mark Mason,"And some of it is a rate benefit, but a good portion of it is again, those new mandates, those new additional assets that we're bringing in.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Mark Mason,"The final point that I'd make on it is that, and I'd reiterate it, I guess, is that this is not only one of our businesses that's growing quite rapidly, but it's also a high returning business for us as well.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Mark Mason,"And so consistent with the strategy that we talked about at Investor Day and one that reflects linkages across the franchise, and so we feel very good about that.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Operator,Our next question will come from Ken Usdin with Jefferies.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Ken Usdin,Just two quick ones.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Ken Usdin,"Mark, you talked about the capital impact of the legacy exits.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Ken Usdin,Is there a way you can dimension how much in the fourth quarter from revenues and NII perspective comes out from the legacy?,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Mark Mason,"I do not have that in front of me, Ken.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Mark Mason,"I've got a page in here, page 22 reflects some of the size of the exit markets, but I do not have that in front of me.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Mark Mason,"I'd have to circle back with you, Ken.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Ken Usdin,"I would assume that's been a part of the prior question about NII trajectory, right?",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Ken Usdin,"There's a negative impact embedded in that in the fourth quarter as well, right?",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Ken Usdin,That's just part of the movement forward.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Mark Mason,"Yes, that is reflected in the NII guidance, but the major drivers are largely what I referenced.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Mark Mason,"But yes, it would be reflected in it.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,

2022,Q3,Jane Fraser,"Mike, as I mentioned in my earlier remarks, we are now informing our multinational clients who are operating in Russia, so these are the U.S., European and Asian core multinationals or the franchise that we are ending nearly all of the institutional banking services.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Jane Fraser,"We offer them by the end of the first quarter of 2023, the cost of which I would add is not material.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Jane Fraser,"And so at that point, our only operations in Russia will be those necessary to fulfill our remaining legal and regulatory operations there.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Jane Fraser,"It's been very important for those multinationals that we've helped support them as they look at exiting the country and their payroll and other elements as they do so, so they've been able to wind down or exit and a few of those who have remained.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Jane Fraser,"But we will be, as I said at the very beginning, our intention here is to wind down our operation in the country.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q3,Mike Mayo,"And then just if you could remind us, you mentioned more dispositions in the fourth quarter.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,

2022,Q3,Jane Fraser,"And I think those ones again, a couple of them have been rather than ones that you have a legal day 1, legal day 2 on.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,

2023,Q3,Jane Fraser,"And the first piece is simple, which is our org model was set up for a financial supermarket,that is simply not the bank we are today.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Jane Fraser,So we are aligning the organizational model with that simper business mix and strategy.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Jane Fraser,But what's truly different is we're changing how we run the bank.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,

2023,Q3,Jane Fraser,"And the types of metrics we are looking at to help us measure this spans layers, revenue producers and non producers, grade mixes, synergies that we're realizing, voice of the client, but I say that our expectations and our execution of the business strategy is also at the heart of what we're trying to drive here.",revenue,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Jane Fraser,Our strength is our global network.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Jane Fraser,I don't want our geographies focused on the full monty of management processes that are a duplication of what's happening in the product organization.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Jane Fraser,"I want them focused on delivering to our clients, engaging with our clients and also managing their responsibilities of the legal entities.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,

2023,Q3,Jane Fraser,Or selling our Banking products suite into that Commercial Bank customer and other examples.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,

2023,Q3,Jane Fraser,We put a huge amount of work all the way through the summer in design as to how do we want the organization to work.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Jane Fraser,That is now getting driven down into the designing in detail and in depth all of these types of activities through the second and third layers at the moment into the fourth and then until we finish at the end of the first quarter.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Operator,And our next question comes from Glenn Schorr with Evercore.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Glenn Schorr,"So, I'm curious, you mentioned that you're still marching towards the 11%, 12%, which is good because everyone was going to ask that.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Glenn Schorr,"My question is a little bit different of, with the denominator going up 25%, in other words, a lot of things are working towards your Transformation, but there's sort of a curve ball in there with upping the denominator by 25%.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Glenn Schorr,"So, you seem to be a beneficiary of higher for longer for sure.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Glenn Schorr,And you also mentioned you're working on mitigation as we speak.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Glenn Schorr,"So, maybe you could talk about what are the offsets that we don't see that give you confidence still working towards that, because the top line stuff is working?",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Mark Mason,"So, good morning, Glenn, it's good to hear from you.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Mark Mason,"Let me make a couple comments on that, and then, Jane, feel free to chime in if you'd like.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Mark Mason,"The first thing is that when I talked about this at the last conference we attended, I mentioned that analysts were somewhere in the 16% to 19% range in terms of a capital increase, and we're likely to be inside of that range, assuming the Basel III proposal as i s structured, as it's written, and obviously that's not the final, there's a period of review that's going on now.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,Yes,basel iii,No,
2023,Q3,Mark Mason,"What I'd say is a couple things, Glenn.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Mark Mason,"One, we haven't fully executed against the strategy that Jane has just described.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Mark Mason,"And obviously, continuing to simplify the business, managing through the Transformation, changing that business mix that we have to something that's more consistent and predictable and repeatable as it relates to PPNR, those things matter and impact the SCB.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Mark Mason,We talked about the exiting of the international consumer businesses.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Mark Mason,"That will be a factor in what our balance sheet looks like and what stress losses might look like as well as lowering the expense base, which we know is an important factor in that PPNR math as well.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Mark Mason,"And so, those things help, I think, to reduce the amount of capital that might be required as we get into that medium-term period.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Mark Mason,"Importantly, as you point out, there are other elements of the proposal that are going to require that we take a hard look at as well and identify mitigating actions to the extent that they make it into the final.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Mark Mason,"So, think about the increase in operational risk and the fact that some of that is already included in SCB as something of a point of advocacy.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Mark Mason,"But that's obviously a big headwind that we'll have to kind of work through, the FRTB and the enhancement of models.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Mark Mason,"Now, there's a global market shock as well, but again another point of advocacy that we need to work through.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Mark Mason,"The equity investments, and now that they go from 100% risk weighting to 400% risk weighting, I think we're going to take a hard look at whether those are worth keeping in light of the higher capital associated with them.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Mark Mason,"That's going to challenge the returns, that's going to force us to look at those through a different strategic lens, and we're going to do that.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Mark Mason,"And that's not to even mention the credit component that impacts both corporates and consumers as it relates to unfunded commitments, for example.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Mark Mason,"And so, as we've done with SA-CCR and other types of reg changes, we're going to have to look at what it means for our product mix, the returns associated with those, whether there are opportunities to pull levers like pricing, or whether we have to take other decisions around those.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Mark Mason,"And so, that's what I mean by the mitigating actions that we're dimensioning and putting on paper and working through, but again, want to be thoughtful because the rule is not final yet, and there are more discussions to be had around those important elements that I mentioned already.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Operator,And our next question comes from Erika Najarian with UBS.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,

2023,Q3,Erika Najarian,"But I'm wondering, for both Jane and Mark, if you could sort of address what I think is probably the most debated part of your target, which is that revenue CAGR of 5%.",revenue,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Erika Najarian,"You put up a very nice quarter in terms of revenues, both net interest income and fees.",net interest income,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Erika Najarian,And maybe help us sort of look underneath the surface in terms of that momentum and maybe break it down in terms of what's really going well.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Erika Najarian,"I think TTS continues to surprise to the upside, are we going to be, two years from now, we re going to be like, oh, well, TTS is continuing to be doing well.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Erika Najarian,"So, what are the businesses that really sort of strong secular momentum that you feel is being under-recognized versus how you could position cyclically and higher for longer?",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Erika Najarian,And what is still to come as we think about that path to at least the numerator of that RoTCE target?,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Jane Fraser,"I love this question, Erika, because I have to say I m really excited about our strategy and the potential it has.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Jane Fraser,"And it is, as you say, this is about the revenue potential of the firm and really how do we continue to unlock it.",revenue,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,

2023,Q3,Jane Fraser,"The corporate client of today, and indeed consumer, has to build resiliency.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Jane Fraser,"The multinational client is on a long-term trend of building resiliency, be it because of green, be it because of geopolitics, be it because of regulatory, whatever the different reasons may be, and there are multiple, they're having to build resiliency into supply chains, into their own operations as they operate around the world.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Jane Fraser,W the bank that is absolutely there for them.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Jane Fraser,"And I think you've seen that in TTS, where we've had such strong drivers of growth in the last few years at the beginning of this trend.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Jane Fraser,"So, that is an important one.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,

2023,Q3,Jane Fraser,And it's connected globally.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Jane Fraser,"So, this thing is just a thing of beauty.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Jane Fraser,Linked into it is what I think of as a hidden gem amongst our crown jewels is Securities Services.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,

2023,Q3,Jane Fraser,We've quite a long way to run here.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,

2023,Q3,Jane Fraser,"And as you can see, we've not been happy with our performance the last couple of years, but this is going to be a very important driver for us.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Jane Fraser,We'll see the recovery in banking wallet eventually.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,

2023,Q3,Jane Fraser,That will be another driver.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Jane Fraser,"And I'd say cards continuing to go from strength to strength, particularly I think as we look forward, playing to our lending-led model there.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,

2023,Q3,Jane Fraser,"And we're serving them, helping them go international for the first step, tap them into global supply chains and the like.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Jane Fraser,It's almost by definition the fastest growing of the mid-market companies are the ones that tap into what we can offer them.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Jane Fraser,We build great relationships with them.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Jane Fraser,"And then our private bankers call on them, and then our investment bankers call on them.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Jane Fraser,We have our capital market teams calling on them.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Jane Fraser,And we help them grow and succeed.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Jane Fraser,And that is going to be a big engine in the medium-term of new client acquisition feeding us.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Jane Fraser,"So, deeper client relationships, more growth in terms of new clients that fit with our proposition fairly uniquely, and some great mega trends that we are going to be riding and pretty uniquely positioned on.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Jane Fraser,"And we'll keep investing to make sure that where areas we're behind we get into the forefront of and the areas we are crushing it in, like our win rate is 82% in TTS, and we're going to make sure that we continue to do so and innovate that way.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Jane Fraser,"So, sorry to be so excited about this, the 4% to 5% just feels very, very doable to Mark and I.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Operator,And our next question comes from Jim Mitchell with Seaport Global.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Jim Mitchell,Hey good morning.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Jim Mitchell,"Mark, maybe on the revenue discussion there, let's talk about NII a little bit.",revenue,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Jim Mitchell,"You guys have a very unique deposit base, a lot smaller footprint in low-cost consumer.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Jim Mitchell,"Betas have been, already been high, so it doesn't seem like there's as much beta catch-up risk for you.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Jim Mitchell,It's 50% non-US roughly.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Jim Mitchell,"How do you think about the trajectory of NII, do you think it stabilizes next year before rate cuts?",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Jim Mitchell,How do we think about the puts and takes on your NII into next year?,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Mark Mason,"Yeah, thanks for the question.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Mark Mason,Look.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Mark Mason,"I'm not going to give guidance for 2024, we'll do that obviously at the fourth quarter 2023 earnings.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Mark Mason,But I think it's reasonable to expect that some of the trends that we've seen so far will continue.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Mark Mason,"So, if you think about what's underneath this, we'll continue to benefit from higher rates across currencies.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Mark Mason,I think we'll continue to see benefits from card interest-earning balance growth.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Mark Mason,"Recall that when you look at our US dollar IRE position, it's relatively neutral at this point.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Mark Mason,And interest earning balance growth is expected to be driven by continued card spend and lower payment rates.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Mark Mason,"And so, I think what's important to remember, as it relates to our business, is that it's global.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Mark Mason,"That we've got, while you're right in that, on the U.S. dollar side, we've seen betas kind of reach, particularly for our corporate clients, reach terminal levels at the end of last year.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Mark Mason,"On the non-US dollar side, betas run lower.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Mark Mason,They lag.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Mark Mason,And there's still upside there because it's a different rate curve and a different pace of increases.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Mark Mason,"And so, those will be some of the puts and takes to think about.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Mark Mason,"Volumes, the rates, the speed of the curve moves, and then how betas evolve, that will kind of factor in.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Operator,And our next question comes from Ryan Kenny with Morgan Stanley.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Ryan Kenny,Hey good morning.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Ryan Kenny,"On the capital markets side, I heard the comments around it being hard to predict when deal activity will sustainably rebound.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Ryan Kenny,"Can you just give us an update or more color on how CEOs are thinking about bringing deals live across M&A, ECM and DCM?",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Ryan Kenny,And does the market and rate volatility over the last few weeks have any significant impact on bringing deals to completion or on the pipeline?,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Jane Fraser,"Well, I think a couple pieces.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Jane Fraser,I actually start with Q3 is the seventh quarter of the current IB downturn.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Jane Fraser,"So, since 2000, downturns have tended not to last longer than seven quarters because that's often how long it takes for pricing expectations to fully adjust to new realities.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Jane Fraser,"And we're starting to see that particularly in the debt capital markets, investment grade markets, where the expectation of no longer how high, but how long for rates, we've seen clients who get off the sidelines and just bite the bullet and get into the debt capital markets in a more meaningful way and no longer waiting on that.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Jane Fraser,"We still think that how our recovery and return to normal wallet plays out, when you talk to CEOs, is largely dependent on the macro environment.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Jane Fraser,That's the main piece for them.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Jane Fraser,"ECM, we're seeing increased interest and activity on ECM.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Jane Fraser,"You obviously had several IPOs coming to market in September, three big ones that we were involved in.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Jane Fraser,But the marketis still somewhat fragile.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Jane Fraser,We're watching it closely.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Jane Fraser,"And quite a few questions in Q4, things may move to Q1.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Jane Fraser,We just have to see how that unfolds.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Jane Fraser,But there's a good pipeline.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Jane Fraser,"I mean, there's a lot of pent-up demand here.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Jane Fraser,"In debt, we had a big pick-up in DCM.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Jane Fraser,We feel confident that the gradual recovery in DCM and the beginnings of that lev fin one will continue.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Jane Fraser,You're certainly going the see us more active in the lev fin space in the right situations for our key clients.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Jane Fraser,"And then in M&A, a healthy M&A sell-side pipeline.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Jane Fraser,A lot of companies with their industries transforming are really wanting to think big.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Jane Fraser,"I think we'll see that unlocking when sentiment improves further, companies do accept the new pricing reality, which will be helped by a rebound in equity markets.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Jane Fraser,"That obviously, from our end, takes quite a few quarters to materialize into revenue just given the nature of the product.",revenue,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Jane Fraser,"So, it's there, but I think just given where everything is geopolitically and particularly from the macro, no one is going to make that call as to when we're going to see that sustainable turn in banking at this point.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Operator,And our next question comes from Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Steven Chubak,"So, Mark and Jane, I do recognize you'll provide a more fulsome update on expense actions next quarter, but one of the things I was hoping was that you could frame the expense opportunity in the context of your headcount trends.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Steven Chubak,"And prior to COVID, as well as the consent order, mind you, Citi was running with 200,000 direct staff.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Steven Chubak,"That number is closer to 240,000 today.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Steven Chubak,"It's an increase of 20%, even with multiple divestitures that you've consummated.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Steven Chubak,"So how should we think about an appropriate target or an optimal level of headcount for Citi versus that pre-COVID baseline of 200,000, and whether the consent order would impact the timing or magnitude of such headcount actions?",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Mark Mason,"So, look, I'm not going to give you headcount guidance, but what I will say is Jane has talked before about the heads associated with the divestitures that are underway.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Mark Mason,"And obviously as we continue to progress in those divestitures, we've made a lot of progress already, we'll see those heads come down.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Mark Mason,"It's also important to point out that as part of our effort, there's been in-sourcing.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Mark Mason,"And so, we've captured the extended workforce in the headcount that we have here.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Mark Mason,"And then I think the final point is that as we continue to execute against the Transformation work, and as we implement the org simplification that we've just announced, undoubtedly the technology investment, the automation that we're putting in place, the straight-through processing that occurs, the fewer reconciliations that are required, the streamlining from all of those layers that Jane mentioned we'll be eliminating, all of those things will also work to reduce headcount as well.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Mark Mason,"And so, while we're investing and hiring on the front-end to capture the upside as markets turn, but also as we position ourselves to grow with clients, we're also going to realize efficiencies that come out of headcount reduction.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Mark Mason,One additional point is that you've heard me mention before that we've taken probably about $600 million or so year-to-date in repositioning charges.,million,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Mark Mason,"And with that will come roughly 7,000 or so headcount coming down associated with those repositioning charges.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Mark Mason,"And so, and we'll continue to do that, by the way, we haven't even begun to take repositioning charges associated with the org simplification that's underway.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Mark Mason,That will come in the fourth quarter and then the first quarter of next year.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Mark Mason,"And so, we will see heads continue to evolve through this process, but keep in mind that there are puts and takes associated with that as we look at where we need to in-source versus use external parties.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Operator,And our next question comes from Ebrahim Poonawala with Bank of America.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Ebrahim Poonawala,"Good morning.Just maybe, Mark, following up on that, as we think about bending the curve through the end of next year, maybe if you can talk to around as we think about the puts and takes between investments and expense saves, how much of that cost save or bending the curve is going to happen in Legacy versus PBWM and ICG?",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Ebrahim Poonawala,"Like, just how do you break, how should we think about that as we think about bending the curve and where the savings are coming from?",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Mark Mason,"Well, look, next year, we talked about expenses coming down from third quarter to fourth quarter.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Mark Mason,"And as we think about that, you'll have some of the benefits of the costs going away from the exits that we would have announced.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Mark Mason,"You have some of the benefit from further reduction in stranded cost, which we've been keenly focused on as we've exited each of these.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Mark Mason,"And then I think as we get to the medium term, you will start to see some of the benefits from the Transformation spend and investments that we would have made start to play out, as well as efficiencies that we start to get in a lower structural cost base.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Mark Mason,"But again, that's in that medium-term period.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Mark Mason,"So, all of those things will be drivers to getting the bending of the curve.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Mark Mason,"I haven't broken down, I'm not going to break down here on this call how much comes from each of the pieces, but all are important factors to achieving that.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Operator,And our next question comes from Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Operator,: Hi.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Operator,"There were some quotes, I think, in the media, Jane, from you talking about some signs of pressure among the lower end of the consumer, and I appreciate the pie chart that you have in the deck showing it's not a huge percent of the card portfolio.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Operator,But could you elaborate on that?,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Operator,"And then also just address the, you mentioned directionally how the payment rates in cards are coming down, but if we look at the growth in spend versus the growth in loans, it is kind of a little disproportionate.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Operator,"I think spend is up a couple percent year-over-year, and the loans are 11%.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Operator,"So, as we think about being kind of later-cycle, is that something that you're paying attention to as a potential sign of further weakness in credit?",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Jane Fraser,Yeah.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Jane Fraser,"Look, I think most of the pressure in the lower FICO, we don't have a lot of customers in lower FICO, so, we're seeing it out in the market.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Jane Fraser,"We've got, we obviously have some in the Retail Services business, we also, I would say, have the benefit of that loss sharing agreement that really makes a difference there because we're having to reserve fully for that, but we get it back on the revenue line, as you know.",revenue,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Jane Fraser,"But as we look at the off-us book, as we look at some of the pressures in the market, as we look at spending, we can certainly see some of that pressure for the lower FICO, whereas when I think about the cards business, it's very much driven by the affluent customer.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Jane Fraser,"So, the affluent is accounting for almost all the spending growth that we're seeing.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Jane Fraser,"And that's similar for the numbers that we saw coming out of the Fed from the deposit side, the excess savings are sitting there now primarily with households with over $150,000 of income, and it's down in the rest.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Jane Fraser,"So, these are things we're keeping an eye on.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Jane Fraser,"I want to be very clear, I'm not that worried about it for Citi given the prime nature of our card portfolio, and then the rest of our PBWM exposure is obviously very affluent.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Jane Fraser,"But when I look out at the market, I talk to our corporate clients, that's where we tend to see them being more nervous about the softness in the consumer.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Jane Fraser,"And just, I call it they're much more mindful about where they're spending, right?",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Jane Fraser,"So, you're seeing them moving down within a category.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Jane Fraser,They're certainly looking more on the bargain front.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Jane Fraser,We've been hearing that from our retail partners.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Jane Fraser,We've been hearing that across the board.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Jane Fraser,"So, growth of card loans is good.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Jane Fraser,"Our spend is up, but less than loans.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Jane Fraser,"I think it's softening, but it's not worrying.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Mark Mason,Yeah.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Mark Mason,"I think that's spot on, Jane.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Mark Mason,"The only thing I'd add is that when you look at the payment rates in Branded Cards, while they've started to come down, they're still above the pre-COVID level.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Mark Mason,And we obviously have invested in this business.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Mark Mason,"So, the other thing that's driving this is the new account acquisitions are obviously important drivers of that spend volume and ultimately that loan growth.",loan growth,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Mark Mason,"But again, there's nothing that we see outside of what we were expecting in terms of how this portfolio is normalizing.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Operator,Our next question comes from Gerard Cassidy with RBC.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Gerard Cassidy,"Good morning, Jane and good morning Mark.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Gerard Cassidy,"Jane, as you pointed out, you're very excited about the opportunities in TTS.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Gerard Cassidy,You're winning some new mandates in the custody business.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Gerard Cassidy,Can you feel is it because the competition is struggling with other issues?,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Gerard Cassidy,"What gives you, because Citi has always been well-regarded in this area, so what gives you that added excitement that this is even getting better?",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Jane Fraser,"Look, I think the added excitement is, a lot of it's coming from the investments that we've been making.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Jane Fraser,"So that we are, if you look at it in terms of Payment Express, which is live in the U.S., Thailand, on track for three more markets, that is really a very differentiating capability.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Jane Fraser,"The momentum we have in 24/7 clearing that's been put in place, we've had over $1 billion processed year-to-date.",billion,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Jane Fraser,Putting our Commercial Bank clients onto CitiDirect so they have seamless access to our whole TTS network globally.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Jane Fraser,"You heard us talking about Citi Token Services, you can see us innovating with the Fed in new capabilities.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Jane Fraser,"So really across the board, it's that innovation in cutting-edge, first-in-the-market type of capabilities.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Jane Fraser,"But you're putting that on top of a network that's just unprecedented in terms of its presence, its local capabilities, its payroll, cash management, liquidity management, its collections, its receivables, all sitting on one platform connected globally.",liquidity,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Jane Fraser,"And what that gives a client in terms of efficiency saves, insights on data, what they can do in terms of risk management and how to really optimize their treasury capabilities.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Jane Fraser,"I mean, this thing is a thing of beauty.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Jane Fraser,"And it's very, very hard, it's very sticky,to extricate from this because it's embedded into how our clients do business, it's that critical and into their technology systems.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Jane Fraser,"So, when you look at where the world's headed and what's going on in the world, volatility, these other elements, it's hard not to see opportunities.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Jane Fraser,And it's opportunities as well with our Markets business linked in.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Jane Fraser,One of our really differentiating factors that Andy Morton talks about all the time is his partnership with TTS.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Jane Fraser,"The fact that one of our major client bases are corporates and they have a different profile, let's say, to an asset manager or a hedge fund.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Jane Fraser,And we uniquely can serve them.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Jane Fraser,"So, that's the piece.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Jane Fraser,It's that combination in trends we see.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Mark Mason,"I think that's spot on, Jane.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Mark Mason,"The only thing I'd add is that the middle market commercial space is a huge opportunity for us, as you said earlier, leveraging that TTS platform.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Mark Mason,"And then on the Securities Services side, the reality is that we're finally seeing real traction in North America, right?",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Mark Mason,"We've always had kind of strength in many of the other regions, but we're really winning some major mandates here in North America, which I think is enough to get really excited about.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Jane Fraser,"And I think that, to me, is what then drives a lot of the strategy and what we're trying to do in terms of get to that high quality of earnings, better earnings mix, and other pieces that will help us get to that medium-term return target that we are so focused on.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Operator,Our next question comes from Vivek Juneja with JP Morgan.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Vivek Juneja,Want to just clarify the reorganization a little bit.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Vivek Juneja,"So, Jane, I heard you say that you're keeping North Asia and South Asia heads.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Vivek Juneja,"So, did you just get rid of the Asia head and get rid of the product heads, where product heads in each country were reporting to a regional product head?",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Vivek Juneja,"So, is that that dotted line is no longer there or what's going on there?",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Vivek Juneja,"And when you get rid of all the monthly management reporting, what are you planning to replace that with from your management, your MIS perspective?",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Jane Fraser,"So, let me take the second one first.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Jane Fraser,I'm not planning on replacing it with anything.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Jane Fraser,We don't need them.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Jane Fraser,We're no longer running consumer franchises in the countries.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Jane Fraser,"Instead, we've got global businesses that are operating very consistently in the individual geographies, so we just don't need to replace them.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Jane Fraser,"And it enables us just to have the legal entity, financial management that we need.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Jane Fraser,And then our internal reports get greatly simplified.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Jane Fraser,"Same as they get greatly simplified by taking out ICG and PBWM is another, eliminating that layer also eliminates a lot of different reports.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Jane Fraser,"So, the wonderful answer is, nothing, a simpler Citi.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Jane Fraser,"The first question was about, okay, help you understand what we've done.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Jane Fraser,"So, on the geography front, we have done two main things already.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Jane Fraser,One is we've eliminated the regions and have just put a single international head reporting to me.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Jane Fraser,"So, that makes it much simpler for me.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Jane Fraser,"I have one international head, and then he will help us manage the geographies collectively.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Jane Fraser,The second piece is we really narrowed the mandate of geography to delivering to our clients and covering our clients in their countries.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Jane Fraser,"And secondly, the legal entity management.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Jane Fraser,"And otherwise, before, we had a huge amount of management on shadow P&Ls and different, a lot of very heavy committee structure.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Jane Fraser,"That was necessary because the business was still very local, as a retail bank, a local credit card business, a local onshore wealth business.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Jane Fraser,They've gone.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Jane Fraser,It's just serving multinationals.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Jane Fraser,The subsidiaries are multinationals and in some markets the investors and the wealth clients in some markets.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Jane Fraser,And that's a much simpler business to manage.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Jane Fraser,"So, we could get rid of the regional layer, and we just jump straight down to the clusters that we have today.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Jane Fraser,"They too have less of a mandate than they had before, a much more focused one.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Jane Fraser,"And the bit that I'm excited about is not just, yes, this makes it much simpler to manage, but it also helps us really focus on the global network.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Jane Fraser,"Now, our geographies and our banking organizations sitting together on the same management structure are collectively accountable for serving and delivering against our core client base.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Jane Fraser,And they're in one team to do it.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Jane Fraser,It just makes it much easier.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Jane Fraser,Does that give you a feel?,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Jane Fraser,"What else, Mark?",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Mark Mason,"The other thing, Vivek, that I think is important here is we really want to spend a little bit more investment in time on the client lens in terms of the financial reporting, right?",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Mark Mason,"Because, as Jane talked about, we talked about the synergies across the franchise that we can capture, the ability to leverage the offering we have for those different client segments.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Mark Mason,"So, looking at that P&L, looking at those returns, looking at that growth opportunity through that client lens will be something where we want to enhance the metrics that we have already around that so that we can capture that upside.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Jane Fraser,"And around the other piece that I think is also just an important point, globalization is changing and we're seeing these lanes all changing through trade, financial flows, et cetera.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Jane Fraser,"By actually having a single international organization and then the different clusters, North and South Asia, Europe, UK, LATAM, Middle East, Africa, the connection points between them are really changing at the moment.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Jane Fraser,"And so, this makes us much more agile in our delivery of the global network because I think it's much more in line with how the world is operating today.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Operator,And our next question comes from Saul Martinez with HSBC.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Saul Martinez,"So, I wanted to continue on the thread of normalization of credit losses.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Saul Martinez,"And you guys have, I guess your guidance is implying that Branded Cards and Retail Services get back to more normalized levels by year-end, which is a decent-sized uptick over the levels you had in the third quarter.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Saul Martinez,"So, I kind of want to know what's driving that view.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Saul Martinez,"But more importantly I guess, what does that imply going forward?",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Saul Martinez,"And does it imply that we get to more, something more like above trend losses?",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Saul Martinez,Because I would think we still have some seasoning to go on the late 2021 and 2022 vintages.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Saul Martinez,"And not only that, talking about this in an environment where we still have pretty extraordinary labor markets.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Saul Martinez,"So, if you could just give us a little bit more color on just your expectations on credit losses and whether there's maybe a little bit more risk than we're thinking in terms of losses trending to something that is a bit higher than what we normally, or what are more normalized levels?",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Mark Mason,"So, let me start on that, and then, Jane, if you want to chime in, that's fine.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Mark Mason,I think what I'd point you to is page 24 in the deck that we have because it gives you a nice snapshot of how both the loss rates have been trending but also how the delinquencies have been trending.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Mark Mason,"And you can see that the delinquencies have been trending up, and that kind of gives us a good indication of where loss rates are likely to trend in the next quarter or so.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Mark Mason,"And so, at 2.72% on Branded Cards and 4.53% on Retail Services, we can see that we're likely to end up at about that normalized rate by the end of the year getting up to the 3-3.25%, 5-5.50% pre-COVID normalized NCL rates.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Mark Mason,"Our expectation is that as we go into 2024, to the point that you've made, depending on the macro environment, we're likely to see this tick up above those pre-COVID normalized rates, as we see a slowdown in the economy, again, subject to what the macro looks like, before then kind of settling down at some point, down the path.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Mark Mason,"And so, yes, we do see that tick up.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Mark Mason,"This is again as advertised, so to speak, as we would have expected.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Mark Mason,"And we have reserves, significant reserves for both of these portfolios to account for those loss expectations.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Mark Mason,"So, in Branded Cards, we sit with an ACL to loan reserve of 6.3%, and Retail Services, we have 11%.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Mark Mason,Jane mentioned earlier that the losses in Retail Services ultimately get shared with partners.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Mark Mason,"And so, while we would expect this to normalize and mature, so to speak, we feel very well-reserved for what that might look like.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Jane Fraser,And our portfolio is very prime.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Jane Fraser,"I mean, this is not the old Citi.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Jane Fraser,It's very different in terms of our consumer credit exposure.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Jane Fraser,"And I think what you're hearing from us is, this should all be very manageable.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Jane Fraser,"We're not, there's no alarm bells going off at Citi around this.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Jane Fraser,We're being prudent.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Jane Fraser,We're being conservative around pieces and responsible on it.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Jane Fraser,But there's no alarm bells ringing.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Jane Fraser,And I think that there may be a bit of a disconnect from some of the questions out there versus how we're feeling.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Jane Fraser,We're just not seeing the data that is overly concerning.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Jane Fraser,"This is all very manageable, and we're being prudent about it, as you'd expect us to be.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Operator,And our next question comes from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Jane Fraser,"Yeah, look, we remain confident around our ability to hit these targets.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Jane Fraser,"We've got, you heard me talk earlier around the revenue growth and what are some of the tailwinds that we've got behind us as well as the core strategy and the drivers that we're in control of and that we've been investing behind to achieve.",revenue,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Jane Fraser,"So, our strategy is unchanged, we're confident it will drive the revenue growth of 4% to 5%.",revenue,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Jane Fraser,"It's not the primary purpose, but the org simplification is the third driver of the expense reductions that we've talked about.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Jane Fraser,"And I would also say that when you look at revenue, expenses, and the targets we've laid out at Investor Day, we've certainly had plenty of headwinds in macro, regulatory, geopolitics in the last couple of years.",revenue,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Jane Fraser,"We have delivered on what we said we would do in the revenue, in the expense guidance, and on the strategy.",revenue,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Jane Fraser,We've made adaptions along the way as we've needed to.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Jane Fraser,"But I think that's the piece that we're also really trying to drive into the firm is a culture of we will do what we say we will do, and we'll adapt accordingly to different areas.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Jane Fraser,"Mark talked about adapting to the capital requirements, depending on what they are.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Jane Fraser,"We have other levers that we can pull, capital allocation, management buffer, DTA.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Jane Fraser,But my message to our investors is we're just building a proof point.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Jane Fraser,This is a relentless execution.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Jane Fraser,Look at that strategy scorecard page at the beginning of the deck there.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Jane Fraser,"We've achieved a lot and there is a lot going on, and we're getting a lot done.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Jane Fraser,"We don't pretend we're at the end of the road there, we're there yet.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Jane Fraser,But we're getting done what we said we'd do and building up those proof points so that you can see us achieve those return targets.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Jane Fraser,"Anything to add, Mark?",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Mark Mason,"As you said, building credibility and being transparent, right?",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Mark Mason,"So, we're going to keep delivering on the proof points, and we're going to be transparent about how and when and how we're going to achieve it.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,

2023,Q3,Gerard Cassidy,I was just curious on the corporate loans in North America there was an uptick.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Gerard Cassidy,"Again, I know relative to the portfolio, it's not that big.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,

2023,Q3,Mark Mason,"We did see an uptick, as you point out, in the reserves.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Mark Mason,That was really driven by some country rating adjustments that were made.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Mark Mason,"And then we did see an increase in the NALs, the non-accrual loans.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Mark Mason,"And that was really one or two names and one in North America, one in EMEA.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q3,Mark Mason,Both of them are current.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,

2024,Q3,Operator,Your line is now open.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Operator,Please go ahead.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Glenn Schorr,Good guidance.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Glenn Schorr,I appreciate it.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Glenn Schorr,"I'm curious on the card losses in Retail financial services, if you could talk to like, the 2024 exit rate seems like it will be higher than the full year guide at 6.25%.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Glenn Schorr,Maybe you could talk to the trajectory there and then the huge reserves that you have built in there and anything you can tell us about the portfolios so we can keep expectations in the right spot.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Mark Mason,"Yeah, sure.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Mark Mason,Why don't I take that.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Mark Mason,So a couple things.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Mark Mason,"So, one, I think that on Retail Services you're seeing a couple of things kind of play out.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Mark Mason,"So, one, you're seeing kind of spend volumes trend down a bit.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Mark Mason,You are seeing payment rates come down as well.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Mark Mason,That obviously is fueling the average interest earning balance growth that we're seeing.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Mark Mason,"And then you are also seeing with the spend volume come down, there's a denominator effect that plays through which pushes up obviously the loss rates that we're seeing.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Mark Mason,"That still in the quarter is in line with our guidance but in light of what we saw earlier in the year and normal seasonality, we would expect that number to be on the higher end of that range and likely higher in the fourth quarter, but the higher in the fourth quarter again depends on what traffic is like and what the holiday spending season looks like through the end of the year.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Mark Mason,I would say the reserve levels we have are very healthy as it relates to this portfolio.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Mark Mason,I think in the back of the deck we show kind of the reserve to loan ratio at about 11.7% or so.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Mark Mason,So well-reserved for the Retail Services portfolio in light of the environment that we're in.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Mark Mason,"Similarly, we are seeing the stabilization from a delinquency point of view across both portfolios kind of play through and so net-net, we are obviously actively managing this.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Mark Mason,"The retail partner activity is a critical component of it and that will drive fourth quarter activity or levels, but we do feel as if we'll end up on the higher end of the range here.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Glenn Schorr,"Just one quickie On your partnership with Apollo, very interesting and in line with a lot of other things we've seen.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Glenn Schorr,"Curious on how you thought about going with one specific partner versus a group and then more importantly, are there other parts of the franchise that could benefit with stronger ties to private markets, I'm thinking specifically in the asset-backed world.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Glenn Schorr,Appreciate it.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Jane Fraser,So we're delighted to partner with Apollo because what this does is it's uniting our comprehensive banking reach and expertise together and it's enabling us to offer our clients more innovative and tailored financing solutions.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Jane Fraser,There will be some other partners involved in this as well.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Jane Fraser,Mubadala is another participant in this.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Jane Fraser,"And when we look at this, it's very, very beneficial for our clients.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Jane Fraser,"We're always looking at how we can best serve our clients, give them the most options and this platform enhances corporate and sponsor clients access to the private lending capital pool at real scale in $25 billion is a very sizable partnership here and it provides funding certainty and strategic transactions.",billion,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Jane Fraser,"It's exclusive for LBOs, non-investment grade in the US.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Jane Fraser,"The US is obviously the bulk of the private credit market, it’s the behemoth globally.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Jane Fraser,It would be great to see that market developing in Europe and it wouldn't surprise me to see us doing more partnerships and other pieces going forward.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Operator,Our next question will come from Ebrahim Poonawala with Bank of America.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Operator,Your line is now open.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Operator,Please go ahead.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Ebrahim Poonawala,"I guess maybe, Mark, for you, like looking at slide 7 on NII, and maybe we can break it down into Markets and ex-Markets.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Ebrahim Poonawala,"In the ex-Markets NII, $11.96 billion this quarter, based on what you've said, the back book repricing, deposit flex, is it safe to conclude that the ex-Markets NII bottomed in 2Q 2024?",billion,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Ebrahim Poonawala,"And I noticed the securities yield actually went lower, 7 bps quarter-over-quarter.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Ebrahim Poonawala,So was there something one-off that impacted the yield this quarter relative to the expectations you outlined earlier?,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Mark Mason,"So when you look at slide 7, you got a couple of things playing through.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Mark Mason,"So your point around the low number, the low print, $11.46 billion in the second quarter, that really is a combination relative to first quarter of FX translation, some seasonally lower card balances, and lower interest payments in Argentina playing through that sequential 1Q to 2Q.",billion,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Mark Mason,"The third quarter, as I mentioned earlier, is really a by-product of volumes on the lending side and spreads, deposit spreads in Services and Wealth and I think that I've already given kind of the guide for the fourth quarter where that is likely to be flat.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Mark Mason,But I think it's important to just remind everyone of the headwinds and tailwinds that play through this NII line.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Mark Mason,"And from a tailwind point of view, I would expect to see continued volume from loans, USPB in particular but also Services and we're talking ex-Markets, so Services.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Mark Mason,"I'd also expect to see continued benefit from the reinvestment of securities at higher yields and then we're actively managing beta as it relates to with our clients and if you think about kind of what we saw in the uptick of rates, we're actively managing that on the down tick as it relates to our institutional clients.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Mark Mason,I think the other point here is let's not forget that our interest rate sensitivity skews more towards non-US and so a lot of what we think about and talk about tends to be how US rates move and the betas around that.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Mark Mason,We're still going to have a bit of beta catch-up outside of the US and so that's one of the headwinds there as well as the Legacy Franchise exits.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Mark Mason,"So you've got this long-winded way of saying, I do expect flat into the fourth quarter.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Mark Mason,I'm not going to give guidance for 2025.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Mark Mason,"But what I will say is to keep the growth momentum to get to our medium-term targets, that's 4% to 5% of a CAGR and that's going to be a combination of NII and NIR but skewing NIR.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Mark Mason,And I want to point that out because the third quarter and the year-to-date numbers that you see in our performance shows very strong fee NIR growth across each of these five businesses and I don't want to lose sight of that as you all really try to get a handle on how we get to that medium term.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Mark Mason,We're evidencing that shift towards more fee revenue as we speak.,revenue,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Mark Mason,"So I'll stop there, but I think that's important and hopefully I've answered your question around the NII forecast here.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Ebrahim Poonawala,That's helpful.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Ebrahim Poonawala,And agreed on the fee momentum.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Ebrahim Poonawala,Just one quick on the Wealth segment.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Ebrahim Poonawala,"We've seen a considerable progress year-to-date in terms of going from zero ROE to about 8.5% RoTCE, significant operating leverage.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Ebrahim Poonawala,I think I heard Jane say that momentum should continue.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Ebrahim Poonawala,"Is it fair to assume that RoTCE remains, like Wealth remains a positive story as we think about how Citi's ROE continues to improve from here as we get towards the target?",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Ebrahim Poonawala,Any color on the Wealth side would be helpful.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Jane Fraser,I think we're all very pleased to see the progress on the strategy we laid out at Investor Day.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Jane Fraser,The Wealth target we have in the medium term is 15% to 20% and with that a 25% to 30% operating margin and we're making steady progress there.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Jane Fraser,I think the first piece was putting the pieces of the global wealth organization together and now we're focused on positioning for growth and reshaping the business to deliver the returns that we all expect.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Jane Fraser,A very important part of that is shifting our mix by growing investments.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Jane Fraser,We had 24% growth in client investment assets this quarter.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Jane Fraser,I would call that a good start to realizing the potential that we have here.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Jane Fraser,"And at the same time, Andy continues to right-size our expense base and drive productivity.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Jane Fraser,Our advisor productivity increased over 50% in Citigold North America.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Jane Fraser,So a number of different areas that he's focused on so that we can continue to grow the investment space including some important new talent that we've been bringing in that I'm sure you've noticed.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Operator,Our next question will come from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Operator,Your line is now open.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Operator,Please go ahead.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Mike Mayo,"What assurance can you give that Citi can both meet its 2026 expense guide, the $51 billion to $53 billion and I note the year-to-date run rate implies $54 billion.",billion,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Mike Mayo,So getting from that $54 billion run rate down to the $51 billion to $53 billion by 2026 and meet its regulatory targets.,billion,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Mike Mayo,"In other words, assurance that Citi can both walk and chew gum at the same time.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Mike Mayo,"And I guess I'd highlight as you know, on October 2 Senator Warren asked the OCC to impose growth restrictions because Citi is ""too big to manage.""",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,Yes,occ,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Mike Mayo,"I would assume you don't agree with that, but still the question that a lot of people have is what assurances can you give that an asset cap won't happen at Citigroup?",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Mark Mason,So why don't I start with your expense question and I'm sure Jane will chime in on some of the other parts of your question.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Mark Mason,"So, look, we put out medium term targets of $51 billion to $53 billion in 2026, revenue dependent, of course, and that's consistent with the target we gave of less than 60% efficiency ratio.","billion, revenue",yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Mark Mason,And we've got a target this year as you know on the high end of $53.8 billion [ex-FDIC special assessment and Civil Money Penalties].,billion,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,Yes,fdic,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Mark Mason,And so we've got to get from $53.8 billion down to $51 billion to $53 billion by 2026.,billion,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Mark Mason,I'm not giving guidance for 2025 but you can expect that that will likely glide down to that number.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Mark Mason,What's driving the reduction?,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,

2024,Q3,Mark Mason,We're out of nine of these consumer countries already.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Mark Mason,And we talk about starting to see efficiencies and benefits from the investments and the transformation and technology towards the end of 2026.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Mark Mason,And those are the three drivers that are important for us to continue to realize between now and 2026.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Mark Mason,Will there be headwinds?,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Mark Mason,"There will be, the transformation is a multiyear process.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Mark Mason,We're also investing in risk controls and regulatory spend to support improving our operations.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Mark Mason,"Of course, there will be headwinds but there will also be things that we shift away from.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Mark Mason,There will be tailwinds associated with it.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Mark Mason,Jane mentioned some of the productivity efforts that both Andy as well as Vis are pushing on.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Mark Mason,You look across these businesses and you see positive operating leverage across the board.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Mark Mason,"So that means that Andy Morton as well as Gonzalo are too looking at their cost structures, at expenses that they can take out or productivity that they might improve.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Mark Mason,And so there will be additional costs that we have to incur.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Mark Mason,We incurred additional costs this year.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,

2024,Q3,Jane Fraser,It enhances our risk and control environment.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Jane Fraser,And it's a strategic overhaul as we've talked about that goes well beyond the consent order to simplify and to strengthen Citi to the benefit of all of the stakeholders we have.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Jane Fraser,We are already a very different Citi today.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Jane Fraser,"We've made enormous change over the past three years, dramatically simpler business model, significant org change so we align our structure to that model.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Jane Fraser,"We now have a flatter organization with greater accountability and as Mark talked about through the investments in our transformation, we're focused on simplifying our operational model, modernizing our infrastructure risk and controls and all of that reduces risk as we go.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Jane Fraser,We're well on the way in executing the transformation plans.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Jane Fraser,We've made meaningful progress as was acknowledged publicly by one of our regulators and it's a wide range book of work.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Jane Fraser,"We've made significant strides in areas such as risk management, compliance and accountability and that's well beyond the big bodies of work about consolidating our platforms.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Jane Fraser,"So we had 1,250 retired since 2022 as Mark mentioned.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,

2024,Q3,Jane Fraser,Values trades on demand and at scale.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Jane Fraser,And we've embedded risk and controls into our performance management framework and tied that to compensation for the full firm.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Jane Fraser,So these are just giving you a flavor of these big body of work that we are executing and getting done.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,

2024,Q3,Jane Fraser,Where there are areas in which our execution is delayed against our original timelines as is the case with our data work.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Jane Fraser,"We take a step back, determine what we need to change in those areas and get back on track and make relevant tech and people investments.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Jane Fraser,"So I feel very confident about the strategy we've laid out for the firm, the deliberate path we're on, the huge progress we've already made, and that we will continue making with determination and with clarity going forward.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Mike Mayo,"So, just one follow-up.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Mike Mayo,"When, and you do have the amended consent order that's not new anymore, but is this a problem with your dealing with clients or is this an issue with giving the regulators the information that they need?",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Mike Mayo,"And just again, you don't, just to confirm, you don't have an asset cap now, is it fair to assume that you don't expect an asset cap any time soon or could you have an asset cap and we don't even know about that?",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Jane Fraser,"We don't have any problems dealing with our clients, quite the opposite.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Jane Fraser,"We're a source of strength for our clients in terms of the provision of their payments businesses, their trading businesses, their consumer credit businesses, all across the board.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Jane Fraser,So I would say quite the opposite.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Jane Fraser,We are a source of tremendous strength for them and you see that in the results of this quarter which were very pleasing across the board in every single one of our businesses.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Jane Fraser,We are working closely with our regulators.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Jane Fraser,We incorporate their feedback as well as our own lessons learned.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Jane Fraser,"If we fall behind in an element of the consent orders but do understand the breadth of the consent order work as I laid out and the meaningful progress we're making across multiple areas, and when we fall behind in an area we increase the investments needed and look at any lessons learned in the approach and address it.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Jane Fraser,So I feel very comfortable.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Mark Mason,"So again, we don't have – we're not talking about issues as it relates to client information, client data, client reporting.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Mark Mason,We're not talking about information as it relates to financials.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Mark Mason,"We're talking about regulatory reporting, all right.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Mark Mason,"And regulatory reporting as I've mentioned in prior calls, we're a global firm.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Mark Mason,"We've got over 11,000 regulatory reports and we're talking about ensuring that the data that we capture at trade entry is the data that's required to ultimately show up on these various regulatory reports in the way that we need it ensuring that we've got the proper controls on that front end so we don't have to do a lot of the reconciliation and manual adjustments to that data in order to get it how we needed in the report and ensuring we have standardized rules and controls around that process so that we can do it as efficiently as possible.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Mark Mason,But this is largely around ensuring that we improve those regulatory reports that we have to produce by starting with the underlying data that's required to do that.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Operator,Our next question will come from Jim Mitchell with Seaport Global.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Operator,Your line is now open.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Operator,Please go ahead.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Jim Mitchell,"Hey, good morning.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Jim Mitchell,"Mark, consensus expectations, and it's just another expense question in a different way.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Jim Mitchell,But consensus has you not hitting your revenue growth targets and you're certainly free to disagree and I think that's fine.,revenue,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Jim Mitchell,But they also have your expenses at the high end of your $51 billion to $53 billion range in 2026.,billion,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Jim Mitchell,"I guess, does that make sense or do you feel confident that if revenues do sort of disappoint your targets that you could come in at the – you should or can come in at the lower end of that range to help get to your RoTCE target.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Mark Mason,Yeah.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Mark Mason,"So, let's take it in pieces.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Mark Mason,"So I think – the first thing is that, I think Jane and I have been very consistent with trying to give guidance on full year performance for the past couple years and we've largely actually delivered on that guidance.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Mark Mason,"If you look at the top line growth since Investor Day, it's largely consistent with what we talked about in the medium term.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Mark Mason,"If you look at the expense guidance that we've given, largely consistent with that including this year.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Mark Mason,"Even as I look at the $80 billion to $81 billion revenue guidance we gave for the year, and you look at the $60.6 billion that we've done year-to-date, and you think about what we have to deliver in order to hit that target, that is achievable particularly when you remember that we had a large Argentina devaluation last year.","billion, revenue",yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Mark Mason,That fee momentum required in the fourth quarter is very achievable and we believe that we will obviously hit the high end of the [expense] range for 2024.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Mark Mason,"As I think about that outer year period and the guidance that we gave there, look, you all want proof points before you actually believe that we can deliver on that medium term target.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Mark Mason,I'm pointing you to proof points.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Mark Mason,"I'm hopeful that as you see those proof points through 2024, full year and each of the quarters, that you will start to believe in that revenue momentum that's required in the medium term.",revenue,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Mark Mason,The fee revenue is a very good indicator.,revenue,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Mark Mason,What we delivered this year and this quarter is a very good indicator of the momentum we should see across these businesses in the next couple years.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Mark Mason,"I also hope that you would then see that as we deliver on the expense target that we have a path to continuing to deliver on the medium-term expense target, the drivers of which I mentioned earlier.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Mark Mason,"Yes, if revenues come in short of the target that we've set for ourselves, you would naturally expect for the volume and transaction related expenses and compensation expenses to come down in a commensurate way with that revenue decline and you would also expect that we would look to see if there are other productivity opportunities that we can tease out in order to still deliver on that operating efficiency target that we've set for ourselves.",revenue,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Jim Mitchell,I appreciate it.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Jim Mitchell,"And maybe just as a follow-up on the capital question, I guess one thing that's been a bit of a headwind over the last year has been sort of growth from the DTA deductions.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Jim Mitchell,Do we start to see that become a tailwind again?,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Jim Mitchell,How do we think about that accreting back into capital over the next couple of years?,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Mark Mason,Yeah.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Mark Mason,"Look, the main driver of our DTA utilization will be driving higher income in the US.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Mark Mason,"That's going to be the major driver and as we think about – so as you think about each of the strategies that Jane has described for our business, you will often hear the importance of winning in the US.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Mark Mason,"You'll hear it as it relates to Banking and the activity that we saw, the strong performance we saw this quarter in Vis’s world, you hear it as it relates to the Wealth business and the importance of us growing investments particularly in North America.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Mark Mason,You see it in USPB which is largely a US focused business.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Mark Mason,"That DTA utilization is about us increasing net income or higher net income in the US and as we work to execute on our client driven strategy, we are looking for opportunities to do that.",net income,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Mark Mason,We're incenting the business to drive that momentum and that's what's going to give us a higher utilization on a quarter by quarter in the coming years.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Operator,Our next question will come from Erika Najarian with UBS.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Operator,Your line is now open.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Operator,Please go ahead.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Erika Najarian,I think we've slid over to the afternoon.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Erika Najarian,"The first one is for you, Jane.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Erika Najarian,"As I speak with longer term investors, they often offer the commentary that clearly the path from the 7% RoTCE this quarter to the 11% to 12% hopefully will be bridged and to be able to initiate a position before that progress is made, they really sort of want to see more capital optimization.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Erika Najarian,And this question is not really the same question I ask you about buybacks every quarter but really maybe a progress update on Banamex.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Erika Najarian,So there is chatter in the market about Banamex needed to have four quarters of separate financials before being IPOed and I'm wondering if you could give us specific progress on how that's going?,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Erika Najarian,"And Mark, maybe remind us on what Banamex's contribution is as we think about the unlocking that excess capital versus taking it out of the P&L.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Jane Fraser,Yeah.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Jane Fraser,"I'd be delighted to, Erika.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Jane Fraser,And I would also just before I jump into Banamex point to a laser focus on capital optimization.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Jane Fraser,"It's been a mantra for a long time in our Markets business, in Banking and a discipline that we've driven throughout the organization and I would say there isn't anyone at Citi that is not keenly aware of the focus around optimizing our capital.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Jane Fraser,"Returning to shareholders, particularly given where we're trading, and making sure that we drive to returns.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Jane Fraser,"So if I turn to Banamex, our singular focus right now is the separation of the two banks which we expect to complete in the fourth quarter of this year.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Jane Fraser,This has been an enormous body of work because we are creating effectively de novo Mexico's eighth largest bank.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Jane Fraser,We've just now gotten the core regulatory authorizations that we need to proceed with separation.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Jane Fraser,Although there are a few other approvals pending.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Jane Fraser,We are in the very final stages and are working with our clients to prepare them for this switchover later on in Q4.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Jane Fraser,"Once the separation is complete, we will turn our full attention to the IPO itself and the successful execution of the IPO is the highest priority for our Head of International, Ernesto Torres Cantú, to run Banamex.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Jane Fraser,"And our incoming Banamex Executive Chairman who starts this quarter, Ignacio Deschamps.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Jane Fraser,"We plan to be ready to IPO at the end of 2025 based on the factors that we can control but I think as Mark and I have always said, the timing is going to be driven by market conditions to ensure we maximize the shareholder value.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Jane Fraser,"And we're making the necessary investments to continue growing share and I was very pleased that Banamex outpaced the average market revenue growth year-to-date, good expense discipline being maintained despite the complex separation process and the environment.",revenue,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Jane Fraser,So I'm pleased with where we are and I hope that gives you a bit of a flavor of what the path ahead looks like.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Mark Mason,Yeah.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Mark Mason,"In terms of the second part of your question, a couple things.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Mark Mason,"So, one, we've been seeing good growth in our Mexico Consumer business.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Mark Mason,"We've also been investing in it appropriately so to make sure that we protect the strength of that franchise as we prepare it for separation, ultimately for the IPO.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Mark Mason,"Erika, if I understood your question right, if we turn to page 16 of the deck in the bottom right hand side, we show the P&L for Mexico Consumer for 2022 and 2023.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Mark Mason,And so you can see the contribution from a revenue and expense point of view so about $1.5 billion in 2023.,"billion, revenue",yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Mark Mason,And I think it's about $4 billion or so of TCE that we have associated with this business.,billion,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Mark Mason,"So that gives you some sense for the contribution, but it continues to perform quite well as we manage it through this process.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Erika Najarian,Perfect.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Erika Najarian,"And as a follow-up question, I'm sure it is frustrating for you to see the stock reaction in a quarter where you had PPNR strength and better expectations for net interest income in the fourth quarter.",net interest income,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Erika Najarian,"So maybe I'll frame the question this way for you, Mark.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Erika Najarian,"As we think about the gyrations in interest rate expectations globally, may be remind us sort of is it fair to assume that Citi is asset sensitive internationally and neutrally positioned domestically?",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Erika Najarian,How should we think about late fees?,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Erika Najarian,I know you told us that late fees going to $8 were part of your initial guide for the year.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Erika Najarian,"And additionally, I think perhaps because capital markets is so strong across the board, across all of your peers, maybe that's not why you're getting, ""credit for your strength this quarter"".",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Erika Najarian,"So as we look into 2025 and having NIR be that bigger contribution to your revenue CAGR, maybe walk us through what are the other sort of core fee strengths that we should look for other than FICC and Banking remaining strong and coming back that could bring you to that path to 2026.",revenue,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Mark Mason,There's a lot there.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Mark Mason,But thank you.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Mark Mason,"I would like to see the stock reacting much more favorably because this really has been a strong quarter for us and in fact as you mentioned, NII when you look through it, we've in fact taken our NII guidance up just a tad bit as we referenced that the full year would be slightly down versus modestly down with the fourth quarter that's flat to the third quarter and so that is an important takeaway.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Mark Mason,I mentioned the headwinds and tailwinds earlier and we shouldn't lose sight of those.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Mark Mason,"We will get lift from reinvesting the securities as those mature, we will continue to see volume growth and those are important drivers of tailwind activity for us.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Mark Mason,You rightfully mentioned our interest rate exposure analysis that we do on a quarterly basis that reflects the asset sensitivity of our business.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Mark Mason,"And last quarter it was about $1.6 billion or so of a negative, assuming 100 basis point decline across the curve, assuming a static balance sheet and cross-currencies.",billion,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Mark Mason,"And as you look at that asset sensitivity, again, you rightfully pointed out that we skew non-US in terms of the magnitude of that decline in NII should we see that parallel shift.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Mark Mason,"And in fact, it's as much as $1.3 billion or so of that $1.6 billion is non-US dollar related across 60 currencies.",billion,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Mark Mason,And so you'd have to see all of that move in tandem for that drag and the US dollar drag is about $300 million assuming 100 basis point shift and that's been coming down.,million,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Mark Mason,"If you look back over the quarters, we've been thoughtfully managing that down and that's down to about $300 million number.",million,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Mark Mason,"I would expect when we print the third quarter Q, it will be down a bit more.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Mark Mason,"And so, again, we are asset sensitive but it does skew outside of the US and thank you for asking the question because I think it's important to remind our investors and analysts of that dynamic which in many ways may be different from that of other Institutions.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Mark Mason,"In terms of the late fees, we did say that we were including late fees in our assumptions, in our outlook that we've given.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Mark Mason,"I'll state the obvious Erika, which is that we want people to obviously pay on time and we do everything that we can to assist and ensure that they do that.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Mark Mason,"With that said, we don't have a definitive timeline on late fees, nor are we overly reliant on late fees to drive revenue for our firm.",revenue,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Mark Mason,And so it looks like that decisioning will likely kind of fall closer to sometime in 2025 and so there is a small adjustment in the last quarter of our revenue forecast but it's inside of the guidance that we gave and doesn't materially change that in any way.,revenue,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Mark Mason,"And then the last part of your question, I think, was around NIR and the fee revenue.",revenue,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Mark Mason,"And as I mentioned earlier, I'm not going to give guidance for 2025 but I think your question was around where are we likely to see continued momentum as it relates to fee revenue growth.",revenue,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Mark Mason,And I would start with Services where fees were up some 33% year-over-year and yes we should adjust for the Argentine Peso devaluation.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Mark Mason,"But even if you adjust for that it's double-digit, 11% year-over-year non-interest revenue growth.",revenue,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Mark Mason,And when you look at those drivers they've been consistently strong.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Mark Mason,"Cross-border transaction value up 8%, US dollar clearing volume up 7%, commercial card spend up 8%.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Mark Mason,In the supplement you'll see that it's mid to high single digit year-to-date growth across those KPIs as well.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Mark Mason,We expect that that will continue with our corporate clients and as we bring on new commercial clients as well.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Mark Mason,"I'll turn you to – if you look at Banking, we talked about already so I won't kind of lean into that too much but except to highlight a really strong quarter in Banking, in Investment Banking fees, in particular, the rebound that we've been talking about but importantly us capturing share in that rebound and these important partnerships that position us well as sponsors start to lean back into the market the investments that we've been making in talent, in sectors we need to strengthen.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Mark Mason,All of those things are going to play to continued fee momentum as we go into 2025.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Mark Mason,"Wealth, again, really strong performance this quarter with revenues up 9%.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Mark Mason,"But look at the client investment assets, up 24%.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Mark Mason,The client balances up 14%.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Mark Mason,That's driving fee momentum and it's a keen area of focus for Andy and that team that he's pulled together and it's a real opportunity for us given the $5 trillion or so of assets that our clients hold away from us and we're better positioning ourselves to capture that.,trillion,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Mark Mason,"And then finally, you can see kind of continued momentum on USPB but it's across the board is what I'm saying, Erika, in terms of that fee momentum and it is important.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Mark Mason,It's an important aspect as we think about getting to those medium term targets and that 4% to 5% revenue.,revenue,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Operator,Our next question will come from Gerard Cassidy with RBC.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Operator,Your line is now open.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Operator,Please go ahead.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Gerard Cassidy,"Mark, you touched on in your prepared comments about growing the US Personal Banking RoTCE to higher levels.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Gerard Cassidy,And you mentioned two items.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Gerard Cassidy,"One, innovative products and the normalization of credit costs.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Gerard Cassidy,Can you elaborate on those two items that will be contributing to the driver aside from the efficiency improvement that you also touched on?,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Mark Mason,"Yeah, sure.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Mark Mason,So obviously USPB is a combination of the cards businesses that we have in the Retail Banking business and that cards portfolio has both Branded as well as Retail Services as part of it.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Mark Mason,"And even within Branded, we have proprietary cards where we frankly have been looking to how we can come up with new innovative products.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Mark Mason,One example of product innovation is the recent refresh that we did of our Strata Premier Card which was designed to drive acquisition and engagement with a new rewards offering.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Mark Mason,And with that acquisitions are up some 7% both quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year for Branded Cards so that's an example of product innovation.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Mark Mason,"Another one is we also launched FlexPay at Costco a few quarters ago and you can see good instalment loan growth as a consequence of that, up some 15% or so.",loan growth,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Mark Mason,"And so that type of product creation is important to acquisitions, it's important to ensuring the card stays top of wallet and important to driving some of that top line performance.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Mark Mason,"And then the other thing that I mentioned, you're right was around cost of credit and that really is the continued normalization of cost of credit.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Mark Mason,I mentioned a couple of times now the idea that multiple vintages are maturing at the same time.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Mark Mason,And that has to play through for us to kind of see a more normal level of credit and that will be important to the returns.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Mark Mason,"And again, we are starting to see stabilization in both the cost of credit line but also in delinquencies and that's a good indicator for us.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Gerard Cassidy,Very good.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Gerard Cassidy,And then just following up on credit.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Gerard Cassidy,"In the Banking division, you guys mentioned the cost of credit was, I think, $177 million due to ACL build of $141 million.",million,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Gerard Cassidy,And it was due to a change in the mix in the portfolio.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Gerard Cassidy,Can you share with us what that mix change was that drove this provision?,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Mark Mason,It's a mix of kind of different asset classes and clients that we've lent against.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Mark Mason,There's nothing material or significant in that number.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Mark Mason,When you look at the nonaccrual loans that ratio still 31 basis points.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Mark Mason,So it's a mix change of our exposures but nothing material there.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Jane Fraser,And we continue to see a very healthy corporate sector really across the world.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Operator,Our next question will come from the line of Vivek Juneja with JPMorgan.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Operator,Your line is now open.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Operator,Please go ahead.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Vivek Juneja,"Two questions, Jane and Mark.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Vivek Juneja,One is on expenses and the other is on your response to the asset cap question before.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Vivek Juneja,"So first one, expenses, an easier one.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Vivek Juneja,Earlier in the year you had said you expect about $700 million to $1 billion of severance charges in the $53.5 billion to $53.8 billion.,"billion, million",no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Vivek Juneja,Did you have any in the third quarter?,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Vivek Juneja,Expect any if the fourth?,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Vivek Juneja,And do you expect to be done with those this year or any to continue into next year too?,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Mark Mason,Yeah.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Mark Mason,So that number was a combination of restructuring charges and severance charges or repositioning charges and we breakout obviously restructuring so that you can see those.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Mark Mason,And this restructuring component was largely driven by the org simplification.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Mark Mason,That will be done this year.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Mark Mason,The normal severance or repositioning charges that we take as a normal course of BAU you would expect that to occur in any year and it certainly will be part of 2025 and 2026 going forward.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Mark Mason,We did have some this quarter.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Mark Mason,"I would expect that we will have some next quarter, but I don't see us being outside of by any stretch the range that I gave and again the range was for the combination of both.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Vivek Juneja,"And shifting to the asset cap question, Jane and Mark, we didn't hear a clear answer on, A, do you have an asset cap?",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Vivek Juneja,"And B, even if you don't, what is the effective implication or impact of what the regulators have said?",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Vivek Juneja,"And you don't expect anything meaningful, Jane, that will impact business like there was this new story about China, some license that you didn't get approved by the regulators.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Vivek Juneja,Anything more meaningful like that that might be occurring that may be...,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Jane Fraser,"Absolutely – let me be crystal clear, absolutely nothing.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Vivek Juneja,Great.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Operator,Our next question will come from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Operator,Your line is now open.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,

2024,Q3,Operator,MATT O',,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Connor,Just a couple of clarification questions.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Connor,"I guess first on Banamex, are you on track to still IPO it the fourth quarter of next year or does it just get pushed out by a quarter with the legal separation taking a little bit longer?",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Jane Fraser,"Look, I think as I mentioned in response to Erika's question, we plan to be ready to IPO at the end of 2025 based on the factors we can control.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Jane Fraser,The timing is going to get driven by how we maximize shareholder value and that will be market conditions.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Jane Fraser,So that's where we stand.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Jane Fraser,MATT O',,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Connor,"I think that means by the end of 2025, you talk about 1Q 2026, that was kind of my clarification question on that.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Connor,I thought you needed four quarters after you legally separated it to officially IPO it.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Jane Fraser,We believe as we stand at the moment we would be ready to IPO at the end of 2025.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Jane Fraser,"It's much more a focus on what the market conditions at that point will be and Mark and I are very, very much focused on the shareholder value and maximizing that over – rushing over one quarter versus another quarter.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Mark Mason,"And there's no hard rule on – sorry, go ahead.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Jane Fraser,"Yes, there isn't a hard rule on you have to have got four quarters after you have separated.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Jane Fraser,MATT O',,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Connor,I see.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Connor,That's super helpful.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Connor,"We just haven't had that many of these, so that's helpful.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Connor,And then just separately I think in the prepared remarks you guys mentioned a modest provision within Services for some of the unremitted corporate dividends and I just wanted to clarify that and what country is that.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Connor,"And I guess I thought there wasn't really much liability to you guys from that, so any clarification on that.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Connor,"I know it's a small amount, but that would be helpful.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Mark Mason,It's a small amount.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Mark Mason,"In the back of the deck, we have a page on Russia exposure.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Mark Mason,It's related to that.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Mark Mason,MATT O',,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Connor,"But still feel like there's not risk to you guys from all those kind of trapped dividends, I guess why take a small reserve if there's legally no risk to you guys?",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Mark Mason,"Well, it's the way we treat the exposure there.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Mark Mason,We're following the guidelines on how we need to treat exposures in the country that we aren't able to distribute to clients but we actually have to hold on their behalf.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Mark Mason,And so we have to book a reserve associated with that and so we do that.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Mark Mason,We obviously show on the page what the exposure is in the event of a loss of control and you can kind of see how that ultimately nets out but we're following the appropriate guidelines for what's required for reserves of that nature.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Mark Mason,MATT O',,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Connor,Got it.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Mark Mason,Yeah.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Operator,Our next question comes from the line of Ryan Kenny with Morgan Stanley.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Operator,Your line is now open.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Operator,Please go ahead.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Ryan Kenny,Hey.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Ryan Kenny,I have one for Mark.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Ryan Kenny,So you mentioned that Services NII is a tailwind as rates decline.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Ryan Kenny,Can you just unpack how that happens?,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Ryan Kenny,Is there any benefit from swap roll-off or a floating swap that we should be thinking about that's embedded in that statement?,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Mark Mason,There are a couple of things kind of to keep in mind on the Services business.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Mark Mason,"So, one is, is obviously this is a client business.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Mark Mason,It's not just a deposit taking business and so how we think about pricing to those client becomes really important.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Mark Mason,You've got the US and non-US dynamic that's playing through.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Mark Mason,"For institutional clients, we've largely been holding to the higher betas that we saw as rates have ticked up.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Mark Mason,"Again, with the relationship in mind.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Mark Mason,And we have some offsetting pressure outside of the US as those betas kind of catch up.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Mark Mason,But I think importantly you also heard me mention the reinvestment into securities at higher yields and that reinvestment or those higher yields ultimately play out through the businesses and so that will show up as part of kind of NII as we think about Services but the other businesses as well.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Mark Mason,And so those are important components of the NII story for Services.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Mark Mason,"I think when you look at the in-quarter performance and [TTS] NII is down 5%, a big part of that is driven by the Argentina rates movement in the quarter versus last year, so lower rates we're earning in Argentina playing through that line particularly in this quarter.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Mark Mason,"If you adjusted for that on the NII line, it would be flat to slightly a little bit better.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Mark Mason,So that's really what it is.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Mark Mason,It's kind of management of client relationships as well as the higher earnings on reinvested securities contributing to that as well as volume from operating account growth that we expect.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Operator,Our next question comes from the line of Saul Martinez with HSBC.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,

2024,Q3,Saul Martinez,"Hey, guys.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Saul Martinez,Couple quick questions.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Saul Martinez,"First, just a follow-up on Banamex.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Saul Martinez,"Jane, as you know, there are concerns about judicial reform in Mexico and the implications for rule of law and Mexican asset prices have suffered as a result.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Saul Martinez,I think the largest Mexican bank trades at something in the neighborhood of seven times earnings.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Saul Martinez,"If market conditions don't improve and Mexican asset prices remain depressed and these concerns persist, then what?",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Saul Martinez,"I mean, do you just wait until market conditions improve or how do you think about this process in the context of what seems to be a deteriorating macro backdrop for Mexico.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Jane Fraser,Yeah.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Jane Fraser,"We've got to wait and see what the market conditions will be but the North Star for me and for Mark is crystal clear, it is optimizing and maximizing our shareholder value.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Jane Fraser,So if the conditions are not appropriate at that time then we will wait until they are.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Jane Fraser,"In the meantime, the business is performing well.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Jane Fraser,It's accretive to our returns.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Jane Fraser,It's not a drag here in any shape or form so there is no need to rush for a suboptimal result here.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Jane Fraser,"But we will IPO and we will exit Banamex, but we won't do that in a reckless manner.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Jane Fraser,We will be disciplined about it as you would expect us to be and as I think we're demonstrating that we are on multiple different dimensions.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Saul Martinez,Fair enough.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Saul Martinez,"And then I guess a follow-up on the US Personal Banking, RoTCE improvement and the normalization of the cost of credit seems to be a big component of that.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Saul Martinez,But Mark can you just remind us where you are in terms of cost of credit versus what you would think a more normalized level is for Branded Cards and Retail Services.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Saul Martinez,I guess how much of a tailwind does a more normalized credit environment entail in terms of credit cost?,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Mark Mason,"Again, I don't want to get into 2025 at this stage.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Mark Mason,"I assure you, we will give more color and commentary on that as we get into the fourth quarter earnings in January.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Mark Mason,"What I will say again, as you think about these businesses, we do see continued top line – we do expect continued top line momentum.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Mark Mason,"We've had eight consecutive quarters of positive operating leverage in USPB, 49% [efficiency ratio] this quarter.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Mark Mason,So we're managing the expense base well.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Mark Mason,We think there's more upside to the top line.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Mark Mason,"We're very focused on growth across the portfolios and I do think that cost of credit again, if for no other reason but the compounding effect of those vintages maturing as well as kind of inflation starting to come off, rates trickling down, that should be better for the consumer and should start to play out in both the macroeconomic scenarios that we run for CECL purposes but also ultimately in delinquencies and NCLs and we're starting to see that improvement in delinquencies and its stabilization already somewhat.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Mark Mason,So I don't want to get into guidance.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Mark Mason,But that's kind of how I think about the drivers or contributors to improve returns over the medium term.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Operator,Our next question will come from the line of Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Operator,Your line is now open.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Operator,Please go ahead.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Mike Mayo,Thanks for the clarification on the asset cap question that I asked earlier.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Mike Mayo,"And I know you are limited in how much you can say about regulators but just be clear, because a lot of e-mail traffic going back, you did say there is no asset cap and you don't expect one and you don't expect other additional actions at this time?",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Jane Fraser,Correct.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,

2024,Q3,Mike Mayo,"But I'm just wondering – and you have consolidated systems apps, layers, bureaucracy and you're divesting lots of activities.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Mike Mayo,"So it's just even the amended consent order was surprising because you have taken so many efforts and if you should have had an amended consent order or other actions, they probably should have been in place one, five, 10 or literally 20 years ago.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Mike Mayo,And so that's just confusing on the outside.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Mike Mayo,"So with that said, is this a matter of spending more money or about doing these tasks more intelligently?",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,

2024,Q3,Jane Fraser,So let me break it down to a couple of pieces.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Jane Fraser,"So I start off just remind everyone the consent orders are very, very broad and the action that was taken was because we're behind in a narrower area which is the data particularly regarding our regulatory reporting where we're behind is the main area of focus.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Jane Fraser,We moved swiftly to address it.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,

2024,Q3,Jane Fraser,"And as you say, Mike, I listed a number of areas of progress and trying to make it as tangible as we can, given what we can and can't say as this is supervisory.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Jane Fraser,I'm pleased that our businesses continue to improve their performance while the transformation is going on.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Jane Fraser,"They're the two priorities we have this year so I think effectively, yes, we can walk and chew gum at the same time and the huge benefit of all of the simplification on the business, on the organization, the other efforts, is making it easier for us to execute and be very focused.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Jane Fraser,"And well maybe, Mark, I’ll pass it over to you.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Mark Mason,"I think your question's helpful in the sense that you said is it kind of a rethink on our approach or is it the need to spend more money and one of the things that we've done, Mike, is take a step back and look at how we've been approaching data, for example.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Mark Mason,"So this is – and we are going to make – we have made some changes to our approach and those changes relate to how we get after resolving data issues that are identified ensuring that there's engagement from the front end business, from the functions that are most relevant and that there's consideration for what's required on reg reporting in order for us to get that process streamlined and correct.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Mark Mason,"And so there are aspects of this that require a change in our approach and we've been taking that change, making that change rather, and we'll make more changes accordingly as we've taken that step back and there are aspects of it that require at a minimum review of what is causing either the delay or us not moving at the pace that we would like to move or that our regulators would like.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Mark Mason,And that is in fact what the resource review plan was that was in the amended consent order.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Mark Mason,It was basically a statement saying that you need to ensure that you have sufficient resources and that they're allocated towards achieving the timely and sustainable compliance.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Mark Mason,And so part of our process is in fact that.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Mark Mason,"Taking a regular review of what is on track in the way of our milestones and deliverables where we see things that are being delayed or going red, what is the underlying root cause for why.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Mark Mason,Is it a resource issue where we need to put more dollars and people or technology to it?,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Mark Mason,Is it a process issue where we need to reconsider our approach?,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Mark Mason,"And on the other side of that root cause, taking action to fix it.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Mark Mason,And so your question is spot-on.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Mark Mason,"The answer is that in many instances it will be a little bit of both, but importantly our processes include that type of analysis and assessment so that we can get after the execution on this in an effective way.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Mark Mason,I hope that helps.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Jane Fraser,And all of this drives productivity and other benefits for our shareholders as well as making sure that we're strengthening Citi from the regulatory perspective.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,

2024,Q3,Mike Mayo,"And so, I hope that – I've used this analogy before, but hopefully you're selling the chairs and the desk and the silverware in the executive dining room to go ahead and buy back stock whenever you can.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q3,Jane Fraser,"It's clearly given where we are trading, we're very focused around the opportunities to buy back stock and mindful of the importance of it and equally, yes, we are proud of the performance of the franchise this quarter.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,

2021,Q4,Mark Mason,We obviously have a mix of US dollar and foreign currencies as well.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Mark Mason,"And when we run that analysis now assuming the balance sheet is static, that is the deposit levels, loan levels, et cetera, that delivers three times more than what we disclosed in the Q in the third quarter.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Mark Mason,So that's the $2.5 billion to $3 billion of Net Interest Income.,"billion, net interest income",yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Mark Mason,"So obviously retaining or assuming that the deposit levels stay the same allow us to generate more Net Interest Income, and that's a major driver in the number range or the range that I provided.",net interest income,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Mark Mason,"In terms of the forward look, I'm not going to give you guidance as you mentioned, but I think there are a couple things that are important to keep in mind that we're looking at for 2022.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Mark Mason,One is the drivers that we mentioned earlier.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Mark Mason,"So a lot of the underlying drivers in our franchise look very strong and are driving healthy fee revenue growth, and I would expect with an outlook for positive GDP that that's going to continue to play to our advantage in 2022.",revenue,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Mark Mason,The second thing I'd point out is the assumptions around interest rate hikes in 2022.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Mark Mason,"As many as three or four, depending on the economist view that you listen to, and that obviously is going to play to our favor as well when you think about the number of accrual businesses that we have whether it's our TTS franchise or our Private Bank, et cetera, et cetera.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Mark Mason,So those are important factors that impact the top line and that we expect to help contribute to some growth coming out of 2022.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Mark Mason,I mentioned the loan growth on the Branded Cards portfolio.,loan growth,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Mark Mason,"For cards, it's really going to be about payment rates and how they taper off, hopefully taper off.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Mark Mason,"They've been stubbornly high through all of 2021, so hopefully we start to see some of that taper off and we get a little bit of growth in average interest-earning balances in the back half of the year, but those are important factors that need to play through into 2022.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,John Mcdonald,Great.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,John Mcdonald,"And then just as a follow-up, as you're managing capital, you mentioned you'll return to some level of buybacks this quarter.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,John Mcdonald,"And you've got a lot of capital that you expect to free up in transactions that haven't happened yet, so I guess how are you kind of thinking about that future capital as something that you'll deploy as you get it as part of your long-term thinking but you're not planning on using that throughout this year, I assume?",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Mark Mason,"Yeah, so obviously, we look at capital planning with a, in the context of our strategy and our ability to actually deploy that capital, but to return as much excess capital as we can to our shareholders.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Mark Mason,"And so as we think about the divestitures which are underway as that capital frees up, we're going to factor that into the capital plan for the year and the quarter and where we can, we're going to return that to shareholders.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Mark Mason,So a number of deals are scheduled to close in 2022.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Mark Mason,"That will be part of our plan, and we'll be looking forward to taking those actions in the outer part of the year.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Operator,Your next question is from the line of Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Mike Mayo,Thank you for the new presentation.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,

2021,Q4,Mike Mayo,What's the most simple statement you can give on who and what Citigroup represents?,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Jane Fraser,"Oh, I love that question.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Jane Fraser,So I would say that our vision for Citi is to be the preeminent bank for institutions with cross-border needs.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Jane Fraser,"We'll be a leader in – global leader in wealth, a major player in consumer payments and lending in the home market, and that is Citi and our vision for it.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Jane Fraser,"It's a simpler firm, more focused, it's much better connected, it's certainly simpler to operate, characterized by a culture of excellence and accountability, and I think as I hope we've shown today one that should be easier for everybody to understand and fully aligned with our shareholders' interests.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Mike Mayo,"And along those lines, you're freeing up, what, about $11 billion of capital now, and intentions, Mark, I always hear you say you're going to invest in the business, you're going to do supply for growth and then you're going to buy back stock, but in terms of a stock price that's this low, I mean, the stock price relative to the financial index is one of the all-time lows.",billion,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Mike Mayo,Wouldn't you move buybacks up in the priority order?,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Mike Mayo,Or what else can you do or say to show that shareholders matter?,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Mike Mayo,"Jane, I mean, you've done so much on the E side.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Mike Mayo,"You've certainly done a lot on the S side, but the G in ESG when it relates to shareholders, shareholders have been left back for so long, just seeing what else you might be able to do or say as it relates to recognizing shareholders and their desire to have a stock price that does better.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Jane Fraser,"Our shareholders are an enormous priority for us, and, Mike, I know we need to make the bank for shareholderaligned and friendly, and we are doing so.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Jane Fraser,So let me give you four examples.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Jane Fraser,"Our strategy will generate, and we will return excess capital to shareholders, and as you say, given where the stock is trading, it makes buybacks highly attractive.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Jane Fraser,"Second, we're taking the structural and strategic decisions to put the bank in the best position to drive shareholder value, and you can see, we're executing, and we are delivering with urgency and we're very driven to get the valuation in a far higher place than it is today.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Jane Fraser,"Third, we're changing many elements of the financial reporting so it's easier for our shareholders to understand the bank and we're going to be as transparent as possible so you can measure our progress and results, and I think the structure that Mark laid out and I gave the high-level on will make that job much easier.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Jane Fraser,"And then finally, and a topic I know you've been quite vocal around, we are also making changes to compensation.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Jane Fraser,So more of our senior business leaders will be on the PSUs for this coming year.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Jane Fraser,"We've moved to 100% deferred stock versus a mix of stock and cash in the geographies that we're permitted to do so, and we're increasing the importance of returns in determining performance evaluations.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Jane Fraser,"There is a myriad of paths and lots of different actions that we're taking because our shareholders matter to us, and we want to get our valuation up to one that we think realizes its full potential.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Operator,Your next question is from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley..,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Betsy Graseck,So a couple of questions.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Betsy Graseck,"One, just thinking through the walk from where you are today in CET1 till the end of the year when you mentioned you'd be ending the year at 12%, you have some businesses that are exiting, which should reduce RWAs I would think, but then you've got debt buybacks as well coming through, and at the same time, I would expect that you'd probably want to grow your RWAs.",cet1,no,Yes,cet1,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Betsy Graseck,"I know your RWAs were down 5% Q2 and maybe that was a part of the reason why FICC was a little light, so could you help me understand just how we should think about that trajectory and the drivers of that CET1 change because it will have some impact on how we're thinking about the rev growth in the Markets business.",cet1,no,Yes,cet1,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Mark Mason,"Yeah, good question.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Mark Mason,"So we are looking at, obviously, how we continue to invest in the franchise, particularly where there are areas of growth.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Mark Mason,"At the same time, ensure that we're delivering buybacks for return to shareholders.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Mark Mason,"As I look at the CET1 ratio, we're ending the year at about 12.2%.",cet1,yes,Yes,cet1,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,Yes,cet1 ratio
2021,Q4,Mark Mason,"As you know, SACR kicks in or has kicked in on January 1.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Mark Mason,"We're ending, therefore, on January 1 at roughly around where our target is, and over the course of the year, we'll be able to absorb growth in the businesses where there's a need to do that while continuing to identify offsets to both SA-CCR, but also low-returning assets that we may have and ridding ourselves of those and generating income as well as the capital from the divestitures that we will be able to close throughout the course of the year.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Mark Mason,"And so as we look at that plan, the start of the year, which is close to our target, towards the end of 2022, we will have to build that back up to about 12% in order to absorb the GSIB headwind assuming there's no relief provided to that, which then kicks in at the beginning of 2023.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,Yes,gsib,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Mark Mason,"And so through the course of the year, we'll utilize through RWA, we'll free up capital and return capital to shareholders, we'll generate more earnings, but at the end of the year we'll need to kind of end on the higher end or towards that 12%.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Betsy Graseck,Do you have a sense as to how much the benefit to like GSIB or SCB should be from all the divestitures you're doing?,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,Yes,gsib,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Betsy Graseck,"I was actually thinking when I saw the Mexico news this week that maybe that was one of the reasons why you decided to exit the Mexico consumer businesses as potentially the pickup that you'd get since you mentioned, it makes you a simpler company and that should feed into SCB, I would think.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Mark Mason,"Yeah, it's not a major driver as to the decision, as Jane has kind of framed out, but it does factor into the points that you've raised.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Mark Mason,"So from a GSIB point of view, there's, I don't know, $31 billion or so of deposits that are tied to our Mexico consumer business.",billion,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,Yes,gsib,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Mark Mason,"That would drive about 10 basis points or so, or 10 points I should say on the GSIB score.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,Yes,gsib,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Mark Mason,"The total for the divestitures that we've earmarked, it's about $85 billion in deposits, and so you can do the math that we'd get some benefit from that.",billion,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Mark Mason,"You're right and we – I don't have numbers that I would share at this point in part because the fed has to run their analysis, but you're right from a CCAR point of view when you think about the stress capital buffer there's an impact to PPNR, but more importantly to stress losses that will play through as well.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,Yes,ccar,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Mark Mason,"As you know that impact as well as the deposit impact won't really come into play until we've closed on these transactions, but it certainly is a factor to how we think about the longer-term capital planning, and it certainly is something that I'm going to talk more about at Investor Day on March 2.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Betsy Graseck,"And the low-returning assets that you were talking about exiting, is that like – that's basically something like rates in the Fixed Income business and should we expect some impact there, or again, I'm just trying to tie together the 5% decline in RWAs and the comment that Fixed Income business was a little light this quarter.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Mark Mason,Yeah.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Mark Mason,"I'm not looking to be specific on where the low-returning assets we're getting out, but we're certainly looking at our markets franchise to see where those low-returning assets exist as well as to see where their client relationships that are single product and don't necessarily link across the franchise, and so this is something that Jane and I, along with Paco are keenly focused on.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Mark Mason,"We realize that while we've seen growth in markets and in FICC, it has come with growth in the balance sheet, and we want to make sure that we're optimizing the use of the capital.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Operator,Your next question is from the line of Erika Najarian with UBS.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Erika Najarian,"My first question is for Mark, please, and by the way, thank you so much for this new way of disclosing financials.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Erika Najarian,"I think this will be very helpful, and the NII sensitivity as well.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Mark Mason,Yeah.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Mark Mason,Great question.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Mark Mason,"You know, I'm not going to give guidance on 2022, but let me try and frame out how we're thinking about it, because I think it is important.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Mark Mason,Both Jane and I recognize that we've got – there's a lot of static we're getting.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Mark Mason,Excuse me.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Mark Mason,"So in terms of the expenses, we obviously have a large expense base.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Mark Mason,"We've seen growth play out this year, but I think there's some real opportunities over time to attack the expense base and that's exactly what we intend to do.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Mark Mason,"So if you think about the divestitures, I'll start there for a second.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Mark Mason,There's some $6.8 billion of expenses tied to divestitures.,billion,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Mark Mason,"As those divestitures get closed out, some of that will naturally go away.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Mark Mason,"The balance of that, which tends to be referred to as stranded costs, we're already putting in place a team to focus on attacking and driving out that stranded costs.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Mark Mason,The second point that I'll bring up around this is the transformation.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Mark Mason,The transformation has driven 3 percentage points of growth this year.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Mark Mason,"I do expect that there's more growth associated with that, particularly since we're still doing more hiring.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Mark Mason,There's more tech spend that will be required.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Mark Mason,"But the transformation over time will deliver efficiencies, will reduce the manual touchpoints, will drive straight through processing, and therefore, will allow for us to bring our expenses down.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Mark Mason,"And the final piece that I'll mention is the strategy, and so Jane mentioned in our strategy a focus on core businesses, and that's going to allow for us to look at the organizational structure and identify more simplification opportunities in the way we manage and run the firm.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Mark Mason,We do about $300 million to $400 million of productivity savings a quarter.,million,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Mark Mason,That's not enough.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Mark Mason,"We think there's more opportunity for efficiencies than that, and it's those opportunities that we're going to chase down in order to fund some of this investment spend that we expect in the next couple of years.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Mark Mason,More on that at Investor Day.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Erika Najarian,"Jane, this next question is for you.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,

2021,Q4,Erika Najarian,"How is your vision of Citi, what does it include in terms of your funding base?",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Erika Najarian,"There's a lot of conversation particularly in the beginning of a rising rate environment about the natural gap that you have to your largest US peers with regards to your naturally higher rate deposits, right?",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Erika Najarian,"And so how do you envision your funding base evolving over time, and do you have any interest in significantly building out your US retail deposit franchise?",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Jane Fraser,"So, Erika, we've got a pretty diverse funding base.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Jane Fraser,"When we look at it from the Institutional side, we've got the number-one TTS franchise globally and that has material funding from our cash management and dominant position in cash management there.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Jane Fraser,Our wealth franchise both from the ultra high net worth down to the affluent clients is also a source of material and very attractive deposits and funding for us.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Jane Fraser,"Obviously, we're making the exits on the international consumer banking front, and we've been focused in the retail bank in the US in driving digital deposit growth and continuing to make sure that that business generates a stable, low-cost funding for the firm here in the US and we'll expect to continue growing that going forward.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Operator,Your next question is from the line of Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Mike Mayo,That was sooner than I expected.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Mike Mayo,"Just to follow-up on the compensation changes, yes, that's good news that people are paid in stock instead of just cash and stock, but you had the new bonus arrangement.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Mike Mayo,"I did not think that was finalized, but as part of the new bonus arrangement based on the next three-year financial targets, is that still all cash, or is that cash and stock, or is that stock?",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Jane Fraser,I'm assuming you're referring to the transformation award.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Jane Fraser,"Is that correct, Mike?",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Jane Fraser,"Yeah, so that one, while it's paid in cash for the first two pieces, the last 50% is pegged to our three-year stock performance and we felt that that was the appropriate balance here.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Jane Fraser,"As we said, transformation is our highest priority.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Jane Fraser,We need to successfully address the concerns raised and that's 100% in our shareholders' interest.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Jane Fraser,"One of the pieces that's important in that is that we need to have collective accountability to succeed in addressing these concerns, it's a shift in our culture, and this award is one that is therefore dependent upon shared success versus individual incentives here.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Jane Fraser,"So it's an important part of delivering, and of course if we fail to deliver the outcomes of the transformation and are not successful in the execution, there will be no award.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Mike Mayo,"And when will we find – I guess we'll find out about those targets at Investor Day, so answering that question.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Mike Mayo,"As it relates to PSUs, how much was given in cash before and how many people will this apply to versus where it was before?",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Jane Fraser,"The PSUs are given to the executive management team and now we're extending that to the broader operating team which includes the leaders of our major businesses, and you'll see that information delivered in the proxy when we issue that in March.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Jane Fraser,So you'll get all of that information at roughly the same time.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,

2021,Q4,Ken Usdin,"Definitely starting to see a little bit of that balance, but I wonder if you could touch on, number one, like just how you're expecting that balance trajectory to go.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Ken Usdin,"Number two, spend versus lend and how much you're seeing in that, and then, three, just the losses are obviously just amazingly low and how would you anticipate card normalization.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Mark Mason,"Yeah, sure.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,

2021,Q4,Mark Mason,"People are using our cards, which is a good thing.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Mark Mason,"In terms of the liquidity that's still out there in the market, even though savings rates have started to normalize there's still a significant amount of liquidity that's out there in the market, and that's showing up in payment rates in both Branded Cards and Retail Services and frankly in some of the international card businesses as well.",liquidity,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Mark Mason,"And that has not subsided, and so we did start to see growth in Branded Cards loans, average loans are up 3% Branded Cards, the end-of-period loans were up 5%.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Mark Mason,"What matters a lot when you come out of a crisis like this is how you reinvest, and so we've spent a lot of time focused on targeting new customers and driving new account acquisitions.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Mark Mason,"Our new account acquisitions are up 43% in Branded Cards, and we've been also driving that just generally across the board in Retail Services as well.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Mark Mason,So getting a very good response in terms of new accounts coming onboard.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Mark Mason,"We've also been focused on how we drive installment lending activity, just kind of to broaden the lending that we're doing with this customer base, and we've seen significant growth in our Flex Loan, Flex Pay products as we've targeted customers who have historically been transactors to really move them on to that product.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Mark Mason,So very good growth there.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Mark Mason,"In fact in 2021, we've not only gotten the growth just in aggregate but if I look at kind of installment lending, we've gotten 90% of the total installment sales are in digital sales, which is another kind of low-cost acquisition approach that we've taken.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Mark Mason,"So good underlying indicators there, but again, it's not until payment rates start to subside.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Mark Mason,"We would expect, hope, that that would start to show up towards the back half of 2022.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Mark Mason,"In terms of the losses which was the other part of your question, very low loss levels.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Mark Mason,You heard me mention the delinquency rates earlier.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Mark Mason,"When I look at the loss rates earlier, when I look at delinquency trend there's really nothing to focus on there.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Mark Mason,"They remain quite low, and we don't see any signs or any areas of concern, I would say, but I would imagine those two would start to normalize as payment rates start to come down.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Ken Usdin,Great.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Ken Usdin,"Mark, thanks.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Ken Usdin,"And then just a follow-up, you mentioned the strongest quarter in advisory in a while.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Ken Usdin,I was just wondering if you could just comment broadly on Investment Banking pipelines across the product groups.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Mark Mason,"Yeah, the Investment Banking pipeline looks very strong.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Mark Mason,"We ended the year with significant growth in advisory up 146% year-over-year, well above the wallet.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Mark Mason,We've grown share there.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Mark Mason,"ECM was up about 16%, again above the wallet and really, that reflecting some of the fees coming from SPAC activity, so very good growth.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,

2021,Q4,Mark Mason,We think the pipeline still looks very strong.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Mark Mason,"We think the investments that we've made in bringing on bankers in some of the sectors we needed to beef up, sectors such as healthcare, technology, sponsors group, those investments are certainly starting to pay off, so we feel good about it.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Operator,Your next question is from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Glenn Schorr,Yeah.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Glenn Schorr,All righty.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Glenn Schorr,All righty.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Glenn Schorr,"So, I think we have a good long-term process in motion and measured in more than one year, but what do you think of the sort of – it feels like returns have to go down before they go up.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Glenn Schorr,"I know you have the overall goal to close the gap to peers, but between the capital that gets freed up, the GSIB buffer in the denominator, the capital markets partially normalizing some stranded expenses on sold franchises and then continuing to execute on the transformations, is it okay and is it normal, I think it's partially in our models that we go down first and then rise up?",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,Yes,gsib,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Mark Mason,"Yeah, so thank you, Glenn.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Mark Mason,"So look, if you look at 2021 with a 13.4% RoTCE and reserve releases that get close to $9 billion, I'd have to say yes, right?",billion,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Mark Mason,Because those reserve releases drive a considerable amount of that.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Mark Mason,"Now, it's important to compare that to 2020 where we had the opposite effect because we were building meaningful reserves, but as we look at the forward look, which we'll take you through in more detail, as Jane mentioned, we're focused on core parts of the franchise that show the opportunity for growth and the promise for higher returns, and that's where our energies are going to be focused and we think that's what's going to help to drive improved returns over time.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Glenn Schorr,Fair enough.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Glenn Schorr,The reserve releases have a big impact.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Glenn Schorr,"And then in terms of that growth, I think a couple of questions dance around this, so you could be short, but given your answer to what Citi is and wants to be in terms of premier franchise in all those industries, or business lines, I should say, how do you balance that you're doing what's right for stockholders in the near-term, drive stock return versus making sure you invest for the future, because each one of those is super competitive, each one of them has competitors as early as today, or as recent as today spending a ton of money to compete in those spaces, how do you balance that, invest for the long-term would be great versus improve the stock short term?",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Mark Mason,Yeah.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Mark Mason,"So let me start, and then Jane feel free to add in if you'd like.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Mark Mason,So the first thing I think it's important to remember is the focus that we're trying to put on these core franchises that drive returns over time.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Mark Mason,So we're prioritizing how we're going to allocate our resources and our investments in part through the divestiture activity.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Mark Mason,"The second thing I'd say is that we are investing in the franchise for the long-term, right, as opposed to trying to hit some short-term metric, and so that does involve us putting that money to work where there is client demand and where it leverages the competitive advantages that we have developed.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Mark Mason,And so that is the way we approach this with again an eye towards ensuring that we're clear and transparent with our investors and that if there's excess that we're returning that to our shareholders so they're not just sitting on the sidelines and not generating returns that they would expect of us.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Jane Fraser,Right.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Jane Fraser,"I'd also just jump in when you look at the different businesses that we are investing in, as Mark said, they're high-returning ones.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Jane Fraser,"So our Services businesses are much capital lighter, high return.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Jane Fraser,"Wealth Management, the same, and I think the opportunities that we've been seeing to continually increase share in Investment Banking, another high-returning business.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Jane Fraser,So that will certainly be helping us over time on that mix that you're talking about.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Jane Fraser,And not everything needs an enormous investment.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Jane Fraser,"If I look at wealth, for example, you put the different pieces together that we've already got and we're putting them into a single integrated business and proposition, it's not things that we're starting from scratch, so a lot of this is incremental.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Operator,"Ladies and gentlemen, please limit your questions to one question and one follow-up.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Operator,Your next question is from the line of Vivek Juneja with JPMorgan.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Vivek Juneja,A quick one firstly.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Vivek Juneja,"Now that you're exiting Mexico, Singapore and Hong Kong were not part of the exits when you announced the exit from the 13 markets in the consumer business.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Vivek Juneja,"Are you going to stay on with the consumer business in those markets, or meaning a traditional consumer business as you've had for years, or is that going to change?",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Jane Fraser,"No, we find that the franchises we have in Singapore and Hong Kong just given the nature of them are really naturally tied to the wealth franchise that we are building and investing in there of our existing very strong platform, as you say.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Jane Fraser,So we expect to continue to provide the range of different services and capabilities that we have because they are so complementary and help support our wealth business in two of the most major wealth hubs in the world.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Vivek Juneja,Great.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Vivek Juneja,"And a follow-up question, if I may have.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Vivek Juneja,"The NII change, Mark, that you made, what deposit beta are you assuming there?",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Vivek Juneja,And how much of the change is coming from US net interest income versus the rest of the currencies?,net interest income,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Mark Mason,"Yeah, so we haven't shared our deposit betas, but as you would imagine, the betas tend to be higher on the institutional side than on the retail side.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Mark Mason,And so that's that piece.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Mark Mason,"And I'm sorry, the second part of your question was what?",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Mark Mason,Vivek?,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Vivek Juneja,"The second part was how much of the change in net interest income from the interest rate sensitivity change, Mark that you're making...how much is the US net interest income versus the rest of the currencies?",net interest income,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Mark Mason,"The increase is roughly skewed towards the international, so I'd say of a $3 billion increase, I'd say about two-thirds/one-third international.",billion,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Vivek Juneja,That's where you were assuming more of the balance sheet run-off?,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Operator,Your next question is from the line of Charles Peabody with Portales.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Charles Peabody,Yeah.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Charles Peabody,"A question regarding the regulatory and political risk to share buybacks, and I ask that because earlier this week in the Powell renomination hearings, when you listen to the last two minutes of that testimony, Sherrod Brown went on a rail against buybacks in the banking industry.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Charles Peabody,And then last year I think President Biden had two speeches in which he spoke out against buybacks.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Charles Peabody,"So I'm trying to understand, is there – I mean, a transaction tax isn't going to stop you guys from doing buybacks, but are there other things being discussed out there other than just moral suasion to discourage buybacks?",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Jane Fraser,Yeah.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Jane Fraser,"We're going to do the right thing for our shareholders, and right now, particularly given where the stock's trading, buybacks are a very, very important and probably top of the stack for us action that we take, so no, we're very clear in terms of the importance of giving our shareholders back our excess capital.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Charles Peabody,"No, I understand that you want to.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Charles Peabody,I'm just trying to understand what the risk to your desires are from the regulatory or political side.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Jane Fraser,I don't believe there is one.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,

2021,Q4,Jane Fraser,"The confidence in the capitalization of the banks both coming into and coming out of the pandemic, and we're not overly concerned on that front.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Mark Mason,"We'll obviously adhere to regulatory guidelines as they exist or however they evolve, but that's exactly right.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Charles Peabody,All right.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Charles Peabody,"And then as a follow-up just on that subject, assuming these regulators – just getting into their seats, they're probably not going to be able to do anything this year on buybacks, but I'm assuming that they'll try and do something on buybacks next year.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Charles Peabody,So you want to do as much buyback short-term as you can and you've talked about getting back to like a $3 billion pace here in the first quarter.,billion,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Charles Peabody,How sustainable is that $3 billion pace?,billion,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Mark Mason,Yeah.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Mark Mason,"So look, I mean, first of all with the SCB framework, we take decisions on the capital actions on a quarterby- quarter basis.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Mark Mason,"Obviously, there's another CCAR run that we'll all go through that will determine at least part of the capital stack, and then obviously, there's the GSIB that's coming into play.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,Yes,ccar,Yes,gsib,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Mark Mason,So we factor all of those things in.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Mark Mason,"In our case, as we develop the capital plan, we also will take a look at the divestitures and in some instances the divestitures will generate TCE for us to return to shareholders.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Mark Mason,"There may be other impacts from divestitures that are temporary in nature that need to be factored in, but it's part of an entire annual capital planning process that we go through that factors all of those things in.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Operator,Your next question is from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Gerard Cassidy,"Can you guys share with us, when you think about the strategy refresh that is underway, are we 75% complete, 80% complete?",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Gerard Cassidy,"Mark, you alluded to maybe some of the Markets businesses that may not have the returns you want, there could be some area, but were you there, and by the Investor Day, can we assume that it will be completed?",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Jane Fraser,"In terms of the timeline to this one, this particular exercise is drawing to a close in terms of what I call the big step back as a new CEO.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Jane Fraser,So we said this is the last major structural decision that we're taking in Mexico.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Jane Fraser,"We're now focused on pulling together everything from Investor Day and that's where the new reporting structure, I think, that we've announced today is also a very important foundation for that.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Jane Fraser,"So I'm confident that we've made the right big structural decisions and that we're looking forward to Investor Day laying out the vision, the strategies, and the plan for going forward.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Mark Mason,Yeah.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Mark Mason,"And let me be clear, Gerard, just in case I wasn't.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Mark Mason,I'm not suggesting we're exiting parts of our Markets business.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Mark Mason,That is not what I'm suggesting at all.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Mark Mason,"What I am suggesting is that as we would always do, we're constantly looking for opportunities to optimize the way we use our balance sheet, capital, RWA, et cetera, and where we identify the need to rid ourselves of low-returning assets that we have, we do that, all right.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Mark Mason,"And so with rule changes like SA-CCR and the like, either pricing will adjust or we'll have to take a hard look at some of those assets to see if it still makes sense, and that's more of what I meant than ever suggesting we were exiting part of the Markets business.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Gerard Cassidy,"And just as a quick follow-up, obviously some of the businesses you're committed to, TTS, the investment banking area, you guys clearly are players there, you have economies of scale.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Gerard Cassidy,"When you look at the other businesses that you're committed to stay in, where is the heavy lifting going to come from where you really got to step it up to get those economies of scale, similar to the ones that are quite obvious.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Jane Fraser,"Yeah, you're right.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Jane Fraser,We have a number of businesses that are already extremely scaled in both markets.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Jane Fraser,"If we look at TTS, we are moving $4 trillion of volume daily there, so those are ones where the investments are much more around digitization, around data.",trillion,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Jane Fraser,"And in terms of where are we looking at getting more to – of increasing our scale, commercial bank is obviously one where we have a commercial banking presence in 30 different markets around the world and they're very focused on the same target market I talked about in the vision, which are those mid-market companies with global needs or multi-market needs.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,

2021,Q4,Mark Mason,"And to your point, Jane, commercial bank this year, huge opportunity to leverage more of the TTS offering that we have.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Mark Mason,"We're already seeing diversification in the commercial bank in terms of CMO and other markets products, and the revenue this year was up 12% year-over-year.",revenue,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Mark Mason,"And similar strength in acquisition of new clients in wealth, but those are two key areas, I agree.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,

2021,Q4,Mark Mason,"I'm not giving expectations for the quarter-by-quarter capital buyback decisions, in part because as I mentioned, with the new SCB rule, we're able to look at it on a quarterly basis, so I'm not giving guidance beyond that.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Mark Mason,"We'll talk more about the capital plan on March 2 broadly, right?",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Ebrahim Poonawala,"And just I guess going back, Jane, on US retail, I think the question is, is there something more meaningful that we should expect at the Investor Day?",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Ebrahim Poonawala,"And it's fine if you want to hold it till then, because if I recall correctly, you were a partner with Google, that didn't play out.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Ebrahim Poonawala,"The big question that investors have is, is there a better definition to the US retail franchise.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Ebrahim Poonawala,"And I'm just wondering will we get that at March Investor Day, or there's nothing radical that you have in store at least in the near-term as far as US retail is concerned.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Jane Fraser,You'll be certainly hearing directly from Anand who is responsible for that business on Investor Day and he'll lay out all of our US Personal Banking strategy of what we're looking at both from our top two cards franchise and our plan – what we're doing in Personal Lending as well as what we're doing in wealth and then obviously the retail bank and the supporting role it is playing for those two core drivers of growth for us in the States.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,

2021,Q4,Jim Mitchell,"Mark, maybe on just the expenses, I appreciate all of the moving parts with the divestitures and you're not going to give us the full year expense guidance number, but can you help on the jumping-off point at the first quarter?",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Jim Mitchell,We had compensation was up about $1 billion quarter over-quarter.,billion,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Jim Mitchell,"How much of that was just sort of the comp changes, or is that a good run rate to think about, so if you could just help us just the jumping-off point for first quarter would be helpful.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Mark Mason,"Yeah, you know what, I'm not going to be able to give you kind of more guidance on that.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Mark Mason,"I mean, what I would say is, again, you got a couple things that played through 2021 that will be important factors in 2022.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Mark Mason,"One, the hiring that we've done we're going to get a full year impact of that, at least for part of that in 2022, so that's going to play out.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Mark Mason,"Some of the – if you think about the mix for the transformation spend, which is a mix of both hires, third-party spend, as well as technology, that mix will start to shift over time away from third-party for sure and towards the others, and so we're going to have some of that dynamic start to play out in 2022.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Mark Mason,"In terms of the comp specifically in the fourth quarter, we obviously tie the comp performance for the full year is tied to revenues, and so as we would expect to see some forward growth based on the drivers, I mentioned earlier, we would expect to see comp related to that play out over the course of 2022.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Mark Mason,But I'd rather not get into the specifics here given that we're going to give you a better sense for it in early March.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Jim Mitchell,"Just maybe as a follow-up on that, just so I understand the sequential drivers, so you're saying it's mostly incentive comp or was that more new hires, or both?",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Jim Mitchell,Just from 3Q to 4Q change.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Mark Mason,"Yeah, in 3Q to 4Q, you've got both hires as well as incentive comp.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Operator,Your next question is from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Operator,MATT O’,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Connor,"I just wanted to follow up, you had said the sale of Mexico wouldn't be an easy transaction and was just hoping you could elaborate on that.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Connor,"And then just related, you talked about the capital that's allocated to the business being freed up, but any kind of initial thoughts on whether the transaction, the exit of the business will generate a gain or loss as we think about the combined or total capital impact.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Jane Fraser,"Why don't I kick that off, and Mark jump in.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Jane Fraser,"As I said, it won't be a simple transaction because we separate the bank into the Institutional business from the businesses that we're exiting, and that's something that we kicked off yesterday, that process.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Jane Fraser,"And then we'll be looking to go to the market in the spring and to be active with buyers, potential buyers in a few months' time.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Jane Fraser,So it's more just the complexity of separating the bank.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Jane Fraser,We've got good plans behind this.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Jane Fraser,"And as I said in my remarks, these are terrific, these are scaled, these are great franchises, and there's obviously a lot of speculation in the press which is too early to comment on, but we do think this is a jewel for someone.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Jane Fraser,It's just not for us.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Mark Mason,Yeah.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Mark Mason,"I agree, and I think it's premature to speculate on structure of the deal and things of that sort.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Mark Mason,"You're right, we do have about $4 billion of TCE allocated to the business.",billion,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Mark Mason,"The other layer of complexity is around the CTA, and you've heard us spend some time on that when we talked about the Australia sale and I introduced it as a complexity because there's an accounting treatment associated with the CTA that happens at signing that is separate from the capital implication that happens at closing.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Mark Mason,"So with a CTA, the capital impact flows through AOCI, but it's neutral once the deal is closed, and in Mexico, the consumer business would have a DTA of a little bit less than $3 billion or so, and so that's another factor that's involved with the transaction.",billion,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Jane Fraser,"A CTA, not a DTA.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Mark Mason,Did I say DTA?,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Jane Fraser,Yeah.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Mark Mason,"I’m sorry, CTA.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,

2021,Q4,Steven Chubak,You might need to grab a pen and paper.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Steven Chubak,But I wanted to just unpack some of the comments you made on the NII sensitivity and reporting differences versus peers.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Steven Chubak,"You noted there more than three times increase in NII assuming a static balance sheet, but there's still a lot of investors that just question your rate sensitivity profile given the fairly modest NII growth that we saw in the last cycle.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Steven Chubak,"And first question, just wanted to start by asking given your heavier institutional deposit gearing, wouldn't it be reasonable for us to expect that your deposit run-off would actually be greater than peers?",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Steven Chubak,"Two, does the NII guidance contemplate liability sensitivity in the Markets business, and could you help us size that potential drag?",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Steven Chubak,"And then just lastly, it's more of a catch-all.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Steven Chubak,Any idiosyncratic factors that you could speak to that would support a better NII outcome or higher rate benefit versus what we saw in the last cycle?,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Mark Mason,"Yeah, sure.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Mark Mason,"So look, we provided the sensitivity because we think comparability is important here, and you can see the magnitude of that difference is pretty sizable.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Mark Mason,"There's still going to be a difference between us and peers, but that difference narrows when you put it on a comparable basis.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Mark Mason,"We do have a skew towards institutional clients and they do carry a higher beta associated with them, but we also have a skew towards international currencies and we make good spreads there as well.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Mark Mason,"In terms of the impact through markets, the impact – I think the markets impact can come in any number of ways.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Mark Mason,I think rate moves and other uncertainty and volatility in the market can drive broader markets revenues which we would potentially see depending on how investors have to reposition their books.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Mark Mason,"In terms of the last part of your question, I don't think there's anything else that I would point to.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Mark Mason,"I mean, obviously with the excess liquidity that we've seen and been carrying in the market, we've been putting that to work in investments.",liquidity,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Mark Mason,We've increased our investment portfolio by some $70 billion.,billion,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Mark Mason,We expanded the duration to about 2.85 years and we still have significant dry powder to put to work with either client demand or in an increasing rate environment which we expect.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Steven Chubak,"That's great color, Mark.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,

2021,Q4,Jane Fraser,"Probably it's been breaking down some of the silos, and that the point on the principles we laid out, Mike, of connected is really a key piece of it.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Jane Fraser,We've rolled out some new leadership principles last year and it's very much around how do we get the firm very well-connected and really realize the full synergies.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Jane Fraser,"So breaking some of those old habits, I would say.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2021,Q4,Jane Fraser,The new structure is certainly helping us at the different initiatives we're taking.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,

2022,Q4,Mark Mason,So let me walk you through where we stand today.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Mark Mason,"From a revenue perspective, rates have moved much higher and at a faster pace across the globe which accelerated NII growth – and that coupled with the execution of our strategy has allowed certain businesses to accelerate.",revenue,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,

2022,Q4,Glenn Schorr,"Definitely appreciate all these outlook slides, they're very helpful.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Glenn Schorr,"So, my question on the outlooks is if you take a look at the current medium-sized return on tangible and getting to your target.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Glenn Schorr,I heard many comments about the path to getting there is on track.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Glenn Schorr,"Is it the expense bend at the end of '24, that is the material step-up from here to there, if you will, and/or is credit like a really big determinant in the process?",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Glenn Schorr,I'm trying to bridge the gap just in numbers from today's return on tangible targets.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Mark Mason,"Yes, sure, good morning, Glenn, thanks for the question.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Mark Mason,"So, we did give you some guidance here, we gave it to you both on the top line and the middle line for '23.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Mark Mason,"And then importantly, when we talk about the medium term, it's both the continued revenue growth, the 4% to 5% CAGR that I referenced, but it's also bringing the expenses down from this '23 forecast.",revenue,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Mark Mason,"And I mentioned in the prepared remarks, the drivers of what's going to bring these expenses down, the combination of the exit of the businesses and the expenses going away associated with that, with the benefits that we start to generate from the transformation spend and then org simplification that this type of strategic restructuring, if you will, in exiting all these countries, will create an opportunity for.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Mark Mason,"And so, it's a combination of revenue growth, expense bending of that curve and coming down.",revenue,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Mark Mason,"The cost of credit is kind of as we've been talking about for some time now, which is it normalizes over the next couple of years at levels that are consistent with what we've seen kind of prior to this COVID cycle that we've been managing through.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Glenn Schorr,I appreciate that.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,

2022,Q4,Mark Mason,"And so, we're committed to getting that done.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,

2022,Q4,Mark Mason,Together.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Operator,Our next question will come from John McDonald with Autonomous Research.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,John Mcdonald,"Mark, I wanted to dig into the revenue outlook for 2023.",revenue,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,John Mcdonald,"You've got about the midpoint, it kind of implies about 4% revenue growth this year, kind of consistent with what you talked about for that 4% to 5%.",revenue,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,John Mcdonald,"So, for this year, the 2023 guide, it looks like the NII is guided to be up about 3.5% and the Markets you're assuming kind of flat.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,John Mcdonald,"So, what's enabling you to get to the 4%?",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,John Mcdonald,Where are the drivers that are above 4%?,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,John Mcdonald,Is it some of those fee businesses?,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,John Mcdonald,And just a little more color there would be helpful.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Mark Mason,So let me make a comment first on the NII.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Mark Mason,"Just keep in mind with that number that I've given on the page is both the growth that occurs in some of our important Services businesses, and that really comes from both the annualization of rate increases that we saw in the back half of the year but also expected continued increases, particularly outside of the U.S. And given the make-up of our franchise, that will contribute to the NII growth.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Mark Mason,And then keep in mind that we're growing over the Legacy Franchise reductions in NII that we would see in 2023.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Mark Mason,"So, underneath that is some real momentum in the NII, notwithstanding a slower pace, the fact that it would be a slower pace than what we saw in 2022.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Mark Mason,"From an NIR point of view, I did mention that we do expect to see some normalization in market valuation.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Mark Mason,"And that would play out both in Banking, normalizing certainly relative to what we saw this year with wallets down 50% to 60%, as well as some normalization in Wealth and those would hit the NIR line, as you point out.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,John Mcdonald,"Sorry, if this is clear already.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,John Mcdonald,But just in terms of the idea of the cost curve bending at the end of 2024.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,John Mcdonald,"Is that going to mean that for the early part of 2024, expenses kind of rise above 2023 and then they kind of peak out, plateau, towards the back half of '24, is that how we should envision it?",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Mark Mason,"I'm not going to kind of get into '24 guidance, we'll kind of get through '23, and I'm confident about our ability to get to that roughly 54 number that I put out for '23.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Mark Mason,"I'm equally confident that we will bend this curve, and we'll bring it down to the levels that it needs to be in order for us to get to the RoTCE target, but I'm not going to kind of get into, John, the specifics of '24 except to say that by the end of '24, we will see that curve bending.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Operator,"Our next question will come from Erika Najarian with UBS, your line is now open.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Erika Najarian,"My first question is – again, thank you for all the clarification on the slide.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Erika Najarian,"Great job, Jenn and Tom, and Mark, obviously.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Erika Najarian,"But as we think about what it means to bend the curve, I think your investors are appreciative that you are accelerating the investments relative to your transformation.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Erika Najarian,"As we think about when Citi can hit that medium-term RoTCE, how should we think about what bending the curve really means?",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Erika Najarian,"And I'm not looking for guidance necessarily, but as we think about going past that hump, what's the better way of measuring?",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Erika Najarian,Is it an efficiency ratio?,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Erika Najarian,I think you mentioned something like it is the 60% to 63% efficiency ratio against that 4% to 5% revenue CAGR that you think you'll be able to hit by 2025?,revenue,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Erika Najarian,Can we think of it that way?,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Mark Mason,"Yes, so at Investor Day, we did talk about it, and we remain consistent and committed to that.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Mark Mason,We talked about getting to an efficiency ratio that's less than 60% in the medium-term period.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Mark Mason,And so that certainly will be part of the metric that we deliver on as we bring our costs down.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Mark Mason,"I think the other thing I'd mention, you mentioned the how, and I think there are a couple of important aspects to that, the exits are obvious in terms of those costs going away, at least a portion of it is.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Mark Mason,"The portion that's tied to stranded costs, Jane has been very, very clear with our entire management team of the importance of rethinking the organization and ensuring that the potentially stranded costs go away, and that means rethinking the way we do business and the way we operate different parts of our operations.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Mark Mason,"I think the third piece is technology, right?",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Mark Mason,"And so right now, a lot of what we're doing is manual.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Mark Mason,"And as we continue to invest in technology -- and technology is up pretty significantly this year, 14% or so, we expect it to be up 5% next year.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Mark Mason,"That technology build-out, if you will, will allow for us to reduce a lot of that manual activity, and that will bring down the operational cost for running the firm.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Mark Mason,"And so those are a couple of examples, I hope, of the how.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Mark Mason,"But I think importantly, you will start to see it in an improved operating efficiency over that period of time and getting to the target that we talked about at Investor Day.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Jane Fraser,"And I would say you can get some confidence around the path on many of these by the urgency with which we're executing the divestitures, for example, on getting those transactions closed.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Jane Fraser,And we've also tried to provide you as much clarity as possible about the timing of when these will be closing and the speed of the wind downs that we're executing.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Jane Fraser,So that will help.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Jane Fraser,"As Mark said, it's 3 big structural drivers of what will bend that curve.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,

2022,Q4,Erika Najarian,I have like 15 slides open on the computer.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Erika Najarian,"The second question, and maybe this is to you Jane, I think that your investors have appreciated your sense of urgency with regards to divestitures.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Erika Najarian,"I think the elephant in the room continues to be, I think, investors sort of expected an announcement on Banamex right now.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Erika Najarian,And I'm wondering if you're still considering just selling Banamex.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Erika Najarian,"Or are you thinking about different options on the table, such as an IPO?",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Jane Fraser,"So, we're in active dialogue at the moment, so I'm obviously not going to comment in great detail here.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Jane Fraser,"We do continue to pursue a dual path as you'd expect, because both are very viable options here.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Jane Fraser,And when we are in a position to give you clarity we will do so.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Jane Fraser,I think we've been fairly clear about the timing.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Jane Fraser,"We are also separating out the 2 franchises, our institutional franchise from the consumer franchise that we're selling because we see the institutional franchise as a very important part of the global network.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Jane Fraser,"As you can imagine, in today's environment, Mexico is key for many of our corporate clients around the world for their supply chains and we play a very important role there.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Jane Fraser,That is a lot of work in that separation.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Jane Fraser,I'm extremely pleased with the progress that we're making in that underlying work.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Jane Fraser,"But we are pursuing the dual tracks and when we have something to announce, we will be delighted to do so.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Operator,Our next question will come from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Operator,Your line is now open.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Mike Mayo,"I'm still trying to get over at this revenue and expense guidance, so you're implying you'll have at a minimum, flat operating leverage or positive operating leverage for 2023?",revenue,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Mike Mayo,Am I reading that correctly?,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,

2022,Q4,Mike Mayo,Am I reading that correctly?,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,

2022,Q4,Mark Mason,"But we are, as you see on the slide, targeting a range that does reflect growth in the top line.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Mark Mason,"That growth will likely be a little bit less than the growth that roughly 54 number would suggest, but we are on the right track, and we are getting there in a way that's consistent with the strategy that we talked about.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Mark Mason,"And we do feel confident in our ability to deliver on the guidance that we've put out here, similar to delivering on the guidance we gave last year, recognizing there are a lot of things going on in the broader environment.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,

2022,Q4,Mike Mayo,"So, doesn't that allow you to repurchase stock now?",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,

2022,Q4,Jane Fraser,"So, we don't see Banamex having strategic fit in the consumer franchises in that perspective.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Jane Fraser,"And when we run all the math, it is in the shareholders' interest that we sell that franchise and deploy that capital to our shareholders or into some of the investments at higher returns.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Jane Fraser,What you're suggesting is a very short-term move.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,

2022,Q4,Ebrahim Poonawala,"Just give us a sense, I'm just wondering hopefully, we don't get another disappointment as we get our hopes high for buybacks in the back half and there's something idiosyncratic about the business mix that could come back to hurt the bank?",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Ebrahim Poonawala,Would love any perspective there.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,

2022,Q4,Mark Mason,I think the Basel end-game and final views and decisions on that are still outstanding.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Mark Mason,And I think we'll have to take those into consideration when they become available.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Mark Mason,That is an industry dynamic that will play out however it plays out.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,

2022,Q4,Mark Mason,But it really is difficult at this point to opine on exactly what that means for the industry in light of the fact that there aren't final rules out just yet.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Ebrahim Poonawala,Got it.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,

2022,Q4,Ebrahim Poonawala,Am I missing anything there?,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,

2022,Q4,Mark Mason,"And so just factor in, I think what’s important is you’ve got a view on 2023, and I think we’ve given you additional clarity on how we intend to get to that medium-term, and I think that’s important.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,

2022,Q4,Betsy Graseck,"I know Jane, earlier you talked about the fact that – which you have announced looking for a new head to move that business forward – could you just give us a sense as to where you think the opportunity sets are greatest within that franchise for growth, because there's a bunch of different pieces, some on the advice channel, some of the more fee channels, some of the more balance sheet piece.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Betsy Graseck,And you already indicated U.S. as an opportunity to expand into.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,

2022,Q4,Betsy Graseck,And that could help us understand how you're planning on shaping this business going forward?,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,

2022,Q4,Jane Fraser,There's an important recovery that's going to occur in Asia.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Jane Fraser,"And you can see from our results last year, and across the board with other competitors with an Asian bend, that was materially impacted by COVID in China and the lockdowns and a slower pulling out of COVID in that market compared, broadly in Asia, compared to the U.S.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Jane Fraser,"So, we see some exciting growth opportunities there from the pure fundamentals in Asia across the board.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Jane Fraser,"You're absolutely right, in the U.S., we start from a smaller scale there.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,

2022,Q4,Jane Fraser,The Wealth at Work franchise is one that's had particularly pleasing growth in it.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Jane Fraser,And we've also been seeing some good growth as we pulled a comprehensive offering together for our customers.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Jane Fraser,The biggest upside there is investment products.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Jane Fraser,"And I think we've got a strong balance sheet franchise as it were, particularly the deposits, some of the margin lending and the like, mortgages, but this is really about the investment offering in the States.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Jane Fraser,"Then finally, I'd say there's also tremendous opportunity in the synergies, and we've been showing you this in terms of linkages between our Commercial Bank, our Banking franchise, the referrals up from the U.S.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Jane Fraser,"Personal Banking, we've had about 60,000 referrals this year in the U.S. alone from that, Markets also provides important referrals and even TTS.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Jane Fraser,"So, there are client referrals, there are business synergies between the common platforms, so we really see an opportunity for this multi-dimensional growth drivers in Wealth over and above the recovery in the investment space that everybody in the market should be able to benefit from.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Jane Fraser,And we'll continue investing appropriately in building out that front line as well.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Jane Fraser,"So, this is a very important part of our strategy.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Jane Fraser,"We're excited about it, it's the key pillar of the shift in business mix as we go forward as well, looking at the medium term.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Jane Fraser,And we're looking forward to the next phase of growth and focus here.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Betsy Graseck,And would you say that the investment spend required to execute on those revenue opportunities is likely to accelerate from here?,revenue,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Betsy Graseck,Or you've already done that investment spend and the investment is more sideways as opposed to accelerating?,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Jane Fraser,"I think in this current environment, as we've said, Mark and I have both said since middle of last year, this is something that we're pacing, but we're continuing to invest behind it.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Jane Fraser,"And you can see that growth in our client advisers, and remember that net growth in client advisers includes the divestiture we made in Uruguay, for example, so it's pretty strong.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Jane Fraser,"We don't have a huge amount that we need to invest because we have many pieces of the platform in place, and it's more been a story of integrating them and then making sure that we're putting the right digital and other investments behind it, but it's not such a large one in order to achieve the upside in the business, and we'll pace that as appropriate with market conditions.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Jane Fraser,"Mark, anything to add?",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Mark Mason,"Betsy, and you know this is, in a normal part of the cycle, this is a high margin, high-returning business and we've seen that in the past.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Mark Mason,"And so, we want to be well positioned for, as the market turns, having brought on client advisers, having brought in new clients through client acquisitions, which were up 24% in 2022.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Mark Mason,"And so, I think we're well positioned for that.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Mark Mason,"But as Jane mentioned, given where we are, we want to be smart about how we deploy the dollars.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Mark Mason,"And so, we'll re-pace as necessary, but ensure that we're ready for when things turn.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Jane Fraser,"And I'd just add, it was a couple of years ago that we announced the strategy and started executing on it, so we have the benefit of the historic investments, we're seeing the drivers playing out well.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Jane Fraser,"And as I say, we should be well positioned when the market turns here.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Operator,Our next question will come from Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Operator,Your line is now open.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Operator,MATT O’,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Connor,I just want to follow up on the comments about expecting Markets to be relatively flat in '23.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Connor,"Obviously, a very good 4Q and I know at least I was concerned about some of the RWA management and FICC in recent quarters and I think that proved not to be an issue as you think about leadership and revenue.",revenue,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Connor,"But as you think about '23, like the wallets have been strong in recent years.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Connor,"And to your point, your FICC leadership was strong this year.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Connor,How confident are you in kind of that flat Markets?,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Connor,And maybe what's driving that view?,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Mark Mason,"It's a Market business, right?",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Mark Mason,"And so, you know very well kind of the volatility that can come with any Markets business.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Mark Mason,"With that said, we've got a very, very strong FICC franchise.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Mark Mason,We had a very good year this year.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Mark Mason,"I think we're well positioned with the client base, and we're well positioned to maintain our #1 position as we go into 2023(1).",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Mark Mason,"Now how that market and market wallet moves, I think, is going to predicate on a number of things, including how the macro continues to evolve and how central bank activity continues to evolve and how currencies move and the like.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Mark Mason,"But again, I feel like we're well positioned to hold our position, if not gain more share as that plays out.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Mark Mason,"So, I think flat relative to a year that we've had up as significantly as it is, is a reasonable call based on what we know now.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Jane Fraser,We've also seen some depression of areas of strength in this business as well.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Jane Fraser,"So, Equity Derivatives, for example, is a real strength, this was an Equity Derivatives year.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Jane Fraser,"So, there's some -- and the corporate world with the volatility that's out there from a macro geopolitical environment is another real strength of ours.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Jane Fraser,"And for better or for worse, we're expecting that strength to continue, certainly so far.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Operator,Our next question will come from Jim Mitchell with Seaport Global.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Operator,Your line is now open.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Jim Mitchell,"Mark, maybe just digging into NII a little bit.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Jim Mitchell,"If you look at 4Q annualized, you have a decent step down, but when you take a look at your deposit franchise, your mix of business versus your peers, where they're seeing probably lagging retail deposits in the U.S., pricing that's going to hurt second half NII, you already have high betas, mostly institutional.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Jim Mitchell,You mentioned the benefit from non-U.S. rates and you're growing deposits.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Jim Mitchell,So why a similar trend in NII versus peers when you have a pretty different dynamic going on?,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Jim Mitchell,Just trying to think that through because it doesn't look like the Legacy you drag is very big in your chart.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Mark Mason,Similar dynamics you say in '23 or you're talking about the fourth quarter?,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Mark Mason,I'm not sure I followed.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Jim Mitchell,"I'm just trying to talk about versus peers, some have guided similarly to down from 4Q annualized run rates, but you have a very different dynamic in terms of deposit growth, benefits from non U.S. rates and a much higher beta.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Mark Mason,"I mean I think I'd point to a couple of things on the NII side, just as it relates to us.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Mark Mason,"One, importantly, that I mentioned in, and you point out is when you think about our mix of deposits, we've got about 65% or so in ICG and the balance, 35%, in our PBWM business.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Mark Mason,"We certainly skew to U.S. dollar, but we've got a 30% or so that is a non-U.S. dollar.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Mark Mason,"And when I think about the potential or the forward curves and how rates will likely move next year, we will get the benefit of further rate increases on the non-U.S. side, right?",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Mark Mason,"And so, if I think about our international presence, the betas tend to not be as high as they are here in the U.S. with our Corporate Clients segment.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Mark Mason,"And so, I think there's some repricing opportunities that we'll continue to actively manage as we did here in the U.S. And so, I do think it’s that international footprint, the globality of our franchise that plays to our strength in 2023.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Mark Mason,"The other thing that is apparent to us as we forecast this out, is the continued growth from a volume point of view.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Mark Mason,"And that volume growth – you've seen the momentum already pick up on the Cards side with significant growth in interest-earning balances and we'd expect that to continue, particularly as we see NCLs normalize and as we see payment rates start to temper.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Mark Mason,"And so, I think those things will be 2 major contributors.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Mark Mason,Mix is obviously a factor.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Mark Mason,"As you point out, we will be growing over some of the drag or reduction from Legacy.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Mark Mason,But it's that active management of the client engagement that we have across both portfolios that I think will be important factors to us delivering the growth that I talked about.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Jim Mitchell,"But I guess maybe I didn't phrase my question right, but I felt like ex Markets, I think your forecast for 2023 would be less than the 4Q run rate ex-Markets.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Jim Mitchell,And you shared a bunch of reasons why you have sort of a differentiated franchise.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Jim Mitchell,"So, I'm just trying to get a sense of what's driving the decline from 4Q levels.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Mark Mason,I think the thing you've got to pick up is really the Legacy franchise and the NII.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Mark Mason,A large part of the Legacy franchise revenues are NII revenues when you look at the mix of the products and the clients that we cover there.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Mark Mason,"And so, I think that's the important element here that we haven't quantified to a dollar amount, but that is explaining why it seems like muted growth relative to what you would have seen in the fourth quarter.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Mark Mason,"Obviously, there's other factors, but that's important.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Operator,Our next question will come from Gerard Cassidy with RBC Capital Markets.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,

2022,Q4,Gerard Cassidy,"Mark, can you share with us on your comments regarding, and this is true for your peers as well, the normalization of credit losses going forward since the industry has experienced incredibly low levels of credit losses.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Gerard Cassidy,"So, when you look at Branded Cards or Retail Services, how do you see that progressing through '23?",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Gerard Cassidy,"One of your peers pointed out that they think that by the end of '23, they may be at that normalization rate that they look to for their numbers, but I'm just trying to see what the trajectory is for what you guys are thinking.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Jane Fraser,"Yes, let me jump in and then I'll hand it on to Mark.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Jane Fraser,"I think we are expecting, under the current trajectory, to see the loss rates to reach the pre-COVID levels more at the year-end, early '24 level.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Jane Fraser,"If you think of Branded Cards, if I was to quantify, it is 20% of the way there now, CRS, we're about 40% of the way there now.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Jane Fraser,"Obviously, we have the benefit in CRS of sharing of the loss sharing with our partners, that helps us.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Jane Fraser,"But I hope that gives you a sense around it, probably the most important driver that we've been worried about, it was very uncertain with what was happening with payment rates.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Jane Fraser,"And I think we've got much more clarity as they started that normalization path, so that's driving a fair amount more certainty around what the direction is happening there.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Jane Fraser,"Frankly, the big question is more what's happening with spending than it is with the normalization right now.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Jane Fraser,It's a bigger uncertainty.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Jane Fraser,"But Mark, any other observations?",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Mark Mason,"The only thing I'd add is that, Gerard, you could see just depending on how this plays out, you could see kind of NCL rates tick up above normal levels and then come back down to normal levels in the timeline that Jane described, again, just depending on how the macro factors continue to play out.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Mark Mason,"But again, as we sit here and talk about these NCL rates, it's important to point out as well that we're very well reserved across all of these portfolios, and so to some extent, if you put macro assumptions aside and volumes aside, the NCLs kind of get funded by the reserves that have been established.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Mark Mason,"But the trend line is exactly as Jane described, just recognizing that you could see a tick-up above normal levels and then it come back down.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Jane Fraser,"Also, this is such an unusual market in the sense that you've got such strong labor market, driven by, frankly, supply shortage almost as much as demand.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Jane Fraser,"And we've also got the consumers with still very high savings that they're dipping into, and we're seeing a bit more of the movements happening at the bottom end of all of this.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Jane Fraser,"But this is not going to be like a normal recession, that’s why you hear us and others talking about the manageability and the mildness that’s likely if we do have one.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Gerard Cassidy,And what kind of unemployment rates are you guys assuming going into that kind of trajectory?,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Gerard Cassidy,Is it we get to 5% unemployment by first quarter '24?,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Mark Mason,I think a couple of things.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Mark Mason,"So, one, our base case scenario, if you think about what we just talked about includes kind of a mild recession in it, just as we forecasted it.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Mark Mason,The downside would be something a bit more severe than that.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Mark Mason,I'd say we're reserved for approximately a 5% unemployment rate just kind of overall when you average across the different scenarios that we have.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Operator,Our next question will come from Ken Usdin with Jefferies.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Operator,Your line is now open.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Ken Usdin,Just 2 quick questions.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Ken Usdin,"First one, just on Cards, Card NIM has been kind of flattish and I know that obviously has to do with just how you internally allocate the funding towards it.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Ken Usdin,But can you just kind of talk us through what's happening either with rewards or either incremental teaser rates on some of the new relationships and should we see the Card NIM expand from here?,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Mark Mason,"I'm not going to get into, Ken, kind of guidance on NIM.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Mark Mason,What I will say is that we have seen good traction in the early part of the year as it relates to acquisitions on the Card side.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Mark Mason,"We've made very good traction, and Jane, you may want to comment on kind of the relationships that we have with some of the partners, and with American.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Mark Mason,And we've also launched a number of new products that I think is helping to fuel the growth that we've seen on the heels of those investments and some of the increase that we've seen in spend rates as well as some of the average interest-earning balance and loan growth that we've seen.,loan growth,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Mark Mason,But I really don't want to get into the NIM guidance at the Card level or the aggregate at this point.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Jane Fraser,I mean we have a fabulous Cards franchise.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Jane Fraser,"And when we look at strong track record in the digital, the other innovations that are driving growth, driving the profitability, driving the returns both in our proprietary products as well as with our partners.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Jane Fraser,"And we're really seeing all of those drivers performing very, very strongly at the moment.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Jane Fraser,"From Custom Cash, that was 28% of new account acquisitions.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Jane Fraser,"So, an important new product refresh that's driving things, 80% of customers engaging digitally.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Jane Fraser,"Innovations like American, is just a fantastic partner of ours, really taking that to the next level.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Jane Fraser,And you can see that with the growth in spend in the category.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Jane Fraser,"So, I think there's a lot of reasons to be pretty excited about the growth in the returns and the margins and the other trajectories here.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Jane Fraser,"And as I say, a prime portfolio, which is always a good thing.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Ken Usdin,"Great, thanks.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Ken Usdin,"And my second question was, there was an article about changing management up in the Wealth Management business this week.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Ken Usdin,"And I just wonder if you can talk about that, but also just about the progress that you're making inside the Wealth Management relative to your, the KPIs and the goals that you discussed at Analyst Day.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Jane Fraser,"Well, sure.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Jane Fraser,"I mean, 2 years ago, I asked Jim O'Donnell to put the Wealth business together from the various components that we had around the firm.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Jane Fraser,"And now, as we move to the next phase, but as we've said, a strategically important business, I thought it was the right time to change the leadership also because Jim is going to play an important role moving forward, supporting Paco with the ICG strategy that we laid out at Investor Day.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Jane Fraser,"He's got a lot of relationships with investors, family offices, private equity, sovereign wealth funds, and he's going to be helping drive those along with other investors to make sure we bring the firm's full capabilities to these clients.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Jane Fraser,"So, I felt the time was right to make the move.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Jane Fraser,"And we will be, as indicated, swiftly moving to go out and have a look for our next leader of that business.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Jane Fraser,"And in the meantime, it’s business as usual as we grow out and follow the strategy that we have, and we're looking forward to the market turning, as I'm sure everyone is, and feel that we're well positioned to do so.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Operator,Our next question will come from Steven Chubak with Wolfe.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Operator,Your line is now open.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Sharon Leung,This is actually Sharon Leung filling in for Steven.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Sharon Leung,"Just on the topic of credit, one of your peers noted this morning that they would expect to see an incremental $6 billion or so of reserves if they assume 6% unemployment under CECL.",billion,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Sharon Leung,"Just wondering if you could provide some similar sensitivity to reserve levels, and how should we think about the provision trajectory versus the 4Q base based on your macro outlook and potential growth mass headwinds?",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Mark Mason,I'm not going to kind of do sensitivity scenarios with you here on the fly.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Mark Mason,"What I will say is that as we build these reserves, we are building them against 3 scenarios, that base scenario that I mentioned, the downside scenario, and upside scenario, and we weight those scenarios.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Mark Mason,And the base that we used this quarter built in a mild recession.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Mark Mason,"And in that baseline, unemployment was, call it 4.4% or so in terms of the unemployment assumption.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Mark Mason,We also had a downside scenario.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Mark Mason,Unemployment in the downside scenario got to a 6.9% or so.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Mark Mason,And then we had an upside scenario.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Mark Mason,The weighted average across the quarters was about the 5.1% that I mentioned.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Mark Mason,And those were factors that went into the reserve that we established in the quarter.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Mark Mason,"And largely, when you think about the weightings we put on those scenarios, the weighting skewed towards that base and that downside.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Mark Mason,"The reserve we built this quarter was largely in the consumer business, PBWM and specifically around Cards.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Mark Mason,And that really had to do the change quarter-over-quarter with the change in HPI.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Mark Mason,"But what I would say is that it also reflects, as I mentioned earlier, a Cards portfolio that remains of a very good quality and with loss rates that are well below what they would be in a normal cycle.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Mark Mason,And it does pick up the fact that there's volume growth that we saw in the quarter there.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Mark Mason,"So, I'm not going to kind of run scenarios for you, but hopefully that gives you some perspective as to what's underneath the models that we've used to establish these reserves.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Mark Mason,"And obviously, we do that on a quarter-by-quarter basis.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Jane Fraser,"I'd also just jump in, one of the areas that sometimes gets misthought of about the firm, is on the corporate credit side.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Jane Fraser,"When we look at our corporate client portfolio, don't equate where we take credit risk with the global footprint.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Jane Fraser,"When I look internationally, 90% of our international exposure are with multinational firms and their subsidiaries, and these, all this is investment grade.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Jane Fraser,"I think that's another area whereas we look at the quality of the corporate loan portfolio, as you saw with Russia and others, we will be conservative in the reserving we take.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Jane Fraser,But I think important to understand the nature of where we take that corporate credit risk.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Sharon Leung,"That's really helpful, thanks.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Sharon Leung,"And then as a follow-up, it seems like a part of your revenue targets for 2023 depends on some improvement in the environment.",revenue,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Sharon Leung,"For example, stabilizing equity markets, IB rebound.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Sharon Leung,"And Jane, you also noted that the medium-term targets are designed to be achievable in different environments.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Sharon Leung,"So, if the revenue backdrop continues to be challenged like we saw in 2022, can you just talk about some of the levers you might be able to pull that might provide an offset?",revenue,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Mark Mason,"Well, it kind of depends on what the drivers are of a different environment, right?",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Mark Mason,"Because you could have, I don't anticipate this, but you could have continued pressure in Investment Banking, but you could also have continued volatility in rates or currencies and that could mean more upside than flat for the Markets business.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Mark Mason,"So, there are a lot of puts and takes that one can scenario out.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Mark Mason,I think what's really important is that we have a diversified portfolio of businesses that have strategic connectivity to them.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Mark Mason,"And so what that allows for is that as the environment shifts in some way that we may not have predicted that we were often able to still drive significant performance as we did this year and so, without calling exactly how it might vary from what’s here, that's what gives us the confidence around the guidance and really to remain steadfast on the strategy that we've talked about and really push execution, and that's exactly what we're doing.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Jane Fraser,"And an important part of '23, it's not just the impact of the cycle, but also, you'll see the impact of the different investments that we've been making.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Jane Fraser,"And you've certainly seen that, for example, in Services this year, and we've been very transparent around the 70 basis point increase we've seen in wallet share in the 12 months leading up to the third quarter.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Jane Fraser,"So, you've not only got drivers here in terms of what's happening in the market, but you've also got the strategic drivers, also kicking in more and more together as Mark referred to the synergies.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Mark Mason,"That’s a great point, Jane, because it may not always show up in the top line, which is why we put those KPIs out there.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Mark Mason,There are often indicators of some of the upside that's on the come as the market evolves.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Operator,Our last question will come from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Operator,Your line is now open.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Mike Mayo,"So, one question, one follow-up.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Mike Mayo,"So, your slide says you have a CET1 target of 13% by mid year, but you're already there.",cet1,no,Yes,cet1,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Mike Mayo,"And I guess, if we go back to the Banamex thing, is that kind of assuming potential capital impact from divestitures or why would you have a target 6 months out when you've already met it?",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Mark Mason,"Yes, Mike, I have to tell you I'm surprised that you're asking about Mexico, just given our history together, but I understand it.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Mark Mason,And what I would say is that a couple of things.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Mark Mason,"One, we clearly see where we trade, right?",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Mark Mason,And we're not happy about where we trade.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Mark Mason,And we think our strategy warrants us trading better than where we trade today.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Mark Mason,"So, if we could buy back, right, if we could do buybacks, as soon as we're able to do buybacks, we will, right?",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Mark Mason,I mean that is part of the way we deliver value for our shareholders.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Mark Mason,The second thing I'd say is we did get to the 13% sooner.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Mark Mason,"And that was, again, in accordance with executing against our strategy.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Mark Mason,"And our parts of our business, particularly the Markets business, has done a really good job at delivering against the metric we put out of revenue to RWA, and we've been able to get there without damaging the franchise, which is what you see in the continued strength and performance in that business, particularly in Fixed Income.",revenue,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Mark Mason,"What's ahead of us, as you rightfully pointed out, is that we've got a number of exits that have to take place, there's puts and takes across many of them.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Mark Mason,"But Mexico, in particular, will have a temporary, temporary impact on our CET1 ratio.",cet1,yes,Yes,cet1,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,Yes,cet1 ratio
2022,Q4,Mark Mason,"And so, we want to be mindful of that as we manage over the next 2 quarters so that we can absorb that.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Mark Mason,"And we also want to make sure that we're positioned to continue to serve our clients over the next couple of quarters and always, but certainly over the next couple of quarters, while we manage the temporary headwind from that exit.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Mark Mason,"So hopefully, that gives you a better sense for it, but we're actively managing this, and we have not lost focus on the importance of returning capital to shareholders.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Jane Fraser,I want to reiterate that as well.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Jane Fraser,I mean it's very important to us.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Jane Fraser,"And as Mark said, we know where we trade.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Jane Fraser,"We've made a number of moves to align ourselves to our shareholders' interest in compensation and management interest, all these various dimensions.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Jane Fraser,And we just want to make sure that we hit what we say we're going to do and continue delivering against what we say we're going to be delivering.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Jane Fraser,"And with the CTA impact essentially in Mexico, we want to make sure that we're taking that into account.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Mike Mayo,"All right, that's very clear.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Mike Mayo,"And then lastly, your NII guide, excluding Markets related, is higher for 2023, but I think that implies a little step down from the fourth quarter level, not as much as JPMorgan was guiding down 10% from the fourth quarter level.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Mike Mayo,I was thinking there might be some delayed benefits from being outside the U.S. What are some of the ins and outs there?,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Mark Mason,You've got a couple of points here.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Mark Mason,"So one is, we won't see NII momentum as we've seen in 2022, just as betas start to increase on the ICG side and get to terminal levels, that's obviously going to slow or put pressure on the pricing as we go into '23.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Mark Mason,"But some of the other important drivers of the growth will be the annualization of the rate hikes that happened late in the year, and so that will be a plus in 2023.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Mark Mason,"And you'll also see, as I mentioned earlier, some of the rate increases that we anticipate outside of the U.S. and given our mix, that will benefit us in 2023.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Mark Mason,"And then there'll be volume that will contribute to that NII growth, particularly as we continue to see good momentum, which we anticipate on the Card side.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Mark Mason,"The offset will be the Legacy franchise, right?",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Mark Mason,"And so, as those exits occur, as the wind downs continue, as I mentioned earlier, that revenue mix does skew towards NII and so we'll have to grow over that, and we will grow over that to kind of get to the target that we've set.",revenue,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Mark Mason,So those are the puts and takes.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Operator,There are no further questions at this time.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Operator,I will now turn the call over to Jenn Landis for closing remarks.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Jennifer Landis,Thank you everyone for joining us today.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2022,Q4,Jennifer Landis,"If you have any follow-up questions, please reach out to IR.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q4,Jane Fraser,"Thank you, Jenn, and a very happy New Year to everyone.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,

2023,Q4,Mark Mason,"But importantly, when we do invest to capture those growth opportunities, we're trying to be agile about it, which means if those opportunities don't play out in the way we're expecting because the cycle just doesn't mature or materialize in that fashion, we've got to be disciplined enough to dial them back, and that's what you've seen over the past year plus, is that we've been investing in the business.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q4,Mark Mason,"Where we didn't see the upside that we anticipated, we dialed back that spend, right, and that's the type of iterative process, if you will, Glenn, that we're putting in place to ensure that on the other side of this, we're still positioned to capture growth.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q4,Mark Mason,"Investment Banking, for example, we have invested in healthcare, in technology, building out to prepare ourselves for when that market rebounds.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,

2023,Q4,Mark Mason,"We're investing heavily in our TTS franchise to ensure we can remain competitive there, so it's that type of discipline that's required.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q4,Mark Mason,"It is sometimes a trade-off, but it's one that we've been very focused on being smart about.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,

2023,Q4,Glenn Schorr,Maybe a quickie on Services.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,

2023,Q4,Jane Fraser,Let's maybe start with TTS.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q4,Jane Fraser,"When we think about the performance of TTS, which, as we say, the growth this year up 19% ex-Argentina, came from a combination of both rates and the strong business actions we've taken.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q4,Jane Fraser,And you can see that in the different drivers.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,

2023,Q4,Jane Fraser,That was not just because of the rate cycle.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q4,Jane Fraser,It obviously helped.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q4,Jane Fraser,"And we certainly expect to grow revenues at mid-single digit now as we lap the prior periods that benefited from those rate increases, and that's going to come from a few different areas.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q4,Jane Fraser,"One, the focus on our fee strategy, where we're capitalizing on strong client engagement, market-leading client solutions, and we're delivering on a lot of the different growth initiatives that we've been investing in across all our client segments.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q4,Jane Fraser,We'll continue optimizing our deposit book and bringing in high-quality deposits.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q4,Jane Fraser,"And in a lower rate environment, GDP is typically higher, so you'd expect to see some higher growth in our capital-efficient payment volumes.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q4,Jane Fraser,You'll see us continuing to acquire new clients and deepen relationships with existing clients.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q4,Jane Fraser,"And I'd point to our confidence here, 27% increase in our new client acquisition this year and a sustained win/loss ratio of 82% on new deals, and that was across different client segments.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q4,Jane Fraser,"And revenues from these clients just continues to ramp up, as we expand across the different geographies and product suites with them.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,

2023,Q4,Jane Fraser,We expect to see strong client momentum.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q4,Jane Fraser,"We've been getting consistently good client feedback regarding our capabilities, so we expect to see good global growth that will certainly help as the rate cycle comes down.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q4,Jane Fraser,And it is a crown jewel for a reason.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q4,Jane Fraser,"And then, just quickly on Securities Services.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q4,Jane Fraser,"I think where we're seeing, we mentioned, we've got a number of marquee wins there across all the client segments.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q4,Jane Fraser,That pipeline is both investors and issuers.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q4,Jane Fraser,And one of the core strategies that Okan put in place was to grow share with the US-based asset managers.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q4,Jane Fraser,We were at 2.6% share in 2020; we're now at 4.3%.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,

2023,Q4,Jane Fraser,I think that's our ability to connect our capabilities that gives these players huge efficiencies for our clients.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q4,Jane Fraser,"Mark, anything I've missed there?",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q4,Jane Fraser,You know I love this business.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q4,Mark Mason,"As you should rightfully so, high-returning business, great growth prospects.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q4,Mark Mason,"To answer one of your questions, Glenn, about half of the NII growth, we could attribute to interest rates.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q4,Mark Mason,"And about half, I'd say, is business action, so us working with the clients to drive that momentum.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q4,Mark Mason,"And then, if you think about the noninterest revenue, for Services, they're up about 20% in the quarter year-over-year if you exclude the impact of the Argentina devaluation, and up 7% on a full year basis.",revenue,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q4,Mark Mason,"And so, good momentum in the noninterest revenue growth as well.",revenue,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,

2023,Q4,Mark Mason,"So, it's an ongoing active management that tries to balance servicing our client needs, with, obviously, holding a responsible amount of capital in light of the uncertainty that's out there, and with an eye towards buybacks where we can do that.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q4,John Mcdonald,"And just as an expense follow-up, I wasn't clear.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,

2023,Q4,Jane Fraser,"It's a multi-year journey, as we've always been clear around this, ultimately, with benefits to the shareholders.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q4,Jane Fraser,"And more of the expense saves that we've been talking about are, I'd separate out transformation from sort of the operating expense base of our businesses, which we want to make sure is as productive and as effective as possible.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q4,Jane Fraser,And the types of benefits we're seeing.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,

2023,Q4,Jane Fraser,So we start seeing some of the benefits of those come in.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q4,Jane Fraser,"Other things, we automated independent price verification for 90% of our prioritized fixed income and equity securities.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,

2023,Q4,Jane Fraser,That will also begin to start having some benefits for us.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q4,Jane Fraser,"So there is a cumulative effect that is beginning to build now from all the work we've done, but it will take some time to really kick into the, as Mark said, when you really feel it, is a few years out.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q4,Jane Fraser,"But we'll keep giving you the proof points of things as we're going, so it's not a just trust us that i s coming, you'll begin to see it build.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,

2023,Q4,Jim Mitchell,"Hey, good afternoon.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q4,Jim Mitchell,"Mark, maybe just to follow up on the expense, slide 22, where you talk about $2 billion to $2.5 billion of expense saves.",billion,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q4,Jim Mitchell,I guess I'm struggling with the numbers there.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q4,Jim Mitchell,"I think if you look at exit and wind- down markets, you're probably close to $2 billion in numbers there.",billion,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q4,Jim Mitchell,"And maybe the stranded costs, you can't get all of that out.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q4,Jim Mitchell,You're doing about severance is $700 million to $1 billion in 2024.,"billion, million",no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q4,Jim Mitchell,So doesn't seem like there's a ton of actual cost saves in that number.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q4,Jim Mitchell,"And just maybe I'm wrong, if you could just kind of walk me through the numbers embedded in there and if there's, you've kind of eluded to more to come beyond the intermediate term.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q4,Mark Mason,"Yeah, I think the thing I'd point out to you is a couple things.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q4,Mark Mason,"One, obviously, we're forecasting revenue growth over this period of time.",revenue,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q4,Mark Mason,"And so, there's going to be volume-related expenses associated with that.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q4,Mark Mason,"The second thing I'd point out, as I just mentioned to the prior question, is that we're continuing to invest in risk and controls and in the transformation over this period of time.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q4,Mark Mason,"And so, what you see is there's an increase in expenses associated with at least those two things.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q4,Mark Mason,"And that's offset by the savings that we're starting to generate, particularly from the org simplification that Jane has talked about, as well as from the stranded cost reduction that will continue to play out, as well as from some of the rightsizing of businesses that we've referenced in some of the prepared remarks.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q4,Mark Mason,"And so, important to think about, there are headwinds and tailwinds that kind of net down to this $2 billion to $2.5 billion.",billion,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q4,Mark Mason,"And then the final point that I'd make is if I look at this medium-term number of $51 billion to $53 billion that still has Mexico in it and one of the other pages we'd point to, expenses around Mexico.",billion,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q4,Mark Mason,"But because of where we are, we'll be in the IPO process, that's still going to be part of this expense base, and so you can't lose sight of that.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q4,Jim Mitchell,"Well, that's an important clarification that the $2 billion to $2.5 billion includes revenue related volume growth, so that's helpful.","billion, revenue",no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q4,Jim Mitchell,"And then, just maybe the other, on the slides talking about revenue targets.",revenue,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q4,Jim Mitchell,One of the big numbers not talked about was Markets.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q4,Jim Mitchell,"How are you thinking, volatility has come in, macro picture s getting better, maybe that mutes volatility, how do you think about that business in 2024 as it relates to your guidance?",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q4,Mark Mason,"As you know, it's a tough business to forecast, certainly, for a full year, and in some instances for a quarter, and so, we've basically kind of backed that out but we assume markets kind of flat to modestly down, but we've backed it out, and it's roughly flat.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q4,Mark Mason,"Not of the $80 billion to $81 billion, right, you see the guidance of NIR ex- Markets and NII ex-Markets, so in the $80 billion to $81 billion, we've assumed it roughly flat.",billion,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,

2023,Q4,Ebrahim Poonawala,"Just wanted to follow up on something I think Mark said at the end of his very first response around, it's very hard in my seat to figure out whether you're going to grow revenues or shrink revenues given the macro.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q4,Ebrahim Poonawala,"Should we take it based on what you've said today as we look into 2026 getting to that 11% RoTCE, if for whatever reason, revenue falls short and you feel good about the expense flex to mitigate that headwind?",revenue,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q4,Jane Fraser,"It's Jane, obviously.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q4,Jane Fraser,"I want to just jump in on one bit, which is we are committed and we're very confident around the 4% to 5% revenue growth rate, so there isn't any backing away from that number.",revenue,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q4,Jane Fraser,"And that's in various macro environments, et cetera.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,

2023,Q4,Mark Mason,"If you think about the strategy and the strength of those five core businesses, we've got a lot of conviction around that.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q4,Mark Mason,"With that said, as you point out, Jane, under a circumstance where that doesn't play out, there are obviously volume-related incentive comp expenses and the like that would naturally come down.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q4,Mark Mason,We'd ensure that they came down with the revenue decline or shortfall.,revenue,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q4,Mark Mason,"And then we'd recalibrate other spend, other investments, spend not related to risk and controls and transformation, but other investments across the platform, we'd recalibrate accordingly.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q4,Ebrahim Poonawala,Well said.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,

2023,Q4,Operator,Our next question will come from Gerard Cassidy with RBC.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q4,Operator,Your line is now open.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q4,Gerard Cassidy,"Mark, can you share with us, in your revenue guide, in the net interest income, I know you mentioned it's going to be lower and part of it is due to lower interest rates.","revenue, net interest income",no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,

2023,Q4,Mark Mason,"You've got a range there and the reason I described it like that is that, if you think about our IRE, as we've shown it in the Qs before, we're positioned such that, with 100 basis point move, parallel shift in rate across the curve, the US dollar impact would only be a couple hundred million dollars, all right, and so, to the negative, obviously, but it's a couple hundred million dollars.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q4,Mark Mason,"And so as we think about that forecast, and as I mentioned, NII being down a bit, that covers kind of three to six cuts over the course of 2024, likely back-loaded, but that's what's in there.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q4,Gerard Cassidy,"Very good, I appreciate that.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,

2023,Q4,Gerard Cassidy,"Especially on the downsizing, I think you guys mentioned, the head count of about 20,000 coming down.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q4,Gerard Cassidy,How do you keep the morale of the organization elevated when you have these types of tough decisions that you all have to make?,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,

2023,Q4,Jane Fraser,"We're trying to be as transparent with our people, as we are with our investors about what we need to do, why we're doing it, what to expect and laying that out so people understand the logic behind the decisions, and then they understand what the decisions are as quickly as they can.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q4,Jane Fraser,I think that's the most humane way to do this.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,

2023,Q4,Erika Najarian,"I know you still have a little bit of ways to go, but you do have 100 basis point buffer to your minimum.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q4,Erika Najarian,"And I know Basel III endgame is still out there, and I'm sure that reducing risk just doesn't mean expenses, but also reducing your or being mindful of your RWA footprint.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,Yes,basel iii,No,
2023,Q4,Erika Najarian,"And given where your stock is relative to book, when will you be more comfortable about giving sort of a longer-term outlook that was underpinning your RoTCE target with regards to the buyback?",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q4,Jane Fraser,"Erika, it's a great question.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,

2023,Q4,Jane Fraser,"The comment period just got extended, and we want to see what that is.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q4,Jane Fraser,I think you've all heard us at the Senate banking hearings with our concerns about it.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q4,Jane Fraser,"I very much hope that it is either completely revised or very materially, so it doesn't have a negative impact on the economy and the US banking system competitiveness, the move for more business to the shadow banks, which I think has got to a point, which is not healthy.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,

2023,Q4,Erika Najarian,"I think that it was very helpful that you said on this public forum where you're trying to build credibility, because as I think about what long-only investors have been dying to see from Citi in terms of the previous leadership was that sort of awareness.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q4,Erika Najarian,"And I think just having that awareness recognition will be very important to investors, so thank you.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,

2023,Q4,Operator,I think a lot of us don't understand that type of exposure.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,

2023,Q4,Jane Fraser,"Because I would have thought that's a question that is on everybody's minds, particularly given the firm's overall low level of returns and our headline numbers this quarter about what we've been doing with Russia and Argentina, the sort of bigger strategic question behind it, and then we'll get to your specifics on the Russia front.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q4,Jane Fraser,"If you think about Citi, we have a differentiated global business model, and that means we're committed to the countries in which our multinational clients operate over the long run.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q4,Jane Fraser,"So, that means we hold long-term capital in those countries, upon which we generate solid returns through the cycle.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q4,Jane Fraser,"And let me just point to our leading Services and FX businesses are the heart of that network, and they're generating double-digits, as you can see.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q4,Jane Fraser,With that footprint comes a set of risks.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q4,Jane Fraser,"So, I think of it in terms of credit, currency, transferability of capital.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q4,Jane Fraser,And we've proven our ability to manage those risks consistently over a long period of time.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q4,Jane Fraser,"And with respect to the Q4 currency and transfer items, while the timing was unknown and we've highlighted those risks in our disclosures for a couple of years, I'd say, Russia is rather unique.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,

2023,Q4,Mark Mason,"And essentially, what's left is that we have a custody business and we're holding corporate dividends that are our clients' proceeds we re unable to pay those out by law, by regulation, and so we have to hold those and so that's what's being referenced in the slide when we say unremittable Russia corporate dividends.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q4,Mark Mason,"And so, that is not a risk of loss for us, but we're unable to kind of clear those because of the state of play in Russia at this stage.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q4,Mark Mason,"And then, just separately in credit cards.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,

2023,Q4,Mark Mason,Just what gives you confidence that the card losses will peak this year is it just getting back to that a little bit of a normalized level?,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q4,Mark Mason,Is it some tightening that you've done?,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q4,Mark Mason,"What's driving that confidence, looking out this year?",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q4,Mark Mason,"Because you're probably seeing a step-up coming still, right?",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,

2023,Q4,Mark Mason,"For a 100 basis point move in a parallel shift, we're looking at probably a negative $1.6 billion or so, but important to point out that the US dollar component of that is only a couple hundred million dollars.",billion,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q4,Mark Mason,"Similarly, if rates moved in the other way, positive of 100 basis points, there'd be a small movement as it relates to US dollar exposure.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q4,Mark Mason,"So our US dollar exposure is relatively neutral, again, assuming a static balance sheet, a parallel shift in the curve.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,

2023,Q4,Jane Fraser,"And speaking of our own pipeline, the breadth, the depth, the quality of it's very sound.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,

2023,Q4,Operator,Your line is now open.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q4,Scott Siefers,Have you all assumed any revenue attrition just related to the reduction in force?,revenue,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q4,Scott Siefers,"And I guess just broadly, how might that be embedded in the 2024 revenue guidance?",revenue,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q4,Scott Siefers,"And I guess just at a top level, maybe just a shot or two on...",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q4,Jane Fraser,"Sorry, Scott, I didn't hear what it was.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,

2023,Q4,Scott Siefers,I'm sorry.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q4,Scott Siefers,"Yeah, just curious if you have assumed any revenue attrition related to the reduction in force over the coming year.",revenue,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q4,Jane Fraser,"I think a lot of the moves that we've made from the organization simplification, so the 5,000 or so roles we talked about, they're mainly managerial roles.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q4,Jane Fraser,"And they've mainly impacted the functions and the geographies, not nearly so much the revenue from revenue generators.",revenue,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q4,Jane Fraser,"And the other piece is with the client organization, we're actually putting much more time into the hands of our people to drive revenue forward, so I think what we're looking at here is getting rid of areas of bureaucracy and where we've been too complicated, where we can drive efficiency whilst preserving our frontline and encouraging them to be as revenue-productive and delivering the full force of the firm to the client.",revenue,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q4,Jane Fraser,So I like to see the opposite actually.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,

2023,Q4,Scott Siefers,"Do they hold kind of flattish with a core rate, or would there be any normal course of business growth?",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q4,Mark Mason,"I think what I'd say is that, you should expect it in the first quarter.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q4,Mark Mason,"We'd likely see an uptick in our total expenses relative to the fourth, in part because, as Jane has mentioned, we anticipate that there'll be more to the org simplification and, therefore, dollars associated with that in Q1.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q4,Mark Mason,"And then, from there, I would expect that you see a downward trend through the fourth quarter.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,

2023,Q4,Mark Mason,"Modest declines outside, but yes declines outside as well, but not nearly of the magnitude of what we're talking about in the US.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q4,Vivek Juneja,"And then, Jane, to your point about the 20,000 head count cuts and I heard you just mentioned 5,000 from managerial positions, where are the rest 15,000 coming there?",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,

2023,Q4,Jane Fraser,"There's about 13%, and these are mainly manager roles, as I talked about earlier.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q4,Jane Fraser,"Then, when we think about where are other expense opportunities on top of this, as Mark was talking about earlier, the stranded costs, we'll be completing the elimination of the stranded costs from the divestitures.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q4,Jane Fraser,"We'll be continuing, and you've seen us been continuing that, exiting marginal businesses and hobbies and the like and being very disciplined about that.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q4,Jane Fraser,We've got some businesses where we feel we need to right size the core expense base.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,

2023,Q4,Jane Fraser,He's off to a strong start.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,

2023,Q4,Jane Fraser,We'll still have areas that we're investing.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,

2023,Q4,Jane Fraser,"It's going to be expense growth still in the top, from volume growth that we've got.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q4,Jane Fraser,And we will be investing in our transformation.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,

2023,Q4,Steven Chubak,And how large of a contributor is that to revenues overall at Citigroup?,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q4,Mark Mason,"So, let's see, so obviously, the proposal is out there and we've factored in what's knowable as it relates to that.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q4,Mark Mason,"We haven't given guidance externally on what that impact is, but we do believe there are offsets and mitigants that, over time, we'll be able to kind of bring into play.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q4,Mark Mason,"And so, a long-winded way of saying our revenue forecast does assume some basic level of late fee adjustment.",revenue,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q4,Steven Chubak,Got it.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,

2023,Q4,Mark Mason,"I mean, there are a lot of factors in there.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2023,Q4,Mark Mason,"There's obviously, as well, the mix as it relates to what we have in the US versus outside of the US, so there are a number of factors there and probably too much to kind of take you through on the call here.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,

2024,Q4,Mark Mason,Let me make clear a couple of things.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q4,Mark Mason,"So one, and I've said this already, so I apologize for repeating myself, but one, our target for CET1 is 13.1%, and so what you're going to see over the course of the year is us managing down to that target?",cet1,yes,Yes,cet1,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q4,Mark Mason,That's kind of one point.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q4,Mark Mason,The second point I want to be clear is that it's not the consent order.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q4,Mark Mason,That's not something that that is impacting the capital actions and decisions that we take.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q4,Mark Mason,We obviously forecast out the performance.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q4,Mark Mason,"As I've said, Jane has said already, we see very strong continued earnings momentum, managing towards a 13.1% CET1 ratio.",cet1,yes,Yes,cet1,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,Yes,cet1 ratio
2024,Q4,Mark Mason,And you'll see the buyback trajectory reflect getting down to that CET1.,cet1,yes,Yes,cet1,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q4,Mark Mason,"The one thing I will mention, and you mentioned already is that we obviously have another CCAR process, stress test that we will go through.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,Yes,"ccar, stress test",No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q4,Mark Mason,"And none of us can predict kind of what's on the other side of that from an SCB point of view, but that will be an important factor as we get through the first half of the year and into the second half of the year in terms of kind of the level of buybacks that we will be taking on a quarter-by quarter basis.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q4,Mark Mason,So I hope that helped.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q4,Mark Mason,"There are no artificial constraints, so to speak, that are in place.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q4,Mark Mason,"This is us planning and forecasting the performance of the franchise ensuring they can fuel high-returning growth opportunities so that we're building a sustainable franchise, looking at the capital requirements that we have and the management buffer that we put in place and therefore, taking that excess capacity and putting it towards buybacks, but with an eye towards the regulatory environment that we're in, and what I mean by that are the capital requirements that come out of the annual stress testing process that's run.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q4,Mark Mason,So that's the basics of it as we sit here today.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q4,Mark Mason,"I guess I'm just trying to think about everybody is super focused on what you had said previously, now you have different targets, but is it just really like, look, it just takes longer, we'll get there, but just takes longer.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q4,Mark Mason,"And maybe just an addendum to that, how should we expect Banamex to impact that 10% to 11% RoTCE in terms of the immediate impact after IPO and then after you deploy that excess capital that you get back?",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q4,Jane Fraser,"Erika, we chose the words very carefully to say that 2026 is a way point, it's not the destination.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q4,Jane Fraser,"And when I'm looking at it, I'm looking out to 2027, 2028, what is the bank we want to be in terms of our strategy, our performance, our culture, all those different dimensions.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q4,Jane Fraser,"And we just relentlessly keep going down that path, but we're going to take the right and responsible decisions as we go down it.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q4,Jane Fraser,"So our potential is for more than our medium-term target RoTCE, the potential of the bank and the journey that we're on is to improve our returns beyond there, for sure.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q4,Mark Mason,"And just in terms of the impact and the timing that Jane referenced, just keep in in mind that the financial impact of exiting Banamex comes two forms.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q4,Mark Mason,One is the gain or loss on sale and two is the risk weighted asset release.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q4,Mark Mason,"The gain or loss on sale will run through the P&L at deconsolidation, so that's the point where we've gotten, or we've IPO-ed more than the 50%.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q4,Mark Mason,And the ultimate benefit will be driven by the RWA release when we fully divest our stake.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q4,Mark Mason,"And so hopefully, that helps, but it's not until we’ve deconsolidated that we see that P&L impact and the CTA and other things like that kind of flow through the P&L for Banamex.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q4,Operator,Our next question will come from Gerard Cassidy with RBC Capital Markets.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q4,Operator,"Your line is now open, please go ahead.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q4,Gerard Cassidy,"Jane, I'll pass on the haggis, but I'll take you up on the whiskey.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q4,Jane Fraser,I didn't say I was buying just to be clear.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q4,Gerard Cassidy,Our expense report on this end.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q4,Gerard Cassidy,"Anyway, just following up, Mark, on your comments about the IPO with Banamex.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q4,Gerard Cassidy,"Can you guys remind us, or refresh our memories, on when the IPO process starts, once it goes public, what percentage ownership do you guys expect to have?",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q4,Gerard Cassidy,"And second, have you given us any color on whether you expect to report a gain on this transaction or a loss as you just referenced, that will go through the P&L?",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q4,Mark Mason,We haven't given any sense for the exact timing of that.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q4,Mark Mason,"As you know, this is a process.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q4,Mark Mason,"And so Jane just spoke to the timing of that process, the first step, having been completed on December 1 with the separation, we are now obviously gearing up and readying ourselves for the IPO.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q4,Mark Mason,"There'll obviously be important filings associated with that given our intent to dual list, there will be regulatory approvals that are required kind of as we make headway with potential investors as part of the IPO process.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q4,Mark Mason,And so there are a series of IPO steps that we will need to take over the course of the year in order to continue to ready ourselves and there are things that we don't control.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q4,Mark Mason,"Like as Jane mentioned, the regulatory approval process and timing for that as well as the market conditions.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q4,Mark Mason,And so all of those factors are important.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q4,Mark Mason,And then how the IPO occurs in terms of percentage that is taken on at that first tranche versus follow-on tranches are important factors on when we get to deconsolidation.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q4,Mark Mason,"And so I haven't given you an exact timing on that but you can envision kind of 15% tranches that happen over kind of a 12-, 18-month, 24-month period.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q4,Mark Mason,And then obviously reaching a point of deconsolidation at which point that currency translation adjustment starts to flow through the P&L.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q4,Mark Mason,"There's no material impact on capital, but it does flow through the P&L.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q4,Mark Mason,"And then ultimately, we exit 100% over the course of time.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q4,Mark Mason,"So I'm sorry, I'm not giving you precise dates and percentages.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q4,Mark Mason,And part of that is because we are obviously on the front end of not only readying ourselves but considering alternative IPO structures and potential investors/shareholders as part of that process.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q4,Gerard Cassidy,"Well, I appreciate the insights.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q4,Gerard Cassidy,"And then as a follow-up question, and I really don't mean this as a ‘what have you done for me lately?’ type of question because you guys have made so much progress in what you're doing in your strategic changes here.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q4,Gerard Cassidy,But can you talk about the U.S.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q4,Gerard Cassidy,"Personal Banking, many of your questions today is about the RoTCE consolidated and how you can improve that, and this business has a very low RoTCE as you guys know, below your cost of capital.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q4,Gerard Cassidy,"And structurally, when you look at it, if you look at the loans at the end of period just over $220 billion, your deposits about $90 billion, which is quite a bit different than your peers who have much higher ROEs.",billion,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q4,Gerard Cassidy,So how do you approach this business?,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q4,Gerard Cassidy,"And again, I know you've been very busy divesting a lot of the businesses that are not important, but it seems to me that this is a giant hurdle that you guys have to approach at some point in the near future.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q4,Jane Fraser,Let me just chat a bit through this.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,

2024,Q4,Jane Fraser,"Personal Banking, it’s coming from top line revenue growth, improved expense base and also a lot more normalized credit environment, and that gets us to the mid- to high-teen returns in the medium term.",revenue,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q4,Jane Fraser,I think we feel very confident and comfortable in that.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,

2024,Q4,Jane Fraser,"Importantly as well, the Retail Bank has been feeding our Wealth business.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,

2024,Q4,Connor,"I know directionally, you said it's going up.",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,

2024,Q4,Mark Mason,I did not.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q4,Mark Mason,"Obviously, for both technology and Transformation those are areas that we are going to continue to invest in for all the reasons that we've mentioned.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q4,Mark Mason,"They obviously contribute to the number in 2025 being slightly down from the $53.8 billion, but they also represent, as I mentioned, what we believe is required to kind of get the work done that we need to get done.",billion,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q4,Mark Mason,And so those numbers will increase.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,

2024,Q4,Mark Mason,"Volume, incentive comp, there's merit increases that go with that.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,

2024,Q4,Mark Mason,"And so there are puts and takes, but Transformation and technology specifically, we are continuing to invest in, in order to achieve what we need to get done here and also ensure the businesses have what they need to drive sustainable growth going forward.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q4,Mark Mason,MATT O’,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,

2024,Q4,Saul Martinez,"Mark, the NII ex-Markets outlook, if I just take the fourth quarter and annualize that, I get to something in the neighborhood of, I think, around $47.4 billion, $47.5 billion which is above the full year 2024 level.",billion,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q4,Saul Martinez,"I'm not sure exactly what “up modestly” means, if that's 1%, 3%, 4%, but, and correct me if you think I’m wrong, but it seems like maybe there's a little bit of conservatism built in?",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q4,Saul Martinez,"If you can just comment on how you think, and how we should think about the quarterly trajectory of NI ex-Markets?",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q4,Saul Martinez,"Obviously, there's a day count issue in 1Q, but maybe how do you think through like, how we should expect that NII to evolve over the course of the year?",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q4,Mark Mason,"I mean, why don't I just kind of cut to the chase on it a little bit, Saul, in the sense that, “up modestly”, call it a couple of percentage points, 2 to 3 percentage points or so, right, in terms of how I think about it.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q4,Mark Mason,"And I think I've taken, I’ve gone through kind of the tailwinds and headwinds, so I won't kind of take you through that again.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q4,Mark Mason,"But I think the important takeaway should be that we're going to see continued momentum across the franchise driven by loan growth in the Branded Card side of the business and continued deposit momentum, particularly operating deposits in Services.",loan growth,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q4,Mark Mason,"And we're going to do everything that we always do around the management of pricing, and we'll get a benefit from how we've been managing our investment portfolio as those things mature.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q4,Mark Mason,"The combination of those efforts will offset, more than offset some of the headwinds that you'd expect in a declining rate environment, and modestly is, call it, 2% to 3%.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q4,Saul Martinez,Fair enough.,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q4,Saul Martinez,"And then on the expense outlook getting to below $53 billion in 2026, I know that's consistent with what you've said in the past, does imply a pretty sharp reduction in 2026, especially in light of continued revenue growth, it's pretty material operating leverage.","billion, revenue",no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q4,Saul Martinez,"Just I mean, how much benefit do you get from a more normalized severance?",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q4,Saul Martinez,"In other words, how much are we thinking about severance coming down?",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q4,Saul Martinez,"What's sort of the impact or how to think about the Legacy, stranded costs coming down?",,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q4,Saul Martinez,Just maybe a little bit more meat on the bone in terms of how much these items will benefit 2026 versus 2025?,,no,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q4,Mark Mason,"Look, a couple of things.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q4,Mark Mason,"As I look at our severance costs, which, as I mentioned, has been running high, it was $700 million, we're forecasting $600 million in 2025.",million,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q4,Mark Mason,"I think kind of normal through the cycle is probably, call it, $300 million or so.",million,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q4,Mark Mason,And so that gives you some sense for that.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q4,Mark Mason,"I think the other thing is, if you look at the other page, and again, there are a number of drivers or levers that we intend to pull to bring that down.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q4,Mark Mason,"But in the All Other page where you look to the right, we show wind-downs and what's remaining in terms of Legacy Franchise.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q4,Mark Mason,"If you add those numbers together, $1.9 billion or so of expenses and think about a subset of that being stranded.",billion,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q4,Mark Mason,And we're going to continue to focus on how do we bring down stranded costs over the next couple of years.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q4,Mark Mason,So those are two important factors or contributors to the decline from the slightly lower than $53.8 billion to the $53 billion.,billion,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q4,Mark Mason,There are additional productivity saves from prior investments that we've made.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q4,Mark Mason,But those are important factors.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q4,Mark Mason,"And then as we look at the Transformation spend, that will continue to, or start to pay dividends or help to bring down costs as well.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q4,Mark Mason,So you've got really those four variables that contribute to us bringing that number down.,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
2024,Q4,Mark Mason,"And as Jane has mentioned, we're going to even post 2026, continue to bring, or drive out more inefficiencies around the organization to fund required investments for the business growth and all with a continued focus on getting to less than 60% as we exit 2026, less than 60% operating efficiency.",,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,
